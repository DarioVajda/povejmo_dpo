# Jaylen Brown indifferent after nearly tying career-high vs. Spurs

Boston Celtics third-year shooting guard Jaylen Brown scored a season-high 30 points against the San Antonio Spurs on New Year’s Eve, just two points shy of tying his career-high of 32 points that he set against the Chicago Bulls at the end of the 2017-18 regular season.  Considering the opponent, a Spurs squad that has become one of — if not the most — respected franchise in the NBA, you may have expected Brown to be pleased with his performance.  Especially after a rough season that’s seen him averaging 12.0 points, 4.1 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 0.8 steals per game on a career-low 43.3 percent shooting from the field and 28.4 percent shooting from three-point range (also a career-low).  However, true to his character, Brown’s primary concern was whether the Celtics won or lost and considering that his 30-point outburst came in a losing effort, the 22-year-old wing said “it really didn’t make that much of a difference” that he had his best scoring game of the season on Monday.  Per MassLive‘s Tom Westerholm:   “We lost, so it didn’t really make much of a difference,” Brown said. “Just come out, come into the new year and continue to win some games.” Celtics head coach Brad Stevens says he wasn’t surprised by Brown’s game against the Spurs since he played well against the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday, going 3-3 from the field and collecting four rebounds in 19 minutes as Boston won 112-103.  However, Stevens shouldn’t have been surprised simply because in December, Brown had his best month of the season, averaging 13.5 points, 4.0 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 1.0 steal and 0.6 blocks per game while shooting 49.2 percent from the field, 34.1 percent from three-point range and 70.0 percent from the charity stripe.  Further, with Brown removing the silicon pad on his right hand that protects a bone contusion from taking the full force of a blow — but one that also made it harder to play basketball — this type of performance may have been overdue.  *All stats gathered from Basketball Reference<|im_end|>

# Building on school needs

Virginia schools require a perennial effort to address the backlog of delayed capital project A concrete plan to address the years-long list of roof repairs, HVAC upgrades and other capital needs at Virginia schools deserves serious consideration. State Sen. Bill Stanley’s proposal would use a predicted windfall of new sales taxes collected from online purchases to pay for costly school infrastructure projects. It’s a reversal of fortune for school officials, many of whom have avoided cuts to classroom programs in recent years by deferring needed work on facilities. In the past decade, the commonwealth cut off funding to help schools pay for capital needs, even as the steady drumbeat of high-priced projects marched toward a crescendo.  During those years, roofs were patched instead of replaced. Trailers were favored rather than building expansions. And Depression-era schools continued to be utilized well beyond their useful life. State Sen. Staley, R-Franklin County, plans to introduce legislation that would distribute up to $4 billion in bonds to school divisions for infrastructure projects. The proposal would set in motion a process to get a statewide referendum on a ballot for Virginia voters to decide on. The bonds would be paid for using sales tax collected from internet retailers. In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door for states to collect more taxes from online businesses, creating $250 million in projected additional revenue each year for Virginia. The senator wants to apply half of the sales tax collections to pay for the debt service on the bonds. The state senator’s proposal comes at the same time Gov. Ralph Northam plans to set aside $80 million in his proposed budget for loans that schools can use to pay for capital needs.  The governor wants to revive a state school construction grant fund and a low-interest loan program that dried up following the 2009 recession. His plan is a one-time offer and does not address the annual demands created by the commonwealth’s aging buildings. It also does not address what would happen in the commonwealth falls on similarly hard economic times that initially caused the funding programs to collapse nearly a decade ago. The capital needs facing Virginia’s educators demand a steady source of funding year after year and not quick one-time infusions of cash. And they are much larger than the $80 million Gov. Northam has proposed. A Newport News facility study, completed last year, tallied up $505 million in maintenance and other projects needed during the upcoming 15 years. The average age of the division’s buildings is more than 50 years. Those figures were not produced by mismanagement by Newport News officials; they are simply the product of years of balancing the costs of programs and facilities.  Worse yet for poorer localities is that they do not have the cash to pay back loans offered by the state, eliminating their school projects from contention regardless of the need. State Sen. Staley’s bond proposal could be improved by including safeguards such as a rating system administered by a statewide commission that prioritizes proposed projects in a similar fashion used by Hampton Roads to plan transportation projects. Such a process would be open for public input and scrutiny and would be a transparent way to prioritize school infrastructure needs, regardless of whether they benefits students in Hampton Roads, Franklin County or beyond. The senator’s proposal uses a highly coveted pot of money that several other legislators have already suggested the General Assembly use for other needs. But education is the one common denominator that we all rely on to advance the commonwealth’s goals. There is no mistaking that Virginia’s existing system of funding schools needs to be repaired. Just ask the students and teachers who once occupied Huntington Middle School, which closed in June after parts of the 85-year-old building began to crumble. City and school officials are still considering what to do with the property. Or consider Kecoughtan High School, where pupils and educators must routinely leave the main building to walk outside to nearby trailers that double as classrooms. Mobile trailers are used throughout the Peninsula because the funding to expand schools is unavailable. State Sen. Staley’s proposal would go a long way to address the commonwealth’s issues. And with some reform, that stream of money could be utilized and prioritized in a public way that benefits schools across Virginia.<|im_end|>

# What Nnamdi Kanu Told Igbos To Do In New Year Message

Kanu, who came out of hiding in October 2018 after the military invasion of his community in Abia State, southeast Nigeria in 2017, made this comment during a ‘special’ New Year broadcast on Tuesday, January 1, 2019. During the New Year Day broadcast, the pro-Biafra activist insisted that a referendum for the Republic of Biafra must be conducted, stressing that without the referendum, he and other pro-Biafra activists will boycott the general elections scheduled for February.  “There is a difference between Anambra election and presidential election, in presidential election the world will be watching. If you want to be free, boycott the presidential election and the zoo will crumble,” the IPOB leader said.  Kanu is leading a group seeking secession from the Nigerian state. The group has since been proscribed by the Nigerian Government.<|im_end|>

# Wells Fargo to pay $575 million to settle state investigations

Breaking News Emails Wells Fargo will pay $575 million in a settlement with attorneys general from all 50 states and the District of Columbia that are investigating fake accounts opened without the knowledge of customers and a string of other dodgy practices. Under the agreement announced Friday, the bank will also create teams to review and respond to customer complaints about its banking and sales practices. The bank has been under a cloud since 2015 when it acknowledged that employees had opened millions of fake bank accounts for customers in order to meet sales goals. It has also said that it sold auto insurance and other financial products to customers who didn’t need them. Wells Fargo has already been ordered to pay more than $1.2 billion in penalties and faced stricter regulations. “This agreement underscores our serious commitment to making things right in regard to past issues as we work to build a better bank,” said CEO Tim Sloan. Tim Sloan apologized for the phony accounts and other practices during a congressional hearing in 2017, but the company remained under pressure from the weight of all the scandals. The company has announced plans to lay off up to 10 percent of its workforce over the next three years. California, the bank’s home state, will get more than a quarter of the settlement funds because of the number of Wells Fargo customers residing there. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the bank’s behavior “disgraceful”. “Wells Fargo customers entrusted their bank with their livelihood, their dreams, and their savings for the future,” said Becerra. “Instead of safeguarding its customers, Wells Fargo exploited them, signing them up for products - from bank accounts to insurance - that they never wanted. This is an incredible breach of trust that threatens not only the customers who depended on Wells Fargo, but confidence in our banking system.”<|im_end|>

# Mike Babcock: "The backup goalie position is a hard position mentally" | Maple Leafs Hotstove

Mike Babcock addressed the media after practice on Wednesday, discussing the injury status of Frederik Andersen, Garret Sparks’ adjustment to the NHL backup role, and the next-generation game against Minnesota on Thursday afternoon.  When you look at the balance of your club, how important has that been in managing the minutes right from front to back as you proceed in the season toward the Spring?  Babcock: We like to do that for sure. You look at a team like Tampa, who has got the ability to really play their lines, and that’s what we’d like to do, for sure. We think it is the best long-term. Sometimes, I don’t know if you notice, but in the games we lose, we overplay our guys because we are chasing the game. In the games that we win, we always get good minutes out of everybody because you’re not chasing the game. It is one of those things. Start on time, play everyone, make everyone important. Everyone on our team has an important job, whether it be power play or penalty kill, and we try to make everybody important. In the end, I think that’s how you have team success.  Any update on Frederik Andersen?  Babcock: No update on Freddy. He didn’t practice with us today, so obviously, we are not going to see him tomorrow. And then we have a practice day in between. I don’t know if he can practice one day and come… Now, he’s practicing every day. He’s on the ice, he’s doing his thing, and he’s feeling pretty good. I don’t know… I don’t ask him. When they tell me, I’ll know.  How much better have you seen Sparks become since he was named the backup out of camp?  Babcock: I think the biggest thing is just composure. I thought he played and made a lot of good saves against the Islanders. I thought, when the fourth goal went in, he got rattled for a bit. There is no sense in getting rattled. There is no sense in getting wound up. It is the next shot. That’s what it is. Some days, it doesn’t go in. Some days, it does. You regroup and you get back at it.  To me, it is a process. The backup goalie position is a hard position mentally. You see a lot of veteran guys doing it. You don’t see as many kids doing it. There is a reason. It is mentally hard. He is getting an opportunity right now, though, to show what he has. I think that is what you are always hoping for. You are preparing in life for your opportunity and when you get your opportunity, you want to show that you are ready for that opportunity. That is the challenge. The hardest thing in pro sport is confidence, but you need it.  It is a different type of game tomorrow with the kids and the next-generation game. How important is it for you to plant that seed for a new generation of kids?  Babcock: To tell you the truth, I never really thought about that. It’s a two o’clock game, so breakfast is at a different time. We’ve got to play real well.  I think we do a real good job here in Toronto with our fan base and with kids and doing everything we can to sell the game. I think Mr. Tanenbaum is really into that, and it’s a special thing. I just know, from being involved in our national team and the World Juniors and all of that stuff, how big of a deal it is for Canada. The more grassroots hockey you can have… The only way you get good players is if you have grassroots hockey. Obviously, sharing in the community is so important.  I like a two o’clock game. I really like it on the road when you are coming home. We can’t seem to get that done very much around here, though. I don’t know. I’d like to have some two o’clock’ers on Saturday. I’m just putting in some shilling. Two o’clock’ers on Sunday. Anyway, what else do you guys want?  Does the process change much for an early start like that?  Babcock: I mean, obviously, for myself… You’d go home in between. You come in earlier. We did way more in prep today. We did way more preparing for Minny today in our practice than we would. What we’ll do is we’ll bring our guys in that need to eat. The kids that are in close can come in and eat and we’ll make sure we’ve got good meals for them. The guys that have got someone to do that for them, they don’t have to come in.<|im_end|>

# ‘China, China, China’: Trump’s new Pentagon chief sets US defence priority

‘China, China, China’: Trump’s new Pentagon chief Patrick Shanahan sets US defence priorities  Patrick Shanahan tells key Pentagon staff to focus on the US National Defence Strategy, that highlights the ‘Great Power competition’ with Russia and China Patrick Shanahan, the acting US defence secretary, started his first full day at the Pentagon’s helm Wednesday by telling colleagues he sees China as a key priority.  Shanahan, who took the top spot January 1 after James Mattis resigned amid disagreements with US President Donald Trump, told key Defence Department staff to focus on the National Defence Strategy, a broad review that highlights a new era of “Great Power competition” with Russia and China.   — Acting SecDef Pat Shanahan (@DepSecDef) January 2, 2019 “While we are focused on ongoing operations, Acting Secretary Shanahan told the team to remember China, China, China,” a defence official said.  The US accuses Beijing of an ongoing pattern of military and economic espionage, and has criticised China’s ambitious “Belt and Road” trade and infrastructure initiative as being a form of economic coercion.  In a post-Mattis South China Sea, can the next US defence chief do what needs to be done to prevent war? 
 “In 2019, the National Defence Strategy remains our guide. America’s military strength remains our focus,” Shanahan said in a New Year’s message on Twitter.  The defence official said Shanahan would later Wednesday attend a cabinet meeting with Trump, the president’s first of 2019.  Little known outside business and Washington circles, Shanahan takes the world stage at a time of tumultuous changes and unpredictable foreign policy moves under Trump.  Shanahan did not serve in the military but has worked since July 2017 as the deputy defence secretary. Before that, he spent more than 30 years at Boeing.  Mattis, dumped by Trump, gave this advice to Pentagon staff on his final day as US defence secretary 
 Among the most immediate issues on his plate will be the pace at which the US pulls 2,200 or so troops out of Syria, following Trump’s decision last month to exit the war-torn country.  According to US officials, Trump is also mulling a 50 per cent draw down in Afghanistan – another momentous move that has left lawmakers and international allies fearing for what comes next.  Shanahan announced that Pentagon comptroller David Norquist will perform the duties of deputy secretary of defence, the official said.<|im_end|>

# Opinion | Bernie Sanders' Bungled Response To Sexual Harassment Claims Won't Cut It In 2020

It is not surprising to learn that Bernie Sanders’ 2016 campaign had a sexism problem. It is more surprising — and much more disappointing — that Bernie Sanders does not know how to convince women that he cares. Politico and The New York Times reported this week that 24 individuals — men and women — had signed a letter calling for a meeting with Sanders about the toxic environment that developed over the course of his previous primary campaign. The New York Times further reported the allegations: Women were groped and mocked for reporting it (“I bet you would have liked it if he were younger,” one manager reportedly told a woman who said she had been touched by an unnamed campaign surrogate), paid thousands of dollars less than male colleagues with similar jobs, or marginalized when they refused to share hotel rooms with managers. The staffers who signed the open letter have emphasized that they are asking for a meeting with Sanders in order to strengthen his potential 2020 candidacy, not tear him down. “They stressed that they hoped their letter would not be reduced to reinforcing the ‘Bernie Bro’ caricature,” according to the Politico report, meaning they did not want to characterize Sanders and his supporters as unilaterally, unfixably sexist — and said sexual harassment is endemic to political campaigns everywhere. Survivors who have come forward have typically expressed their strong and continuing support for Sanders’ policies. If the Times report or the open letter had been handled graciously, it could have been interpreted as a sign that a 2020 Sanders campaign would be a Me Too vanguard. That is not how it was handled. When CNN’s Anderson Cooper questioned Sanders about the sexual harassment allegations, the senator avoided addressing them for several minutes, prefacing his comments about the allegations with a monologue about how his primary campaign had been a successful force for good. He denied knowing about the harassment, framing it as a distraction from his more important work — “I was a little busy running around the country trying to make the case,” he said — and apologized “to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately,” rather than simply saying, point-blank, that multiple women were harmed. I didn’t feel like I was not treated appropriately. I wasn’t. There is no subjectiveness to this. Zoey Jordan Salsbury, former president of American University Students for Bernie The response from survivors has been one of deep pain. “That half-hearted apology he throws in is the 1st any of us female staff have heard out of him in the 2 years since we brought this to his attention in early 2017,” tweeted Masha Mendieta, who repeatedly has alleged that Sanders knew about the problem. “I’m not quite sure how to put into words how furious I am right now,” tweeted Zoey Jordan Salsbury, the former American University Students for Bernie president who spoke to HuffPost about her experiences in November 2017. “I didn’t feel like I was not treated appropriately,” Salsbury told me Thursday in an email. “I wasn’t. There is no subjectiveness to this.” “His apology sounded like a classic non-apology that so many women know all too well,” she added. “And it only came after he mentioned how many states he had won. ... I wish I had gotten a true apology a year ago, when I came forward. Instead I got a call from a lawyer who blamed me for being harassed.” The survivors are right to protest: In one breath, Sanders minimized the allegations to a matter of hurt “feelings” while also implying such matters were beneath his notice. He talked up how successful his campaign had been ― then said the women who worked on it, and who made it so fabulously successful, were not people he paid attention to or cared about. “Bernie wanted, and likely wants still, to be president of the United States,” Salsbury told me. “Staffing up a campaign and then a government is a crucial part of that job. You can’t dismiss abuse that happens under your authority because you’re ‘a little busy.’” Sanders addresses gender politics when and only when someone forces him to. He acts like someone who does what he’s been told is most feminist but ultimately doesn’t get what the big deal is or why all these women are yelling. Sexual harassment and sexism are a problem in every industry and at every point on the political spectrum. There were reports of sexual harassment on Hillary Clinton’s and Kamala Harris’ campaigns, too; when power is patriarchal, women who work in and around politics will experience violence no matter who they support. But Sanders seems unable to convince women that he takes it seriously, and that failure is on him. In fact, this has been a recurring problem for Sanders, who tends to respond dismissively, even aggressively, to anyone who presses him on issues outside his bailiwick. Gender is one of them: He has finger-wagged reporters who questioned him about the desire for a female president, and he called Planned Parenthood a part of “the establishment” when the organization opted not to endorse him. In response, Sanders’ supporters have said he is about substance, not token gestures. He invariably votes pro-choice. He advocates for substantial paid family leave. His 2018 campaign for re-election to the Senate included strong policies against sexual harassment. By aggressively dealing with poverty, he mainly benefits women and children, who are the majority of the nation’s poor. If you believe the most economically progressive candidate is the most feminist candidate, then in most scenarios, the most feminist candidate is Bernie Sanders. In reality, many women still feel he is indifferent to their cause — and this is now evidently true even for some women who care deeply about him, who gave substantial parts of their lives to his campaign and went through hell to “make the case” to the American people. Sanders addresses gender politics when and only when someone forces him to. He acts like someone who does what he’s been told is most feminist but ultimately doesn’t get what the big deal is or why all these women are yelling. In blowing his apology to the women in question, he gave ammunition to those arguments — and at exactly the wrong moment. When Sanders declared his candidacy in 2015, he was a unique phenomenon. Many voters were willing to overlook his flaws simply because there were no other avowed socialists in Congress. In 2018, the Sanders movement is much bigger than Sanders himself, and many of the standard-bearers for the left flank of the Democratic Party are women. There’s Elizabeth Warren, who was advocating aggressive economic populism well before Sanders rose to prominence, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has young Democrats ready to ride or die for her, and, yes, the women who worked on and around the Sanders campaign. Sanders may have been a vehicle for some of those women to advance their own ideals, but he is not the sole embodiment of them. He would do well to listen to those women, and to make the changes they need. If Bernie Sanders can’t speak to women about their concerns, they are more than competent to replace him — and continue speaking for themselves.

# Handmade: Curvie's Hats, Etc. is a dream come true

It's rare that you come across a boutique where everything in the shop is handcrafted by its owner, but Curvie Jones of Detroit happens to be the creator behind all the women's garments and accessories sold at Curvie's Hats, Etc. The multi-talented fiber artist has been stock-piling items she's made over the years, using her knitting, crocheting, sewing, felting, spinning and dyeing skills. Retired from Detroit Public Schools as a third grade language arts teacher, Jones opened the doors to Curvie's Hats, Etc. (23426 Woodward) in Ferndale in November of 2017, after "about four years" of searching for the perfect location. "I've always wanted to do this," she stated. "I've been making things since I was at least three years old. I've always had a stock pile of things I made, and I thought as soon as I retired from school I'd open a business, but it didn't happen for years. I've done shows, like bazaars, and I've been encouraged to open a store, and I finally did it! It took a while to find a location." Many of the items she makes -- knitted and crocheted scarves, hats, jackets, coats and felted wearables -- are done using fibers that she spins herself. Among other items she makes are silk tops and scarves with fabric she dyes, using a Japanese technique called Shibori. "I make them in the store and in my home," said Jones, admitting she still has "a love for making things." I have a workshop in the rear of the store with a sewing machine, and I take my spinning wheel (to the shop). I'm also learning to weave, so I have my weaving loom there (as well). And, needless to say, she's never without her knitting needles and crochet hooks. Jones said she's a "kind of self-taught" fiber artist, but admits she took one class in felting with the Birmingham Bloomfield Art Association, and then honed her skills by doing a lot of reading. "I get my wool from people who deal with wool roving, and many raise their own animals, and those who don't, get their roving from New Zealand." Because she spends about 4-5 hours a day, working to add to her already large inventory, Jones, so far, has not had to worry about running out of items to sell. "I never get low because I've been making things for so many years. I have boxes full of things. I have a surplus," she said, adding that she sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night to work on a project. And, though some of her items were made some time ago, she's not at all concerned with her merchandise being out-dated because the pieces are wearable art, which is always in fashion. Other than her knitted and crocheted hats with pom poms, she said, "I don't think anything I have is trendy, so it's not a matter of them being out of style because they're not trendy." Jones creates her own "style" for the pieces she makes, many of which are one-of-a-kind. "I try to make my own style, and I try not to be too repetitive, so that you won't see a lot of the same things. (Also), I find it very boring to repeat the same thing over and over." Back when she did church bazaars, she said her "average customers were women between 40-70," but now that she's opened her boutique, "the age is dropping down between 30-70." When, and if, she decides she's "done with the phase of making," Jones said she'd like to return to teaching by opening a school for young girls coming out of foster care and for those who were incarcerated, as a way to help them develop fiberart skills. In the meantime, she's considering adding a bit of variety to items in the shop by bringing in handmade goods by other local artists -- "something like jewelry." During the winter months, Curvies Hats, Etc. is open 1-5 p.m. Wed.-Sat. Parking is available in front of the store, on two side streets, and in "a little driveway in the back." Detroit News columnist Jocelynn Brown is a longtime Metro Detroit crafter. You can reach her at (313) 222-2150, jbrown@detroitnews.com or facebook.com/DetroitNewsHandmade. Contact Curvie's Hats, Etc.

# Names of Irish couple who won Euromillions jackpot revealed

Names of Irish couple who won Euromillions jackpot revealed  Frances and Patrick Connolly from Co Armagh scooped €127,483,852.86 in New Year’s Day lottery draw  Frances Connolly (52) and Patrick Connolly (54) from Moira, County Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA Wire  The Co Armagh couple who won the EuroMillions jackpot have been named as Frances and Patrick Connolly.  The pair, who are in their 50s and from the small town of Moira, had been expected to go public.  They won the New Year’s Day lottery draw and spoke to the media about their winnings on Friday at the Culloden Hotel in Holywood, near Belfast.  They won a total of £114,969,775.70 (€127,483,852.86), making them the fourth-biggest UK lottery winners in history.  Northern Ireland has had a history of big wins.  In December 2013, an unemployed woman from Strabane, County Tyrone, won almost £27m in the EuroMillions lottery.  At the time, Margaret Loughrey said that on the day she bought the ticket, she had been to the job market to get an application form for a job with a charity.  In 2004, a cancer patient from Belfast became the biggest ever winner of the UK’s National Lottery.  Iris Jeffrey scooped £20.1m with a ticket she bought on 14 July but only realised she had hit the jackpot the following month after hearing an appeal by lottery organisers Camelot.  In October 2017, an anonymous winner from Spain won €190 million – the maximum jackpot prize.  A couple from the UK won €190 million in 2012, while another anonymous winner from Portugal won €190 million in 2014.  Dolores McNamara remains Ireland’s biggest ever EuroMillions winner, having won €115 million back in 2005.  In the New Year’s Day draw, 10 other players took home £1 million in prize money each.  The winning main EuroMillions numbers were 01, 08, 11, 25, 28 and the winning EuroMillions Lucky Star numbers were 04 and 06. – Additional reporting PA<|im_end|>

# Orlando man charged in fatal New Jersey crash

ORLANDO, Fla. - Authorities in New Jersey have arrested a Florida man in connection with a multi-vehicle crash that killed a pedestrian. Alvin Mootoo, 46, of Orlando, is charged with death by auto and other offenses.  The Passaic County prosecutor's office said Mootoo was driving a Buick Encore in Paterson on Wednesday night when he hit a 2008 Honda Accord, causing Mootoo's car to strike a parked 1999 Honda Accord. Jorge Alberto Pena Mesa, 31, of Newark, who was having a conversation with someone in the parked car, was struck and killed, officials said. Mootoo made an initial court appearance Thursday. It wasn't immediately known if he had retained an attorney who could comment on the charges. The state has filed a motion to detain Mootoo that will be heard at a later date.

# EFCC raises alarm over scam mail - Vanguard News Nigeria

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has raised the alarm over the scam mail by fraudsters, who claim that such mails were from the commission.  This is contained in a statement by the commission’s Acting Head, Media and Publicity, Mr Tony Orilade, in Abuja, on Friday.  The statement says: “The attention of the EFCC has been drawn to the activities of fraudsters, who disguise as officers of the commission and send scam mails to individuals, purporting such to be from the EFCC.  “This is with the aim of extorting money from them.  “The commission has uncovered a number of email addresses, telephone numbers and websites used by unscrupulous persons to perpetrate such fraudulent activities, and is acting on them.  “In some instances, they send fraudulent emails, letters and make telephone calls to unsuspecting members of the public by also impersonating government officials and organisations.  “While alerting the public of these fraudulent activities, the EFCC states that anyone who enters into any agreement with any such impostor does so at his/her peril”.  According to the statement, the EFCC has stated several times that none of its officers will demand for gratification to “kill” an investigation.  It also said no operative would invite a suspect to any location apart from EFCC’s designated offices, which can be found on its website.  “Members of the public are, therefore, advised not to send money to any fraudster demanding money in the name of the EFCC for whatever purpose, and to desist from engaging in any communication with them,” he said.

# BBM - New Songs, Playlists & Latest News - BBC Music

BBM Biography (Wikipedia)  BBM ("Bruce Baker Moore") is the name of the short-lived power trio formed in 1993 by long-established artists, bassist Jack Bruce, guitarist Gary Moore (both of whom had collaborated previously on Moore's Corridors of Power album) and drummer Ginger Baker. They released just one studio album, entitled Around The Next Dream, which was released on the Virgin record label. It reached Number 9 in the UK Albums Chart in the summer of 1994, but spent only four weeks in the listings. The track, "Where in the World" was issued as a single, reaching Number 57 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1994. Much of the work was written by Moore with contributions by Bruce and Baker. The album cover featured a picture of Baker. The band went on a short UK tour to coincide with the album's release and also played a handful of rock festivals on the continent, before disbanding.

# Virginia Republicans say taxpayers would save $440 million under their plan

Countering a proposal from the governor to give some tax breaks to low-income Virginians, House Republicans on Friday unveiled a plan that they say will give broad tax relief to the middle and lower classes. In a press conference, Speaker of the House Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, said the GOP’s plan would change the state code to allow Virginians to itemize deductions on their state tax returns, even if they take the standard deduction on the federal tax returns. Right now, if you take the standard deduction at the federal level, you must also do so when you file your state taxes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — the federal tax overhaul passed in December 2017 — doubled the standard deduction at the federal level. Virginia Republicans, who hold a narrow 51-49 majority in the House of Delegates, argue not changing the state law amounts to a tax increase on the middle class, shortchanging some filers who would save more money if they could itemize on their Virginia returns.  “This is not what hardworking families in Virginia need right now,” said Del. Tim Hugo, who serves as the Republican caucus chairman. “Today we are standing up and saying no to a tax hike on the middle class.” In addition to changing the law, their proposal would increase the state standard deduction from $3,000 to $4,000 for individual filers and from $6,000 to $8,000 for a married couple who files jointly. They said that would affect 2.7 million Virginians who claim the standard deduction. “This will especially help low-income Virginians who do not itemize their taxes,” Hugo said. Their proposal, which they say would affect more than 600,000 filers, would use about $440 million of the $1.2 billion the state is expecting because of changes in federal law. Cox said there would be discussions on how to spend the rest of that money during the session.  The tax proposal comes as lawmakers get ready for a short, 45-day legislative session starting Wednesday. They’re expected to make more than a few adjustments to the biennial budget as the state receives a influx of cash coming from the federal tax changes, a larger-than-expected sales tax surplus and anticipated funding from the internet sales tax. Gov. Ralph Northam’s proposal is to make the Earned Income Tax Credit fully refundable. That means if the credit you qualify for is more than what is owed in taxes, you get the additional amount back when you file, rather than the state keeping the money. But the EITC is available only to individuals without children who earn $15,010 a year, or up to $48,340 if individuals claim three children. About 600,000 taxpayers would be eligible in Virginia.  Northam’s amendments to the current $118 billion, two-year budget are intended to focus attention on the difference between tax revenue that’s a short-term windfall and money that will be around for the long haul. The Democratic governor’s spending plan also includes more funding for teacher raises, school construction, more broadband access and fattens up reserves. House Democrats in a news release called the GOP’s proposal “reckless,” adding it would “shortchange education, transportation, and public safety needs in order to further enrich the wealthiest Virginians.” Del. Chris Jones, a Republican from Suffolk who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said any tax changes need to be done fast — in the first 10 to 14 days of the session — to take effect for 2018 filers. If it’s not passed in time for people to file their 2018 taxes, the GOP plan proposes a one-time additional deduction for filers on their 2019 tax returns. And any tax changes would expire in 2024, when the federal tax breaks end. “We need the governor to come to the table as soon as we get into Richmond next week and have a discussion on an agreement on tax policy,” Jones said.

# US Democrats vote to reopen government sans wall funds

US Democrats vote to reopen government sans wall funds  New House Speaker Nancy Pelosi termed Trump's wall proposal as 'waste of money' and 'immorality' as government shutdown entered 13th day  The House Democrats, on their first day in office, voted on a legislative package to reopen the government, rejecting US President Donald Trump's call for additional funding to build a wall on their border with Mexico.  Along with the legislative package, the House of Representatives also voted on the stopgap spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security — without allocating additional funds for the wall — during their first day in the House. Five Republicans joined the Democrats in passing the bill 239-192.  The House of Representatives' move may add to the stalemate between lawmakers and Trump. Earlier on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence had reiterated, "if there's no wall, there's no deal".  The new House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, on the other hand, slammed Trump's wall proposal as a "waste of money" and "immorality". With no relief in sight, the partial government shutdown marked its 13th day on Thursday.  This story has been sourced from a third party syndicated feed, agencies.

# These are the quirkiest properties for sale in Cornwall right now

The most unusual properties currently on the market feature everything from an abandoned military camp to a former vicarage that's been given a striking makeover by a multi RIBA award-winning architect.  Quirky doesn't necessarily mean expensive, with the price points ranging from as little as £85,000.  There's plenty to discover at the following locations and many offer a wealth of Cornish history. Which one captures your imagination the most?  Penhale Camp, Holywell Bay  Up to 700 soldiers returning from war would once head to this now eerie location along the cliff tops near Holywell Bay.  Once a hub of military activity, it is here they would train and recuperate following another gruelling tour.  Penhal Camp is closed off to the public by a two-metre high metal security fence topped by razor wire, and the 97 buildings on the 16 hectare site have stood derelict for eight years.  Evidence of the gun sites, searchlight batteries and defensive positions, such as pillboxes and trenches, still remain today.  The price is available on application, with the listing available to view on the Bruton Knowles website here.  St Pinnock Church, near Liskeard  This former parish church is a grade one-listed building that dates back to the 14th century. Complete with bell tower, feature carved wooden ceilings and leaded glass windows, the property possesses a multitude of attractive qualities.  Jefferys is marketing the property at a guide price of £85,000. The estate agency reveals that the west tower was rebuilt in the late 14th century and the nave in the 15th century.  The latter half of the 15th century saw the north transept demolished and the south isle erected along with a four bay arcade.  A porch was later added in the 16th century. The church is believed to have been "heavily restored" between 1881 and 1882, whereby the south transept and parts of the eastern side of the building were rebuilt.  Richard Metherell, from Jefferys Liskeard, said: "The church has been shut for a couple of years. Numbers had dwindled and the church have decided to see what interest there is and to test the market out."  Screech Owl Sanctuary, near Wadebride  One of Cornwall’s much loved family attractions is for sale. The award winning Screech Owl Sanctuary is brought to the market through Miller Commercial for £1,000,000 for the freehold interest.  Situated in St Columb, the property is set in approximately 10 acres comprising extensive buildings and owners accommodation.  As well as being a haven for owls, the business has animal enclosures for donkeys, alpacas, meerkats, Shetland ponies, emus, pygmy goats, geese, ducks and raccoons. There is also parking for 200 vehicles.  Graham Timmins at Miller Commercial said: “Every now and then we are asked to market really special properties and businesses, Screech Owl Wildlife Park is right up there. This business is very well known throughout Cornwall and has its’ roots firmly planted in the conservation and understanding of this amazing wildlife.  “Our clients Tom and Carolyn are now, after 30 years, ready to hand over their very special business, to coin a phrase this really is a unique and rare opportunity.”  St Keverne Methodist Church, near Helston  This former house of worship has been vacant since January 2017, when the United Methodist Church St Keverne was established following the amalgamation of the Methodist churches of Ponsongath and St Keverne.  The building was constructed in 1906 and resides in the heart of the village with the coastal havens of Coverack and Porthallow nearby.  Planning permission has been granted for two residential units and prospective purchasers will take note that the church is not a listed building. There is also permission for the creation of extra parking to the back of the hall.  The property is for sale through The Mather Partnership and affords a £150,000 guide price.  Trenoweth House, near Camborne  At first glance from the outside, this detached house in Crowan looks like any other rural dream home. Yet behind the front door lies a unique residence that combines raw exposed elements with a minimalist decor that's sure to get property hunters talking.  Trenoweth House is a grade two former vicarage that showcases a captivating Gothic style. The house, together with three self-contained cottages, sits within 3.5 acres of natural gardens.  The estate dates back to 1880 and, according to the English Heritage and Pevsner’s Guide to Cornwall, was originally designed by Cornish architect JP St Aubyn. Fast forward nearly 140 years and the building has been restored by multi RIBA award-winning architect Amin Taha.  Lillicrap Chilcott, the estate agency marketing the property, reveals that the building was in a complete state of disrepair when Taha purchased it, to the point where the grounds were impassable and there was even a tree growing in through one of the windows.  It's for sale for £1.55 million.  Fernlea Terrace, St Ives  The former home of a man who could have easily inspired Winston Graham's Poldark has been put on the market for the first time in more than 100 years.  Similarly to Aidan Turner's character Ross Poldark in the hit BBC One period drama, Halse also became an MP and made his fortune by mining tin.  Once described as "one of the most enterprising and successful adventurers in mines" of his day, Halse died in May 1838, leaving his fortune to his nephew. Lillicrap Chilcott is marketing the residence.  The Moorings, St Mawes  While this home might appear somewhat unassuming from the outside, a step inside the front door reveals a luxury that affords a £1.95 million price tag.  The four-bedroom Victorian residence lies on Lower Castle Road in St Mawes. Not only does it enjoy spectacular waterfront views but the home boasts direct water access, a rarity in the village.  The Moorings has been restored and refurbished in recent years and features an enviable ground floor sitting room with two fireplaces and a large bay window framing the sea.  A communal courtyard is accessed from the rear with a store room opposite. Immediately across the road from the house is a terraced garden which descends to the foreshore.<|im_end|>

# Is this fair? De Blasio's rocky roll out of discounted MetroCards for the poor continues - NY Daily News

The promise of the Fair Fares program championed by the Community Service Society and the Riders Alliance was clear: Offer half-priced bus and subway fares to 800,000 New Yorkers at or below the poverty line, giving them a break worth $700 a year on an essential of city life.  As of Friday afternoon, when Mayor de Blasio and Council Speaker Corey Johnson kinda sorta kicked things off at a Harlem subway station, just one New Yorker, Lenise Brown, had the special MetroCard in her pocket; others were told they could start applying.  And not enough others. De Blasio and Social Services Commissioner Steve Banks are offering the discounted cards to about a fifth of the expected population, 160,000 people, leaving 640,000 folks without, as Controller Scott Stringer correctly points out.  Only 30,000 of that subset, including Brown, are eligible now, leaving the other 130,000 having to wait until April, which is also when cut-rate pay-per-ride cards rather than just unlimited will be available.  So it will be 10 months since de Blasio grudgingly went along with Johnson’s push to fund Fair Fares last summer, before any more than a tiny fraction will be allowed to join.<|im_end|>

# Palmetto woman fires multiple shots to protect home from intruder, deputies say

The Manatee County Sheriff’s Office responded to reports of a domestic disturbance involving gunfire Saturday.  Around 7:43 a.m., deputies arrived to the 600 block of 45th St. East in Palmetto, where neighbors said they heard multiple shots fired. A 33-year-old Palmetto woman said she was just trying to protect her home.  According to the sheriff’s office, a 33-year-old man who used to live in the house showed up unannounced to retrieve a few of his belongings that he left behind. He reportedly entered the home without making his presence known first because he did not see the homeowner’s car in the driveway.    Digital Access For Only $0.99  For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.  #ReadLocal  The shooter was asleep when she heard him enter, deputies say. She fired three shots because she thought she heard a burglar breaking into her back door.  A 4-year-old boy was asleep in bed at the time, according to the sheriff’s office. No one was injured in the incident.  The woman stopped shooting when she recognized the person. Deputies say she allowed him to grab his bags and leave. The sheriff’s office was able to detain the man as he left the scene and interview him. Investigators came to the conclusion that the shooter was protecting her home.  Deputies said the handgun “disappeared from the scene and was not located,” according to a sheriff’s office report. No arrests were made as a result of the incident.<|im_end|>

# Jeffrey Lee Pierce And The Gun Club To Be The Focus of Upcoming ‘Elvis From Hell’ Documentary

Fans of Jeffrey Lee Pierce’s band, The Gun Club, will be pleased to learn that this seminal group will very soon be featured in an upcoming documentary titled Elvis From Hell, which will chronicle the history of The Gun Club along with Pierce’s profoundly interesting musical journey. Pierce’s life tragically ended at the young age of 37, after he finally succumbed to the effects of HIV, alcoholism and heroin addiction.  As Deadline reports, Elvis From Hell will feature interviews from a multitude of other musicians and artists who all hailed Jeffrey Lee Pierce as an extraordinary and legendary figure, with Jack White even going so far as to suggest that The Gun Club’s music “should be taught in school.”  Other artists who are set to be interviewed about The Gun Club include Nick Cave, Jim Jarmusch, Moby, Mark Lanegan of The Screaming Trees, Kid Congo Powers and, of course, Deborah Harry of Blondie. It should be noted that Jeffrey Lee Pierce was such a staunch supporter and fan of Blondie that he was once the president of the band’s fan club in the United States, and Deborah Harry returned the favor with her strong public admiration and support for his music, eventually becoming a lifelong friend of Pierce’s.  For The Jeffrey Lee Pierce Sessions Project — a collaborative project of different artists that was set up in 2010 to pay tribute to Pierce — Deborah Harry also sang with Nick Cave on The Gun Club song “Breaking Hands,” from the band’s 1987 album Juno.   “The sun and sea are smiling/While you’re going to bed/Wish Allah would will me/A piece of iron in my head”  Elvis From Hell is due out in 2020 https://t.co/jEfARfPnih  — Pitchfork (@pitchfork) January 3, 2019 Johnny Depp has also cited The Gun Club as having a profound effect upon his life, once stating that they were by far his “favorite band.”  The Elvis From Hell documentary will be a German and American partnership between director Heiko Lange — who was responsible for B-Movie: Lust and Sound in West Berlin— and Jessica Andree, who worked on The Noise of Cairo. The film will be produced by Anahita Nazemi and Katrin Sandmann from Kobalt Production, along with Scott Crary from Hunger Artist Productions.  If you’re longing to see more of Jeffrey Lee Pierce and want to know when the production of Elvis From Hell will be completed, you’ll be glad to know that The Gun Club documentary is set to be released in 2020, and that its sales and distribution is currently being worked on right now.<|im_end|>

# Opinion: A year of emotion and sweat equity

I have been incredibly fortunate to work with so many talented journalists across the country. I have had the privilege to be part of several great stories, projects and initiatives that have had a tremendous impact in our communities. I really can't believe I get to do this for a living. Within that context, I don't think I've ever been more proud or more touched by a body of work than our State of Emergency: The Opioid Crisis. Reporters Kelly Kultys, Jenny Wagner and Marion Callahan, photographer Kim Weimer and enterprise/investigative editor Crissa Shoemaker put in more emotional and sweat equity into our yearlong series than any reader could possibly imagine. Callahan made me tear up last Sunday when I read her reporter's notebook missive that started like this: "I wanted to give her my boots. "The petite blonde woman in her 30s stood shaking beside a soaked backpack containing all of her belongings. Her lips were cracked and her teeth chattering on this frigid January day in a pocket of Kensington known as the "ground zero" of the opioid epidemic. "When offered help, her gaze fell to her feet. She needed a size 6. I’m a size 8.5. "I stopped reporting, put my phone in my pocket, and sorted through a heap of donations in an outreach center for something to replace her thin, soaked boots, the cause of the most immediate source of pain." If you know Callahan, you know how genuine that is. Early in the project, I cautioned the highly energetic Kultys that the emotional toll of telling these stories was real and to make sure she took care of herself. She did wonderfully with this project, but I know it affected her because the opioid crisis affects so many people her age (mid-20s). Her reporter's notebook shared a story of a young woman she never met, Sabrina, with whom Kultys connected, even though Sabrina no longer is here. "For me, personally," Kultys said, "meeting many, many families; many, many people in recovery; many, many people trying their best in this industry, really made me more abrasive or upset whenever I (still) hear people say, 'Why don't you just let them die?' or 'Why should we help them when they did this to themselves?' "I know those people either haven't met someone with addiction or haven't seen a family destroyed by it. Because if they did, I really think their tone would be a little different. ... I know I hope that our work at least opened some people's eyes or helped them understand some of the struggles people with addiction and their families face each day." Wagner, a health reporter with a heart of gold, put in an enormous amount of work to make the State of Emergency website an everlasting resource, beautifully done and organized. "I've been overwhelmed by the response to our final stories and the new website," Wagner said. "We aimed to be as thorough as possible in our reporting for this series; to not just rehash the problems, but to ask what is causing them, and what, if anything, is being done or could be done to solve them. "Not everyone wanted to answer those questions or talk about the problems, let alone solutions. But we didn't let that stop us." Weimer has made the series come to life with her striking photos that brought such emotion to the series. She has an eye for capturing just the right moment, even in times of great pain for victims and their families. Shoemaker kept everything together. Her byline doesn't show up on stories in the series, but her imprint certainly does. "So many people have been touched by addiction, including my own family," Shoemaker said. "It's a disease that carries with it heartache, and stigma, and I am forever grateful to the people who opened their homes to our reporters to tell the stories of their lost loved ones. "I'm equally thankful to those in recovery who have shared their stories of hope with us. It takes a tremendous amount of courage to lay bare your life to a stranger — let alone thousands of them who have read our stories over the past year." The series is the best of what local journalism should accomplish. One of the great health crises of our time, it's real in our community and needs light shined upon it. To Callahan, Wagner, Kultys, Weimer and Shoemaker, I'm forever grateful for your dedication to this project. If you helped change one life or made one family cope better, the effort was worth it. And I'm certain you touched many more than one.

# 3 takeaways from UNLV’s 68-56 win over Wyoming

Three takeaways from UNLV’s 68-56 victory over Wyoming on Saturday at the Thomas & Mack Center:  1. UNLV held serve.  The Rebels opened Mountain West play as substantial favorites against Colorado State and Wyoming and won both games.  It didn’t matter that UNLV struggled to beat Colorado State 78-76 on Wednesday and was down two points at halftime to the Cowboys. The Rebels, using a 16-2 run, took control in the second half.  This is UNLV’s first 2-0 start in conference play in 13 years, especially important given the soft early part of its schedule.  Now it gets more difficult with Tuesday’s game at New Mexico. The Lobos hadn’t done much to scare anyone with a 7-6 record, but then they thrashed No. 6 UNR 85-58 on Saturday.  That result made clear the Rebels will need to pick up their game.  UNLV coach Marvin Menzies essentially acknowledged as much by noting which teams the Rebels’ two victories came against.  “We didn’t beat Reno and San Diego State in the first two games,” he said. “We’ve got a tough schedule ahead of us. It’s good to get us some momentum going and get some confidence going with the guys. So we’ve got to go on the road, and we’ve got to be tested there again and see how they handle that.”  2. The Rebels need more than Joel Ntambwe.  UNLV’s best hope to beat New Mexico is if players in addition to Ntambwe step up.  He scored a career-high 31 points against Wyoming and was the only Rebel to reach double digits.  Kris Clyburn made 1 of 10 shots.  Amauri Hardy was 1 of 9  Noah Robotham hit 2 of 9.  Ntambwe shot 64.7 percent, making 11 shots. His teammates were a combined 27.5 percent, also making 11 shots.  It was good enough against a depleted and struggling Wyoming team. Such a result wouldn’t be at New Mexico.  3. Wyoming is, uh, not good.  The Cowboys have two weapons.  Justin James and Hunter Thompson combined to score 32 points.  The rest of the Cowboys? They scored 24 points.  It doesn’t help that two of their better scorers — Hunter Maldonado (13.8-point average) and Jake Hendricks (11.4) — were out with injuries.  This team has lost seven of its past nine games for a reason.  “It was one of those that it felt like if we just did us, we would be OK,” Menzies said. “We didn’t do that the first half (trailing 32-30), but we got to it the second half.”<|im_end|>

# Pat Lam excited about trying to topple La Rochelle again

Bristol Bears will face French Top 14 side, La Rochelle, after securing their place in the quarter-finals of the European Challenge Cup following their record-breaking victory over Enisei STM.  Bristol recorded their biggest winning margin in a competitive fixture in the club's history and also scored the most tries in a competitive fixture, as they scored 107 points in the 107-19 win.  La Rochelle topped Pool 4, but due to the seeding, will again face Bristol in the next round, with the two sides already having played twice this season. The Bears won out in France just a few weeks ago in terrible conditions but also lost quite convincingly in the reverse fixture.  Pat Lam was keen to suggest that focus must now move back towards the domestic season, but admits he is excited about the prospect of another away trip to France later in March.  "These are the sort of games you want. We got a taste for the fortress of La Rochelle last time but this time, with the sun shining maybe, full house, it will be defening.  "The atmosphere will be awesome and it is something we can look forward to when it arrives."  Pat Lam believes that, despite Bristol already beating La Rochelle out in France earlier in the pool stages, this game will be a completely different story.  "We were the first away team to win there in a long time. It was a big crowd and a big moment for the growth of this side.  "But it's irrelevant now because it's got a different context now, as its a knockout game not a pool game.  "Being in this stage is huge for the development of this team and this club. Everything is on the line, there's three big games to win for some silverware.  "We got a lot of chances today but in those games you only get a few."  Lam enjoyed the victory and said the players would enjoy their evening tonight, but insists there is a lot of time between now and the quarter-final and there are important games still to come.  "The good thing is that this game is now in April so that drops down now as just another fixture and we will worry about it then.  "It's all put a side now. We need to get a win next week in the Premiership Cup so it's another big game next week. We want to get into another semi-final so that is a huge game for us.  The Bristol Bears host local-rivals, Exeter Chiefs, at home next weekend in the Premiership Cup, knowing a win could see them qualify for the semi-finals.  And with all of the talk about finals and silverware, Pat Lam insisted that his side are very much in this competition to win it.  "You've got to be in it to win it. 20 teams started, now its eight. We have a one in eight chance and we will do everything we can. "<|im_end|>

# WAVE Country trees, cars, houses could be impacted by flash freeze

LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - Heavy rains paired with a steep drop in temperature may cause a flash freeze this weekend in WAVE Country.  The flash freeze is expected to happen Saturday night into Sunday morning, with lows in the single digits on Monday, according to WAVE 3 Weather meteorologists. It could impact everything from cars to houses and trees.  Those at J-Town Hardware said when it comes to homes, residents should first try to keep the cold air out of them, and prevent their pipes from freezing.  Workers recommend that if you don’t have a heater near the pipes, to let the water trickle through them, and put a cover over your spigot outside.  They add its also important to unscrew your garden house. That’ll make it so a pipe freeze doesn’t happen as quickly.  “You’ll know it because you’ll lose water immediately, but you wont know if the pipe is busted until it starts to thaw," Brad Carson, a manager at J-Town Hardware and Rental, said. "So, usually, what happens is in the middle of the night, you’ll start hearing this noise when it’s thawed out and that’s when the water is flooding the home.”  Carson said electric heaters are the safest to use, adding you should never use generators inside a house if the power goes out.  The heavy rain could also make the roadways a dangerous, icy place to be.  In additional to hazardous driving conditions, cold air can make it so your car doesn’t run properly.  According to Autotrader, you should be aware that a weak battery in the summer could become a dead battery in the winter.  Also, you should make sure you’re not low on coolant and monitor tire pressure.  The car-centric business states its important to fill up tires with air, if needed, as temperatures drop.  If you do drive with low tires, you could put more wear and tear on them, which could lead to unpredictable handling and an accident.  Carson said J-Town Hardware often sees a lot of interest in drivers buying salt for their own driveways when the weather gets icy.  “We have a lot of rock salt and a lot of sand and things like that," Carson said. "We have tow straps if you happen to get stuck.”  Experts also add it’s important to keep a survival kit in your car if you happen to breakdown.  Those at J-Town Hardware said they’re ready for what the weather brings, as they are fully stocked on the three S’s: salt, sleds and shovels.  The flash freeze on the way could cause problems with trees, as well.  Branches covered in ice knocked down power lines and blocked city streets after a storm last fall in Louisville. Trees with leaves, that had large surface area, caused issues when frozen over with weighed-down limbs.  That may not be an issue in the winter, but business owners said there are still some concerns. The extra weight ice places on weak branches, and dead wood, may cause them to fall.  Those at Louisville Tree Service said that’s especially true during a quick freeze like the one we’re expecting.  To prevent issues, they said it’s best to maintain your trees in advance.  John Ridgill, the owner of Louisville Tree Service, said eight similar weather incidents put strain on trees in 2018.  That creates somewhat of a viscous cycle -- making it so tree businesses have to switch to emergency repair mode, instead of doing regular work that could prevent future tree issues.  “It can really just impact your workflow and trying to do your regular maintenance of your customers," Ridgill said. "So, we really just tell people to be really proactive throughout the year.”  Ridgill said large trees can be pruned every three to four years and smaller ones should be maintained every 12 to 18 months.  Even in winter, he added, if it doesn’t rain or snow for a couple weeks, you should water your trees.<|im_end|>

# EXPERT EYE SURGERY – it’s magic! - The Bristol Magazine Online

Every day patients are lost for words when they undergo life changing eye surgery. All three eye health specialists at Nuffield Health Bristol Hospital, The Chesterfield, have a passion for their profession and stress that the work they perform is hugely rewarding.  A consultant ophthalmologist for 10 years, London trained Mr Rafik Girgis, provides skilled and safe hands. To stay abreast of latest technology, he is involved in publications in national and worldwide journals and international medical conferences.  With a surgical expertise in cataract surgery and premium implants, Mr Girgis says, “All measures are taken to give complete peace of mind before, during and after the procedure. Every option is given, including different types of implants and anaesthesia to suit.  “In deciding on the lens type, it depends on a lot of factors; age, other health issues, occupation, hobbies and what the individual wants to achieve from cataract surgery. I can guarantee that colours and brightness will get better and in most cases, it will restore vision. The best part of my job is having the skills to enhance vision to bring back the sharpness of colours and help improve the blurriness, guaranteeing patients a much happier and improved way of life.”  A graduate of Bristol Medical School, followed by specialist training at the highly eminent Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, Mr Philip Jaycock became a consultant eye surgeon at Bristol Eye Hospital in 2010. A microsurgical skills trainer and research contributor, the most common eye conditions he treats are cataracts, keratoconus, dry eye and those patients who wish to reduce their need for spectacles and contact lenses.  Mr Jaycock explains his career choice, “When I was 11 years old, I thought that sight was the most important sense that we have, so I decided to become an eye surgeon. In the largest study of its kind, my research paper on the outcomes of 55,567 cataract operations was used to update national and international benchmark standards for cataract surgery. Also in one of the longest follow-up studies of laser eye surgery, I published a paper showing the long-term safety and effectiveness of laser eye surgery.”  Mr Jaycock’s patients report on their remarkable restoration of their sight: “The cataract operation has given me back a way of life I had gradually been losing.” “Perfect eyes and no more lenses or glasses. From start to finish, I felt I had the best possible treatment – well informed and reassured. The results of refractive lens exchange surgery are fantastic!”  Consultant cataract and retinal surgeon Mr Mo Majid trained in Bristol and Liverpool. A renowned expert in cataract surgery, he uses all the latest types of lenses including premium multifocal, continuous range, trifocal and toric lenses to reduce your reliance on spectacles and contact lenses for both distance and near vision – a technology not available on the NHS.  Mr Majid has advanced skills in managing cataracts and is regularly referred complex cases from across the south west. He is also a respected expert in treating macular degeneration and vitreoretinal surgery. He can help in all areas of eye health and has published over 30 peer reviewed papers.

# Paleontologists In Cambridgeshire Have Discovered The Skull Of An Extinct Buffalo That Lived 150,000 Years Ago

Paleontologists in Cambridgeshire, England have recently discovered the skull of a prehistoric and extinct buffalo that roamed the Earth 150,000 years ago after unearthing the animal’s skull in a quarry.  As the Daily Mail reports, the surprising discovery was made by a fossil enthusiast who is a frequent visitor to the quarry, and despite finding hundreds of buffalo bones at this location, this fossilized skull is the first time that a complete skull has been discovered here.  It has been determined that the extinct bison priscus was 6.5 feet tall and weighed an enormous 2,000 pounds. Jamie Jordan, the man responsible for this unique discovery, runs Fossils Galore museum in Cambridgeshire, and has described the moment when he first stumbled upon the 150,000-year-old buffalo skull.   “As we were going through the quarry we saw some splintered pieces of bone on top of the surface, and I thought to myself, that’s a bit strange. I have mainly come across maybe one half of a skull at a time so it is very unusual to find everything together. I had a closer look and it turned out to be a horn cone from a buffalo and removed the loose horn core and there was still a large bone underneath.”  — ISLHE #FBPE #StopBrexit #peoplesvote ???????????????????????? (@SallyR_ISLHE) January 19, 2019 After further excavation, paleontologists discovered the other pieces of the buffalo’s skull and, as Jordan noted, despite having been thoroughly crushed, the Ice Age animal’s skull was nevertheless complete, even down to its massive jaws.   “Even though we can see it’s been crushed, it’s complete with the jaws and everything – we’ve found them before, but not both halves together.” Once washed and weighed, the skull of this extinct buffalo was determined to be between 45 and 55 pounds, and Jordan now believes that other bones that were found at the Cambridgeshire quarry may have come from this same animal, and he intends to conduct further investigation to see if he can find other missing pieces of the bison priscon.  It is being reported that Jordan and his team were also the individuals who were responsible for the astonishing discovery of an Iguanodon skeleton that was found in a quarry in Surrey in 2017, and which had been buried at the site for around 132 million years.  The complete skull of the 150,000-year-old buffalo that was found in the Cambridgeshire quarry will be worked on over the next two months so that it will be perfectly preserved and will then be shown to the public, along with many of the other amazing finds of Jamie Jordan.<|im_end|>

# Jazz fires sparkling final round to win Singapore Open

SINGAPORE: Thailand’s Jazz Janewattananond played a sparkling final round to win the Singapore Open golf with a record-breaking score Sunday, seeing off tough challenges from Paul Casey and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Jazz was impressive on the front nine and made the turn with a three-stroke lead, before finishing with two birdies in the last three holes to seal victory.The 23-year-old shot a final round 65 for an 18 under 266 total. It was the best four-round score in a Singapore Open staged at the Sentosa Golf Club, and beat Adam Scott’s record 17 under set in 2010. “I had a good 2018 and I did not know if my game was still there or not as I had a big break (from playing) — but I am happy that I have still got it,” Jazz said. The Thai player finished two shots ahead of world number 24 Casey of England, who matched Jazz’s final round 65, and overnight leader Yoshinori Fujimoto of Japan, whose birdie at the last saw him card a 68. Fitzpatrick, the world number 40, snapped at Jazz’s heels for most of the last round but back-to-back bogeys on 15 and 16, where his drive ended up in a hazard, ended his challenge. He shot 69 for fourth place, four shots behind the winner. The win was Jazz’s third on the Asian Tour.There was disappointment for defending champion Sergio Garcia of Spain who finished in joint seventh place. He struggled after being hit by a sinus infection and an upset stomach at the start of the tournament.<|im_end|>

# Lebanon uses Arab summit to call for Syrian refugees' return

Lebanon uses Arab summit to call for Syrian refugees' return  BEIRUT -- Lebanon used an Arab economic summit on Sunday to call for the return of Syrian refugees to safe areas of their war-torn country, where the nearly eight-year civil war is still underway despite a recent series of government victories.  President Michel Aoun told the opening session that Lebanon is overwhelmed by the presence of Syrian and Palestinian refugees, who make up about half the population of the tiny country, which is struggling with an economic crisis.  The meeting is the first economic and development summit to be held since 2013, and comes as Syria, Yemen and Libya remain gripped by violence and Iraq confronts a massive reconstruction challenge after its costly victory over the Islamic State group.  Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit said nearly half of all refugees "come from our Arab world."  Qatar's ruler attended the summit, which has been marred by divisions over readmitting Syria to the Arab League. But Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani arrived shortly before the summit and left minutes after it began.  Qatar has been one of the main backers of Syrian insurgents trying to overthrow President Bashar Assad.  The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have reopened their embassies in Damascus, and the visit by Qatar's ruler is widely seen as a first step to restoring relations with Syria.  As the summit was ongoing in Beirut, Syrian state media reported that the country's air defense units repelled an Israeli airstrike near the Damascus International Airport. Such attacks have usually occurred at night but Sunday's air raid happened during daylight hours.  Sheikh Tamim and the president of Mauritania were the only heads of state from the 22-member Arab League who came to Beirut to attend the summit. Other countries sent lower-level delegations.  The other leaders' absence appeared to be a snub to Lebanon, where groups led by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah had insisted that Assad should be invited.  "We regret the absences of some brotherly kings and presidents who have their justified excuses," Aoun said without elaborating.  "We call for a safe return of Syrian refugees to their country, especially to stable areas that can be reached and areas of low levels of violence," Aoun said in his opening address. "This should not be linked to reaching a political solution."  Lebanon is home to some 1 million Syrian refugees, a quarter of the country's population.<|im_end|>

# Red Wolves win second straight in league play

Ford led A-State off the bench with a season-high in points thanks to a 6-of-7 mark from beyond the arc to help the Red Wolves move to 7-6 on the year and 2-0 in Sun Belt Conference play. With the loss, ULM fell to 6-7 and 0-2 in the league. Payton Tennison also finished in double-figures with 11 points, while Peyton Martin added 10 points and six rebounds.  Saturday’s game featured 13 lead changes, but none after the 3:23 to go in the third quarter when Trinitee Jackson knocked down two free throws to put A-State ahead 42-41. A 9-0 run in the fourth quarter stretched the lead to double-figures for the first at 58-48 after 3-pointers by Ford and Tennison and a strong effort in a zone defense helped spark the run. “I thought the biggest key to the game was when we went zone in the fourth quarter,” A-State head coach Brian Boyer said. “I thought it really got them on their heels and I really think it was the difference in the fourth quarter.” The Red Wolves were able to take away the Warhawks’ ability to drive the ball to the basket late in the matchup and came away with key rebounds as ULM tried to chip away at the lead. A pair of free throws by ULM’s Amber Thompson got the deficit down to 58-52, but Akasha Westbrook answered on the opposite end with a pull jumper and Martin got a layup off one of six assists for Jireh Washington to stretch the lead back to 10 points. A-State had 17 assists on 20 made field goals, while also shooting 47.4 percent (9-of-19) from the 3-point line. The bench also outscored 31-7, and the Red Wolves got 12 fast-break points while limiting ULM to four. “This is two games in a row where we’ve had more assists than turnovers and that’s really good to see,” Boyer said. “It isn’t a stat line I always look at it because of how hard we attack off the dribble and the tends to keep our assists down, but what has been good is lately these teams are sagging so much defensively on us and we can’t get to the rim so it is good to see us making the extra passes.”  Arsula Clark led three ULM players in double-figures with 18 points, while Lauren Fitch added 14 and Amber Thompson had 12. Arkansas State will take to the road for the first time in the league when it travels to South Alabama to take on the Jaguars Thursday, Jan. 10 at the Mitchell Center. The game is set to tip-off at 7:05 p.m. and will air on ESPN+.<|im_end|>

# Stephen Baxter: Crusaders boss wants to see Belfast rivals Glentoran back on song

Crusaders boss Stephen Baxter saw his side dispatch struggling Glentoran from the Irish Cup - then stressed a desire to see the troubled club return to former glory days.  Preparations for the fifth-round tie featured a management change as Gary Smyth gained the Glens hot seat in the aftermath of Ronnie McFall’s resignation. Although Smyth and coach Paul Leeman had a sole training session in which to rebuild a Glentoran squad stuck in the worst run of league results across the Oval outfit’s history, both can call of course on decades of experience connected to the club as highly-successful players plus, since May 2018, the management team. Defeat by 4-1 to Crusaders following a Paul Heatley brace and goals from Jordan Owens then Matthew Snoddy killed off hopes of any Irish Cup run but Smyth accepts the true challenge comes in pursuit of league points. A debut goal for Lukasz Gwiazda offered a rapid response to Heatley’s first before the hosts’ superior strength served to send Crusaders marching on and Glentoran aiming to move forward off initial baby steps under Smyth. “You have to be pleased with four goals, home victory and into the hat,” said Baxter. “I thought the travelling support for Glentoran was exceptional and brilliant to see them back in numbers. “I hope they continue to back two exceptional guys in Gary Smyth and Paul Leeman, two very good friends who are great football people and great Glenmen. “It will be exciting as they’ve very good players at Glentoran and just need that break of the ball. “Gary and Paul will do an exceptional job, leaving no stone unturned and I wish them every success in the future. “I’ve said it for the last four, five or six years that the league needs a strong Glentoran. “It’s a huge club, I was there as a 16-year-old and spent two or three seasons with Glentoran. “It needs investment and people to come in and back what’s going on but there are very good people at the club. “There are people I’ve known a lifetime connected to Glentoran, people I would call friends, so I really want to see the club back in it. “They talk about the ‘Big Two’ of Linfield and Glentoran, then there is Crusaders and Cliftonville, so when all four clubs are going well the big numbers are out and Belfast football is lively and exciting. “There might be some rivalry and high competition but mutual respect.” Although Smyth will value the plaudits from his old friend and new managerial rival, the Glens boss is aware of the need to push forward - bolstered by the cup tie’s initial positives towards long-term league progress. “For an hour or so it was 50-50 and we probably had the best chances over a first half in which there was nothing between the sides,” said Smyth. “It was important, after conceding the first goal, that we got back quickly but then disappointing for the second and third, plus a backpass leading to the fourth. “It’s a cliche to praise the effort and at half-time we stressed it’s not about pats on the back for working hard. “There was a good feeling beforehand and after the equaliser we were looking to go to the next level. “Crusaders showed their class to respond and you are still in the balance at 2-1 but then to score inside our ‘six’ on the bounce for number three, we should probably be doing better defensively, with the fourth heart-wrenching but Nathan Kerr had played so well so he and the team didn’t deserve it. “Crusaders got stronger as the tie went on, they are fit and sharp with everyone wanting it. “It was cagey at 1-1 and 2-1 but, naturally, the boys’ heads dropped at 3-1.”<|im_end|>

# Total lunar eclipse LIVE pictures: How to watch Super Blood Wolf Moon in the US

The total lunar eclipse will be the only US citizens will be able to see this year. Millions of people throughout the country, as well as Canada and South America, will be able to see the full eclipse as it journeys through its cycle. The sequence bears a particular significance for the US, as the super blood wolf Moon was named so by Native Americans. Native people named he Moon after the effect it had on local wildlife, as it was responsible for causing wolves to howl regularly. How to watch the blood Moon from the US Those based on the East coast will be able to see the start of the eclipse from 9.36pm EST. This is when the Moon will enter the Earth’s outer shadow, known as the ‘penumbral’ phase. After this, the Moon will enter into the shadow of the Earth’s central mass at about 10.34pm. The partial lunar eclipse begins here, and precede the period of ‘totality’ when the Moon will adopt its rusty red shade. This will take place at roughly 11.41 EST, and remain so for one hour until 12am on January 21. Those on the west coast will see totality earlier, from 8.41 pm and 9.44 pm PT. In total, the eclipse will have lasted more than five hours, as the Moon exits the Earth’s shadow by 2.48pm in the east. While many people will be able to see the whole cycle take place, there are certain parts of the US where cloud cover will make this difficult. Thankfully, there are services which will make watching the eclipse easy from the warmth and comfort of your home. The Slooh Community Observatory, based at Slooh.com will be live streaming the event. The telescope broadcasters will be streaming the eclipse from the Canary Islands and Chile from 10.30pm EST. Astronomers Paul Cox and Dr Paige Godfrey will be on hand to walk viewers through the process as it unfolds. Slooh has’t streamed any lunar events since mid-2018, and even then this was not fully visible from the US. The observatory said: “The last total lunar eclipse we experienced together here at Slooh was the Mini Buck Moon on July 27, 2018, but that was not visible from North America. “This one will be, reaching totality at 12.12am EST on January 21. “The next total lunar eclipse visible from North America will not be until May of 2021.”<|im_end|>

# Japanese artist’s love affair with trams provides perfect photo op

Hong Kong Tramways’ 115th anniversary proves too good a photo opportunity for Japanese artist to miss  Body of special edition tram includes around 350 of Koichi Matsuda’s images Operator marks anniversary with launch of Art Tram Related topics  Japanese artist Koichi Matsuda has taken as many as 10,000 photos of Hong Kong’s iconic trams over the past five years but at no time did he expect his pictures to one day feature on the vehicle he loves.  The city’s tramway will celebrate its 115th anniversary this year with the launch of Art Tram – designed by Matsuda.  The body of the special edition tram uses around 350 of his images and shows a range of eye-catching advertisements, from international retail brands to Chinese medicated oil.  The variety represents Hong Kong’s charm, where East meets West in culture, Matsuda said, adding he had never seen a tram covered in colourful advertisements before he came to the city.  “Hong Kong trams are special. In Japan, there are no double-decker [trams],” the 65-year-old said, adding that this uniqueness helped him to frame his pictures in a balanced way.  “The constant change of tram advertisements is the most suitable subject to showcase the vigorous economic growth of Hong Kong.”  Over the past five years, Matsuda has visited Hong Kong 20 times and used the same lens and camera to capture moments featuring trams, usually from the same spot – the Shau Kei Wan terminus, where he was attracted by the backdrop of old tenement buildings.  The artist said he was impressed by the billboards and clothes hanging outside homes, as well as air conditioners on the walls. The terminus allowed him to capture the three elements in one place.  From 2016 to last year, Matsuda hosted six exhibitions in Japan and Taipei after building a collection of photos of Hong Kong trams, affectionately known in the city as “ding dings” for their bell sounds.  He recalled some Japanese people said they wanted to come to Hong Kong after looking at his photos.  “Many of my friends became more interested in Hong Kong and trams after seeing my work,” he said.  But Matsuda wanted to take his art to the next level by using his photos to decorate a tram.  The opportunity came after Hong Kong Tramways “liked” one of his photos on social media, prompting him to contact the company to float his idea.  The artist was particularly happy he could decorate a tram.  “I look forward to taking a photo of this Art Tram in the same position at Shau Kei Wan terminus!” he said.  The special edition tram will run on Hong Kong Island for two to three months. The city’s first fleet of 26 trams began operations in 1904. The operator now has 164 trams running along the 30km system and carries 200,000 passengers daily.<|im_end|>

# Kliff Kingsbury to interview for multiple NFL coaching vacancies, per reports

Although two doors slammed shut on the Cardinals early on in their search for a new head coach when both Mike McCarthy and Eric Bieniemy turned down requests for an interview, another door opened on Monday when it was learned Kliff Kingsbury now will be allowed to meet with Arizona, after all. Kingsbury, the former Texas Tech head coach, had been denied permission to meet with NFL teams by USC, where he has been employed since early December as the Trojans’ offensive coordinator. In what was believed to be an unprecedented move by USC atheltic director Lynn Swann, Kingsbury wasn’t allowed to talk to either the Cardinals or the Jets, who each had sought permission to interview him for their vacant head coaching positions. Multiple reports surfaced early Monday afternoon, however, that Swann has changed his stance and is permitting Kingsbury to explore any and all available head coaching jobs in the NFL. Apparently, there is mutual interest between Kingsbury and the Cardinals and an interview could happen relatively soon. According to The Athletic's Bruce Feldman, Kingsbury met with the Jets on Monday about their coaching vacancy. The Cardinals may not be far behind. Monday marked one week since Steve Wilks and his assistants, including coordinators Byron Leftwich and Al Holcomb, were fired by the Cardinals following a 3-13 season. Arizona has already interviewed four head coaching candidates in former Dolphins head coach Adam Gase, former Colts and Lions head coach Jim Caldwell, Saints assistant head coach/tight ends coach Dan Campbell and Rams quarterbacks coach Zac Taylor. Despite three straight losing seasons and a 35-40 overall record in six seasons at Texas Tech, his alma mater, Kingsbury has become a hot commodity around the NFL. Some teams are viewing him as an ideal offensive coordinator, including the Patriots, who may be on the lookout for a new OC if and when Josh McDaniels leaves to accept a head coaching position.

# Controversial India copper plant to reopen

Sterlite: India court orders reopening of controversial copper plant  India's Supreme Court has ordered the reopening of a copper smelter that was shut down because of the environmental damage it was allegedly causing. The plant in the southern port city of Tuticorin was closed in May after police killed 13 people amid protests by residents. They said the smelter was polluting ground water in the area and threatened the fishing industry. India's environment court had cleared the plant's reopening in December. But the state government of Tamil Nadu had appealed the decision in the Supreme Court. Nine die as Tuticorin Sterlite Copper protest turns violent The grassroots movement that shut down an Indian copper plant The plant, Sterlite Copper, is a subsidiary of the UK-based Vedanta conglomerate. Protests demanding its closure had been going on for months by the time it was shut in May. But no-one had reportedly been working in the plant for nearly two months before that. The company's operational licence had expired in April and the company was waiting for the government to renew it. The state pollution control board also disconnected electricity supply to the plant, alleging that it had failed to adhere to certain agreed upon environmental conditions. But Vedanta had denied the allegations. This isn't the first time Vedanta's plans have sparked protests over environmental pollution. In 2010, the Indian government had rejected the company's bid to mine bauxite in the eastern state of Orissa. The company had said the proposed a $2.7bn investment in the area would bring jobs and development to one of India's poorest districts. But local tribespeople objected, saying the mining project would destroy their sacred hill and their source of livelihood.<|im_end|>

# Legislature: Abortion, school board felons, abandoned babies

North Dakota lawmakers are set to consider bills that range from abortion restrictions to felons on school boards to abandoned babies. They're in session Monday despite the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.  Among the top issues in play:  ABORTION  The abortion debate is resurfacing at the North Dakota Capitol.  Digital Access For Only $0.99  For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.  #ReadLocal  The House will hear testimony on two new abortion bills Monday, six years after passing some of the nation's strictest laws on the procedure, some of which never took effect or were blocked in court.  One bill would require abortion providers to inform women undergoing drug-induced abortions that it's possible they could still have a live birth if they change their mind.  Abortion-rights groups claim there is no medically accepted evidence that a drug-induced abortion can be interrupted.  A second bill would ban an abortion procedure commonly used in the second trimester that opponents describe as "human dismemberment abortion."  Abortion-rights groups say banning the dilation and evacuation method of abortion — commonly called "D&E" — is unconstitutional because it interferes with private medical decisions.  ___  FELONS ON SCHOOL BOARDS  The Senate is considering legislation that would bar felons from serving on school boards in North Dakota.  The bill is being sponsored by Republican Nichole Poolman, a school teacher from Bismarck, and Richard Marcellais, a Democrat from Belcourt and a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa.  Poolman says the legislation came at the request of the state Indian Affairs Commission.  Director Scott Davis says the bill applies to all schools but tribal leaders are increasingly concerned about school board candidates who have a criminal past.  Davis says none of the state's five tribes allow a convicted felon to serve on a tribal council. But he says they can on local school boards.  He points to a woman convicted of embezzling from a school district on the Fort Berthold Reservation who was elected to its school board in November.  Melissa Starr received 35 write-in votes to win a seat on the Twin Buttes board in a special election. Starr pleaded guilty in 2007 to embezzlement and theft and was sentenced to 1½ years in prison. She was one of seven Twin Buttes School Board members and district employees indicted on charges of conspiring to defraud the school district of more than $665,000.  The fraud involved false travel vouchers, payroll advances and bonuses. Records from the U.S. Attorney's Office show Starr has paid about $20,500 toward restitution and still owes approximately $288,000.  ___  ABANDONED BABIES  It's illegal to abandon a baby under the age of 1 in North Dakota unless it happens at a hospital. A parent of the infant or a person given consent by the parent may leave an unharmed infant at a hospital without fear of prosecution.  A bipartisan House bill would expand the locations where a parent unable to care for a baby can leave the child, such as a police station or a county social services office.  Health officials have pushed changes to the current law because many rural communities don't have hospitals and they worry about infants literally being left out in the cold.  The House Human Services Committee is expected to act on the legislation this week.<|im_end|>

# Local federal workers react to President Trump's announcement

Local federal workers react to President Trump's announcement  Local federal workers struggling without pay in the government shutdown said they don't think the president and lawmakers are serious about ending the shutdown.  Federal correctional officers from the SeaTac Detention Center said what the president is offering to end the shutdown, won't change anything.  As a federal correctional officer and an Airforce veteran, Roger Hasty II has seen many things. But he can't believe the government shutdown is about to hit its month mark with no end in sight.  "I'm livid right now. This whole thing is unnecessary, uncalled for, we have real people with real issues and we keep hearing fake promises," said Hasty.

But top democrats called the offer, "a non-starter."  "This is a common-sense compromise both parties should embrace," said President Trump.  Hasty didn't find comfort in what the president and lawmakers said.  "It's like a slap in the face," said Hasty. "We want to work, we want to provide for our family while still helping America but you're not helping us."  Meanwhile two missed paychecks later, Hasty's worry is how he will feed his two small children and his wife who's a full-time student, or how he will put a roof over their head.  "I had to write a letter to my land-lady to let her know, 'you know, sorry the rent's going to be late but I'm in the government shutdown.'"  As the vice-president of his local union, Hasty hopes lawmakers can come to the table to with real solutions to end the shutdown—and not use federal workers as bargaining chips.  "You have been elected to do a job," said Hasty. "You're getting paid to not do your job right now, but we are doing our jobs and we're not getting paid. Something is seriously wrong with that equation."  Several officers told KOMO News morale has been low at the SeaTac Federal Detention Center.  They said if people want to help, they should call their lawmakers at 866.803.8830<|im_end|>

# Arizona police to re-interview people in teenage boy’s death

Police in a Phoenix suburb say they'll re-interview witnesses and victims in the fatal shooting of a teenage boy by an officer investigating a vehicle break-in.  The statement comes after the Arizona Republic reported the truck owner told the newspaper that the police description of what happened Jan. 15 isn't accurate.  The Tempe Police Department has said 14-year-old Antonio Arce was carrying a replica handgun he stole from the truck when he was shot.  The truck's owner, Lou Silvas, says neither of the two replica guns in his truck had been disturbed.

# Commercial property: Call for creation of more office space

The current uncertain political climate means that firms are being starved of suitable office developments in Scotland’s economic centres, as investors exercise caution due to Brexit uncertainty, according to Colliers International.  Research presented at the commercial property firm’s Scottish Economic Breakfast Briefing last month showed that the country’s businesses have weathered recent political storms well, suggesting that further growth is possible next year and that the nation’s prime office space will remain in high demand. Activity was only slightly affected by the independence referendum in 2014 and the latest GDP figures suggest Scottish firms recovered better than their English peers from the shock of the Brexit vote in 2016. Patrick Ford, a director in Colliers International’s growing capital markets team in Scotland, said that the last 12 months had seen soaring office demand in Glasgow in particular, where major office deals in financial services and the public sector meant property activity for 2018 was set to be double that seen in recent years at more than one million square feet. However, Ford added: “Although there is every indication that demand for premium offices will continue into next year – there are several large companies specifically looking for space – it is another matter to persuade developers and investors to make a move at this time. “It’s unfortunate, as this should be a time of real opportunity for the city, with many key sectors and employers looking to beef up their presence, to take advantage of the skilled workforce, good communications and other advantages Glasgow offers.” In a major sign that the city’s economic strategy, aimed at nurturing key sectors such as financial services, is working, Glasgow has seen large offices sold or leased to HMRC, Barclays and Clydesdale Bank in recent months. JP Morgan is said to be among other organisations looking for new premises in the city. With demand matched by strong investor interest, Colliers has strengthened its capital markets capability in Scotland, with the recent executive appointment of an experienced advisor, Elliot Cassels, following Ford’s arrival at the firm in June last year. The latter maintained that investor interest in Scotland remains strong, especially from overseas investors, who are capitalising on the current low level of sterling. However, Ford also believes that, in common with developers, investors are inclined to wait and see what happens with Brexit. He also flagged up the additional risk presented by the possibility of a second Scottish independence referendum, which he says has not disappeared but has been diluted in the midst of Brexit. Ford said: “It’s very encouraging to see such healthy demand from major employers and value creators in the city, but business needs space to grow. “Rents are under upwards pressure and in theory that should help, but we need to see cranes on the skyline.” Beyond Glasgow, Colliers points to further encouraging signs for Scotland’s economy. Figures from the December briefing highlighted the fact what really fires demand for Scotland’s goods and services is the price of oil, which has strengthened significantly in 2018 compared with the previous two years.<|im_end|>

# Chokoe slams axe 'rumours'

Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) coach Sello Chokoe remains resolute he can still lead the Venda-based club to promotion at the end of the campaign. Chokoe has dismissed talks that he will be fired should he fail to get maximum points in their next two matches away to Real Kings and TS Galaxy respectively. "Yes I met with the management on Saturday but the meeting was never about my future. After each and every five games we meet to assess performance. it's normal. The rumours that I will be fired if we fail to get six points in the next two games are false,'' explained Chokoe. "In my contract there's no clause saying that my future will be decided by two games. it does not make sense at all. We evaluate performance after five games and that has not changed.'' Tshakhuma were one of the National First Division's pacesetters at the start of the campaign, but have since been struggling with consistency. The side has won only two of their last six outings. "We've just lost form, it happens in football. I still have faith in my squad. I am optimistic that I am the right man to inspire this club to promotion this season. We have to keep believing. there's no need to press the panic button,'' Chokoe told Sowetan yesterday. "We are playing to finish in the top three, that's our main goal. The gap between us and the teams in the top three is not big. The situation is still manageable. We will turn it around. '' NFD results: Cosmos 0, Maccabi 1; Stellenbosch 2, Eagles 0; Galaxy 3, Richards Bay 0; Sporting 1, Mbombela 2; Tshakhuma 1, Uthongathi 2; Spurs 1, Umoya 2; AmaTuks 1, Kings 1; Ubuntu 2, Ajax 3.<|im_end|>

# Project Pandora - latest video demo appears

Project Pandora – the handheld gaming console concept that looks like a hybrid Sony Vaio P portable computer meshed with a Nintendo DS gaming console – is apparently not 'vapourware' after all, if a new demo video is anything to go by. While we await the March release of Gamepark's latest GP2X Wiz, it has all gone a little quiet on the Pandora front over the last few months. In the last contact we had with the developers before Christmas, they informed us that all heads were down as they tried to get the first batch of a few thousand consoles/handhelds manufactured and out to potential developers and homebrew fans. Proof of concept? The concept and specs that we've seen to date are really all we've had to get excited about and – like many others – we had largely dismissed the entire project as 'vapourware' that would most likely never see the light of day, especially in a world dominated by harsh commercial reality. We've contacted the developers over at Pandora again this week, so stay tuned for further updates and (whisper it!) a possible release date! Head over to YouTube now for a look at the device.<|im_end|>

	Amaravati (AP): Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu Monday alleged on Monday that the Centre was threatening to impose President's Rule in the state but, he said, nobody would be cowed down by such threats.  He claimed Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a "negative leader" under whose leadership the country was regressing.

# Let it be / ZROBYM architects

Architects  
 Location  Minsk, Belarus  
 Client  Restaurateur Vlad Lunevich  
 Area  130.0 m2  
 Project Year  2018  
 Photographs  
 Category  Text description provided by the architects. We started this project two and a half years ago, in 2016. Initially, the concept of the bakery was the opposite - it was a black brutal loft. In fact, at the moment such brutalism would not surprise anyone. Everyone is accustomed to such interiors.  And when Vlad Lunevich (restaurateur) returned to us a year later to revise the concept, we were very inspired. A year later, our team began to remodel project. We looked at this project quite differently than a year ago. It was necessary to create an interior that would become a pleasant background for guests. T  he whole character of the interior is modest, restrained, while almost completely filled with custom solutions. All the furniture was made to order. Gypsum panels in the hall and vestibule were also made to order. A small story came out with lamps, according to the project we made another main light in the hall.  For some reason, we had to offer another version of the lamps at the time of implementation. Therefore, we proposed to take the floor lamp IKEA and hang it. Tile on the floor of the factory VIVES, we offered it at once with several other flooring options. Fortunately, the tile was chosen.<|im_end|>

# Mercyhurst men rally to defeat Pitt-Johnstown

The Lakers improved to 11-4 overall and 6-4 in PSAC play with their third consecutive victory.  Nelson Maxwell poured in 31 points, including a key 3-pointer in a 10-0 second-half surge, as the Mercyhurst men rallied to defeat Pitt-Johnstown 74-69 in a PSAC men's basketball game at the Mercyhurst Athletic Center on Monday. The Lakers improved to 11-4 overall and 6-4 in PSAC play with their third consecutive victory. Mercyhurst fell into a 22-10 deficit in the first half before getting back into the contest with an 11-2 run that featured three 3-pointers by MiyKah McIntosh. The Lakers were behind 32-28 at intermission before taking the lead with their 10-0 run that started with three free throws by McIntosh that tied the game at 36-36. Maxwell hit his 3-pointer and Jason Massey added a pair of baskets to give Mercyhurst a 43-36 advantage, and they never surrendered the lead again. Maxwell finished 9-of-14 shooting from the floor (including 4-of-7 on 3-pointers) and connected on 9-of-10 free throws. Massey added 15 points and six rebounds while McIntosh finished with 12 points for the Lakers. Josh Wise led UPJ with 21 points and Caiden Landis added 15, while John Paul Kromka had a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds.

# Tsipras seeks to build on benefits of USA trip

SYRIZA leader Alexis Tsipras resumes his duties in Athens next week after completing his trip to the USA, with the first test of his decision to hold talks in Berlin and Washington due on the weekend, when the leftist party’s central committee meets. SYRIZA leader Alexis Tsipras resumes his duties in Athens next week after completing his trip to the USA, with the first test of his decision to hold talks in Berlin and Washington due on the weekend, when the leftist party’s central committee meets.  Tsipras’s decision to meet with the likes of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and the IMF’s deputy chief David Lipton is seen as part of an effort to take SYRIZA in a more pragmatic direction, a “realistic switch,” as some commentators have labeled it.  Recently, SYRIZA MP Dimitris Papadimoulis, from the party’s moderate wing, explained that in order to convince more people who are unhappy with the government to support the leftists, they would need to “provide an alternative plan for governing and a quick and effective transformation of SYRIZA into a single party, without dissenting voices.”  Tsipras’s visit to the USA, during which he distanced himself from claims he would tear up Greece’s loan agreement, seems to have helped establish his and the party’s credentials as a realistic alternative to the coalition government.  “Initially, there was concern about Mr Tsipras,” Bill Antholis, managing director of the Brookings Institution in Washington, where Tsipras spoke, told Sunday’s Kathimerini. “Anyone who leads a party called Coalition of the Radical Left provokes skepticism here. Most people who heard him speak found him to be a smooth politician, less radical than they expected.” Source: ekathimerini.com<|im_end|>

# Why Shaun Wane is backing successor Adrian Lam to be huge hit with Wigan Warriors

Adrian Lam has been tipped to be a huge success at Wigan – by the trophy-winning coach he replaced.  Shaun Wane met up many of the squad yesterday when the Warriors were honoured at a civic reception. Wane later had a lengthy chat with Lam– who he coached alongside in the academy 14 years ago. And he has full confidence the former halfback will deliver more good times to Wigan. Wane said: “We had a good chat, about everything – my role with Scotland, individual players, how he’s getting on. “He’ll do well, he’s a very smart coach, he works hard. “Lammy will do well, they have a lot of good players and a good culture here – and he’ll carry that on. “I’ve’ a lot of mates here, I’m a Wiganer, I obviously want them to do well – and I think they will.” Wigan invited Wane to join them at the council reception. He had previously been asked to attend the Sports Personality of the Year event, but it clashed with his commitments with Scotland RU. “It was good to see everyone again,” continued Wane. “These kind of events aren’t really my thing, I feel like I’m not part of it anymore, but these lads have played a huge part of my life and it was good to see everyone again. “I was very honoured to be asked and I’m glad I came.” Wane, meanwhile, says he is enjoying his part-time role as high performance coach at Scotland RU. “The week after the Grand Final, I drove up to St Andrews and I must admit I had a bit of a wobble because I’d gone out of my comfort zone,” he said. But it’s very enjoyable. They are understanding what I’m about and they’re open minded, they want to improve – and that’s important. “It’s nice that people in and around Wigan still stop me and reminisce about certain games. “I even bumped into some Leeds fans up in Edinburgh and they stopped for a chat – I imagine they were nicer to me than if I was still at Wigan!”<|im_end|>

# Jack Young confirmed for 2019 Renault UK Clio Cup grid - The Checkered Flag

Belfast’s Jack Young is to return to the Renault UK Clio Cup in 2019 with MRM Racing following a partial campaign at the end of last season.  The seventeen year old joined the grid at Snetterton and made an immediate impact as he constantly battled for points and podiums. This eventually culminated in him becoming the youngest driver in Clio Cup history to qualify on pole position at the Brands Hatch season finale.  Under the watchful eye of mentor, triple British Touring Car Championship champion Colin Turkington, Jack then went on to win the International Clio Cup Final held at Paul Ricard. Beating ninety drivers from other Clio Cup series around the globe.  With encouraging results in his half year in the championship and victory at Paul Ricard, Jack is aiming big for the 2019 season and believes he could be in contention for overall honours. If he does win the title, he will become the youngest ever UK Clio Cup champion beating the record previously set by Tom Onslow-Cole in 2006.  Commenting on his return for 2019. Jack said, “I’m delighted to be back – the target is a career in touring cars and the Clio Cup is the closest you can get to that type of racing before stepping up.  “I’m sure we have a strong chance of wins and of course the title is the aim, but I know it is going to be tough against some of the names who I know are going to be announced soon. It’s a challenge I relish!”  MRM Team Principal Mike Ritchie spoke of the journey the squad and Jack have had so far on the touring car ladder, “We’re very proud with how we have helped bring him on,  “from winning the Clio Cup Junior title together in 2017 to being able to go into the senior Clio Cup in 2019 as championship contenders. We’re all looking forward to a very exciting year with him.”<|im_end|>

# Everton transfer news: Toffees scout reveals who he is watching but adds damning statement

Everton are in for a quiet January transfer window with manager Marco Silva admitting he has limited funds at his disposal. But that does not mean they have stopped looking for players who can improve their squad in the future. Former footballer Jacomuzzi is based out in Italy and Everton’s utilise him to check up on potential targets who ply their trade in Serie A. Jacomuzzi has now revealed he was sent to watch Napoli’s 2-1 win over Lazio at the Stadio San Paolo on Sunday. But it’s safe to say he doesn’t hold out much hope of Everton being able to snare any of Carlo Ancelotti’s men. "The contest between Napoli and Lazio?" Jacomuzzi told Italian station Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli. "At one point I thought I was wrong because I did not think there were non-attendances in Napoli. "There are many games in Italy during which I fall asleep. "For example, I went to see Inter [Milan] - Sassuolo and did not know what to write in the report for Everton. "Yesterday I had fun. Seeing [Jose] Callejon is always a pleasure, but also Mario Rui has made a great match for intensity. "[Amadou] Diawara? I wrote that there are many valid players but Everton does not make the Champions League, so why should a player move from Napoli to come to us?" Everton’s lack of January spending comes after they made waves last summer as the likes of Yerry Mina, Lucas Digne and Richarlison arrived at Goodison Park. Silva, though, is confident his current crop can end their run of inconsistency as they seek to finish the season in the top 10. "It is something I am telling the players [the belief I have in them] and the good things we have done," Silva said. "Even if we have a tough period, we do not forget the really good things we have done. "We had a lot of changes at the start of the season. We brought in six new players and we wanted to gel as fast as we can. "In football, sometimes you don’t have the time because you have to win the next game and show your quality. "I always want more from my team but I know the very good things we have done this season."<|im_end|>

# Bird and Lime face legal backlash from disabled | AndroidPIT

Are carelessly parked scooters a pain in the ass? Quite possibly, especially if you're a disabled person in San Diego. A disability rights group has sued the City of San Diego and three companies including popular e-scooter sharing platforms Bird and Lime.  The new proposed class-action lawsuit, Montoya et al v. City of San Diego, alleges that the city authority and e-scooter startups violate the Americans with Disabilities Act and other state laws relating to disabilities and accessibility. Disability Rights California claims that e-scooter companies are making the city sidewalks dangerous for people with physical disabilities by cluttering the sidewalks with carelessly placed scooters. The geo-fencing created by the companies doesn't take into account the potential danger to the disabled. As for the City of San Diego et al, the urban authorities have made the problem worse by neglecting to keep the sidewalks and roads clear of obstacles. The civil complaint, filed on January 9, goes on to state that: "Scooter Defendants hinder and inhibit Plaintiffs from using the system of sidewalks, crosswalks, transit stops, curb ramps, pedestrian crossings and other walkways, and have actually caused Plaintiffs to use the sidewalks less often." If the lawsuit succeeds, it could lead to scooters being banned from San Diego’s sidewalks, curbs, transit stops, and other potentially hazardous locations. San Diego is a testing ground We're still in the Wild West period of e-scooters and ridesharing, in which startups like Lime and Bird offer convenience a low cost to their users but appear to skirt responsibility. Technically a user of these services signs up to policies such as wearing a helmet and not blocking public walkways, but it's hard to prevent abuse in practice and the startups don't seem in such a hurry to step in. Naturally companies like Lime and Bird want to expand their services as much as possible, but who takes responsibility for potential risks, and safeguarding of disability access in public spaces? No doubt companies will try to shoulder as little of this responsibility as possible, whereas city officials will have to do their part and pressure scooter companies to be more civic-minded and pull their weight. Disrupting the transport market is one thing, but disrupting public accessibility can put lives at risk. The Bay Area is the proving ground for a young industry that's pushing the boundaries to see how public opinion forms and social norms develop. Lawsuits such as Montoya et al v. City of San Diego join similar legal efforts in Los Angeles, Denver and San Francisco attempting to curb the reckless growth of e-scooter companies for public safety and environmental reasons. Are have e-scooters taken over your city? Are they a convenience or a nuisance in your opinion?  Source: Disability Rights CA<|im_end|>

# The Family Dog Would Like Some Firm Rules On What Can and Cannot Be Humped

It has been a good day. But, that is not why I want to talk to you. I wanted to talk to you about my sexuality. Now, when I was but an innocent puppy, you decided not to cut off my testicles. That was tremendously kind of you, I really do appreciate it. The other dogs get jealous, other humans at the park point at my impressive “low hanging fruit,” the female dogs in the neighborhood go crazy at the sight of me. It’s awesome. Unfortunately, as you know, I want to rub my penis on everything in sight. I’m like 85% of men in show business: I’m a monster. Comedy clubs in New York keep offering me sets. It’s a real problem. I am a dog. I cannot do stand up. I am getting sidetracked, but I guess that is common with dogs. My point is I am very horny. Now, we all know that you get very angry when I hump most things. I have noticed, however, that I do not get yelled at when I hump certain things. When I hump your leg or a lamp, you yell at me. That I understand. Boundaries are good. Your leg and lamp are off limits. Plus, the lamp is too skinny to get any purchase on anyways. The time I pinned down your toddler nephew and humped him. That got me kicked. I understand completely. You explained pedophilia to me. He’s 3. I’m also 3, just multiplied by 7. It’s just not meant to be. I’m sorry I made him cry and also that you had to wash his shirt after that incident. So, it seems the first rule is not to hump things that belong to you. The leg belongs to you. The lamp also belongs to you. The child belongs to you I think, though I am not entirely sure how children work. Howeve—that fucking squirrel is back! I see you bitch! Get the fuck off my fucking lawn! I will rip out your internal organs and hump your lifeless corpse you worthless sack of shit! That’s right, you better run. Sorry. You know me. Got to protect you and the house. Anyway— There are certain things where the line just is not as clear. When I hump your girlfriend’s leg for instance. You laugh at first but then you tell me to get off. Is it funny and okay? Or do you want me not to do it? You need to be clearer. Also, you’re allowed to hump her. Why can’t I? I thought we were bros. Does she fall under the first rule of things that belong to you? That's a slightly outdated viewpoint you have there. She's her own person. I should be able to hump her if she consents. Or is it like your nephew, in that humping humans makes them uncomfortable? Should another rule don't hump humans? Also, there’s my favorite toy. You call him Mr. Camel. I call him Mr. Humps. Every time I hump him you say it’s cute because you think it means I love him (it is purely physical, grow up). But, when I finish on Mr. Humps, you yell at me and take him away for a while. He comes back all clean, but it feels like a punishment. What am I supposed to do? Not finish? I’ll get blue balls. I suppose if it is what you really want though, I'll do it for you. So, we agree, I can hump things that belong to me, I just have to prevent myself from finishing on them? Weird rule, especially coming from you. I see what you do to that sock under your mattress. But, if that's the next rule, I guess I can live with it. Lastly there is your single aunt, Laurel. You told me to get off when I humped her before dinner. But then later, when it was just me and Laurel, I did my thing again. I made my moves. I wooed her. I humped the shit out of her shin. No one told me to get off. Laurel just said it was nice to feel needed. So, is your aunt’s shin off limits or not? Are humans a no-go for this dog's bone or not? Should we add a subsection to the “no humans” rule that if they are also into it I can hump them? You gotta set some firm rules, man. To help us both. I don’t want to hump what you don’t want me to, because I respect you, but a dog needs something to rub his genitals against, or he’ll go crazy. List submissions are now accepted.

# FOLSE FACTS: An idea whose time has come

So, I’m sitting in the press box at Titan Coliseum on Jan. 4 covering the Northshore High-St. Scholastica girls soccer match, (SSA won 2-0, congratulations to the Doves) and I found myself asking the same question repeatedly. Why am I here? Northshore is based in Slidell, and St. Scholastica is in Covington, but we are in Mandeville on the Lakeshore High campus. Why we were at Lakeshore is obvious, as St. Tammany Parish hasn’t had its fair share of luck with good soccer-playing weather to start the season. Panther Stadium at Northshore was a mud fest, forcing Northshore school officials to have to move the match to Mandeville, where there is turf. But what if we didn’t have to move matches anymore? It got me to thinking. The St. Tammany Parish School Board recently approved $175 million in capital improvement bonds, which will go to the voters for approval on May 4. The $175 million will be used for capital improvements for the parish’s public schools that range from money for school resource officers to new buildings. There are eight high schools run by the STPSB (Covington, Fontainebleau, Lakeshore, Mandeville, Northshore, Pearl River, Salmen and Slidell). With Lakeshore High being the youngest of the group at 10 years old, it is the only school that has turf on its football field. Increasing this number is long overdue. I can just hear people saying as they're reading this that football gets everything already, why should it get more. This is not just about football on the prep level. Granted, the sport costs the most to run, but let us not forget that it brings in the most revenue for the athletic departments of the schools. However, turfing the remaining seven public schools (for the record, St. Paul’s and Northlake Christian also have turf, while Archbishop Hannan and Pope John Paul II do not), is a smart move. High school football teams are not the only ones that would be affected. Most of the parish’s junior high programs play their football games on high school campuses, and many saw games canceled because of poor field conditions. Boys and girls soccer also play on the football fields, and in the case of Mandeville High, that is also the location of their lacrosse team’s games. Not to mention all the other ways turf fields could be used for band practices, dance team and cheerleading, baseball and softball when their facilities are unable to be used. We are talking about hundreds of kids throughout the parish. Also, having turf fields, whether you like it or not, attracts kids. For quite some time, St. Tammany Parish has been losing kids to the south shore for high school. Federal and state funding is largely based on the number of children in schools. Am I saying that this is going to lead to a dramatic increase? No, but it won’t hurt things. Also, let’s not forget the other events that could be drawn to the remaining seven schools should turf be installed. Recreational tournaments regardless of the sport and regardless of the age are big business, and the summers could be filled with them (for a small hosting fee, of course). The other thing that we don’t think about is everyone thinks, "Ooh our field is bad, we will just move the game to Lakeshore." When you talk to many people associated with the different sports on the Lakeshore campus, they will tell you they rarely get any practice time because everyone is always using their field and their facility. How is that fair? The best estimates I could find on turf fields are around $1 million apiece. Do we not think if School Board officials went to a company and offered them a contract for the seven remaining schools that the price would come down? And remember, that price tag could be spread out over 10 years. We all know about the weather in south Louisiana; it isn’t always the best in the world. But it is 2019, people. We should not be having high school teams in this parish and the kids in this parish missing out on extracurricular activities or having to move 20-30 miles away at times because this parish lacks the proper facilities to host them. I spoke with School Board representative Stephen J. “Jack” Loup III to get some reaction to the case I was making. He said while turfing the remaining football fields in the parish is something that deserves to be looked at, the top priority of the bond issue was to get the students of the parish out of the modular buildings and into modern classrooms, in addition to enhancing school security across the parish. So, should this happen? Absolutely. Will it happen? That’s an entirely different story. Sports Editor David Folse II can be reached via email at dfolse@sttammanyfarmer.net<|im_end|>

# Sydney psychic Pam Bradbury selling up on Scotland Island

Sydney psychic Pam Bradbury never expected to fall quite so deeply in love with the waterfront home she and husband Colin found on the shores of Scotland Island some 15 years ago.  They envisaged a few years of lapping up the idyllic island lifestyle — a world away from their previous home in Melbourne — which they would share with their children and grandchildren.  And somehow, 15 years slipped by.  “I can’t believe the time has gone so quickly,” Ms Bradbury said.  “It’s been such a wonderful experience, being so close to nature, and being part of such an amazing island community.  “You’re never alone there — there’s always something going on and plenty of people around. It’s a very special place.”        With their grandchildren now growing up, the couple are keen to spend more time living on their beloved 40ft Hanse yacht, the Hakuna Matata, which is conveniently berthed at the end of the jetty outside their home, at 123 Florence Terrace, Scotland Island.  “We are going to go where the wind takes us,” she said.  But not just yet. First they have to sell their beloved home. It’s been a bittersweet decision for the psychic and medium, who has worked with her gift for more than 30 years, as an author, and presenter and psychic on radio and television talkback shows.  “We’ve loved it, we really don’t want to go, but it’s time,” she said.        The three-bedroom home sits on a 817sqm block and has been meticulously renovated and maintained over the years she and her husband have owned it.  Sam Thompson, of McGrath Avalon, said it was a standout property on the island, and with a price guide of $2,200,000-$2,400,000, represented excellent value.  “It’s only five minutes to the mainland and has a deep waterfront that can take up to 50ft (boat or yacht),” he said. “I think it’s really, really good buying.”  The home has a prized northeast aspect and 180-degree views across Pittwater, and a design that embraces the relaxed island lifestyle.  A multi-level design, connects indoor and outdoor spaces with natural sunlit rooms, all with breathtaking views.  Features include a deepwater jetty, swimming pontoon and mooring, private sandy beach with boathouse/studio/fourth bedroom, lounge room flowing out to waterside deck, kitchen with Miele stainless electrical appliances, polished timber floors, cathedral ceilings and wood burning stove, main bedroom with ensuite and private balcony, uniquely designed second bedroom with study and loft library, lower level workshop with ample storage, landscaped terraced gardens and multiple outdoor living areas, and secure child/pet play area in fenced rear garden.  The house is for sale by private treaty, through Sam Thompson, of McGrath Avalon.<|im_end|>

# Les Jardins Dorval shopping centre has been sold

Mayor Edgar Rouleau would like to the land turned into a mixed-use development.  Les Jardins Dorval shopping centre has been sold to the North America Development Group. Glenn Munro, speaking for NADG Montreal, said the purchase of the 95,078 square metre property was finalized last week, but would not comment further at this early stage in the planning process. Mayor Edgar Rouleau told the West Island Gazette that Dorval’s director of urban planning Mario St-Jean will be meeting with NADG in the coming weeks to discuss in more detail what the city’s vision is for the property. The purchase includes the shopping mall and the parking lot located in the southern portion of the property. “(NADG) knows we would like it to be mixed used — residential and commercial,” Rouleau said. “You see it more and more in the United States. For seniors it would be great. Look at the winter we are having. Seniors don’t want to go out to do their shopping.” The zoning is already in place for a mix-use project. On its website, NADG is described as “active in the development, acquisition, redevelopment and management of over 200 shopping centres, mixed-use and residential developments comprising well over 35 million square feet across Canada and the United States.” NADG’s Quebec presence includes commercial entities in Boucherville, Laval, Boisbriand and Rouyn Noranda. NADG mixed-used projects can be found in Kelowna, B.C. and Lake Mary and Daytona Beach, Florida. Rouleau said the Montreal Agglomeration Council’s Land Use and Development Plan encourages municipalities to densify, but that Dorval’s housing stock is primarily of the single-family home variety and there is very little vacant land available to develop. “So when we have an opportunity like (the shopping centre sale) it’s good for us,” Rouleau said. “The property has already been identified as a TOD (transit-oriented development).” TODs are developments located within one kilometre of a transit hub. Via Rail, a major bus terminal and the international airport are all located within the vicinity. Because of the proximity to the airport, there will be height restrictions for the build. Rouleau speculated that peak height could be between 8 and 10 storeys for an office or residential building. Transport Canada enforces the height restrictions, but was unable to supply the information requested by deadline. Les Jardins Dorval first opened in 1954 and was considered the benchmark for shopping malls at the time, but its popularity had begun to slip over the last years. Rouleau said previous owner Strathallen Capital Corp. did a good job of upgrading the interior to make it an attractive location to shop, but that customer traffic continued to dwindle. “Stores began to close and it no longer had the variety it once had,” the mayor said. “And people are shopping online more and more. You always need to buy a quart of milk and get your hair cut, so the (grocery store) and hair dresser are busy. But when it comes to jewelry or clothing stores, it’s tough.” Today, the anchor stores at the mall are The Bay, Maxi and Walmart which replaced a Zellers outlet almost seven years ago.<|im_end|>

# B.C. has lost millions to undervalued commercial properties, former assessor says

Recently retired BC Assessment assessor Derek Holloway says that for too long, large commercial properties, often slated for residential density, were being undervalued and money was left on the table. That’s money that could have been going toward funding social housing and affordable housing models, such as co-op housing.  When big properties aren’t taxed correctly, he says, residential property owners take on the extra tax burden.  But Mr. Holloway says municipalities have done enough on the housing front, and it’s past provincial governments that must be held accountable. He blames policies that saw government stepping away from housing programs, selling off public lands to private developers, and failing to ensure trophy properties were valued and taxed according to the market. Mr. Holloway says that anyone concerned with the creation of affordable housing should consider this overlooked source of lost funding.  “I don’t know of any housing advocates who have taken issue with low assessments, since the process is so insulated,” says Mr. Holloway, who was a senior appraiser at BC Assessment for 28 years. Prior to that, he was an appraiser for seven years at Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, where he helped deliver co-op and non-profit housing throughout the Lower Mainland.  “My hope is that the provincial and federal governments move forward with a new housing plan and, in addition, perhaps properly fund BCA and amend the legislation so they can be more effective.  “Cities have given enough – the province needs to step up. Housing is their charter mandate.”  Mr. Holloway specialized in valuating high-profile properties in the category of industrial, commercial and investment properties [ICI], and was one of two specialists that dealt with the Appeal Board. The vast majority of appeals are properties that fall into the industrial, commercial and investment category, he says. Mr. Holloway says he dealt with tax agents hired by large pension plans and developers, who sought to appeal and lower an assessment “whether it had merit or not.”  He credits BCA staff for doing the best with the funding they have. But nearing the end of his job, he became increasingly frustrated with the process that allowed big-parcel property owners and their representatives to routinely appeal for lower assessments, thereby jamming up the system and forcing the underfunded agency to accept lower assessments. He blames lack of funding and ineffective, toothless legislation for the gap. The agency, he says, is doing a proper job of assessing residential properties, which is a fairly straightforward process. An independent data analyst with knowledge of BCA’s procedures said, off the record, that with current AI technology, Vancouver homes could be assessed with a fraction of the number of staff that currently work at BCA – which would be one way to streamline and redirect funding toward properly completing the more difficult assessments. Those were the kinds of properties that Mr. Holloway worked on, and they usually don’t have comparables because they are unique. They take a certain amount of skill and the legal ability to acquire documentation – and that documentation is not currently within the BCA’s grasp, says Mr. Holloway.  The former provincially owned Little Mountain property, for example, may have been under-assessed due to a lack of transparency, he says. The province sold it to a developer in 2007 as part of a secret deal, receiving payments in future installments.  “I’ll bet that BC Assessment has never seen the sale agreement,” says Mr. Holloway.  The value did increase in 2016 after rezoning was completed, to $101-million. Assessments then went to $205-million in 2017, to $362-million in 2018, to $398-million in 2019, he says.  “BCA is guilty of what is commonly called in the business as ‘sale chasing,’” says Mr. Holloway. “They weren’t at appropriate values for too many years and then they play massive catch-up.”  He’s especially critical of the BC Liberals' handling of Little Mountain, which was one of Canada’s largest low-income housing projects.  “BC Housing could have just held onto the site and then subdivided off individual lots over 10 years, reaping the windfall for B.C. taxpayers that is reflected in the higher assessments.  “I never understand why past B.C. governments don’t hire someone to do all the preliminary subdivision, servicing and zoning work and get the massive uplift in value, instead of selling to an offshore buyer at a discount.  “Past provincial governments have not only screwed taxing jurisdictions by perennially under-assessing trophy properties – they’ve handed over massive amounts of prime real estate to developers, all whilst ignoring B.C.’s needs for affordable housing.”  Mr. Holloway cites several examples of large properties that were valued at significantly smaller amounts than the prices for which they sold. In Vancouver, a building at 1200 Burrard St. was assessed at $41.3-million and sold for $63.8-million in 2017. An odd-shaped lot at 398 Kingsway at 12th Avenue was assessed at $14.1-million and sold for $26.5-million in 2018. The property at 2460 Commercial Dr. was assessed at $14.6-million and sold for $36-million in 2017. That same year, the White Spot site on Georgia Street reportedly sold for $245-million, but had been assessed at $167-million.  Residential property assessments rarely see such gaps.  When Mr. Holloway was retiring from BCA two years ago, the Oakridge property came under review. In 2016, after an appeal on the 2015 value, BCA assessed it at $550.3-million. In 2014, the city had agreed to 3,000 condo units at the site, which is near the Canada Line, making it a valuable property. Talk of redevelopment had been going on for a decade.  But the value of Oakridge Centre, at 650 W. 41st Ave., only made a drastic jump between 2016 and 2019 assessments, doubling its assessed value. Media reported an undisclosed sale of $961-million. There is no way to confirm the sale because there is no record of it, which is often the case with large trophy properties. That’s another problem, says Mr. Holloway – legislation is so ineffective that sophisticated tax agents can easily dodge requests to submit bank appraisals or sales agreements. He says he would ask, but he often never saw the documentation.  “It could be that if over the years these properties had been assessed properly, that they would have more money in the kitty,” says Mr. Holloway. “And it just seems to me that some of these biggest players, big developers, that sort of thing, they are finding ways to hide behind their appeal agent and keeping values down and playing the game with BCA, and it undermines the whole process.”  BC Assessment spokesperson Tina Ireland, however, responds that the Authority meets an international standard. She says they look at “market evidence” to determine the value.  “While some properties may be more challenging than others, we do have the appropriate inventory and sources of data, which our professional appraisers use to determine assessed values on all properties,” Ms. Ireland says.  Tax agent Paul Sullivan represented the former owner of Oakridge Centre, as senior partner at consulting firm Burgess, Cawley, Sullivan and Associates. He argues that the value of Oakridge at the time was in line with the market in July, 2015. He also challenges the assertion that residential owners would bear the brunt of lost commercial taxes, because tax levies for each classification of property are decided at the municipal level. Oakridge fell entirely within commercial.  “There was a rapid increase in land value from 2015 through 2017 throughout Metro Vancouver,” he says of Oakridge.  Mr. Sullivan argues that two forces impacted the value of Oakridge: increased demand and market price increase, as well as rezoning and government policy change (which allowed for significant density increase).  Mr. Holloway says that when commercial properties are routinely under-assessed, over time, the municipality feels the pressure to shift the tax burden to other property classes, primarily residential.  “If large ICI properties were properly assessed, no need for shifts.”  Ms. Ireland says she can’t speak to specific property assessments, but she says assessments reflect the values as of July 1 each year, in order to ensure fairness and uniformity.  “Market value is defined as the most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, with a willing buyer and a willing seller and without undue stimulus,” she says. “There could be many reasons why assessments differ from reported sale prices – for example, it may not be a market-value sale. There may be considerations other than land and improvements in the sale price. Market conditions may have changed since the date of July 1.”  Mark Goodman is a principal at the Goodman Report, which markets and advises sellers on multi-family buildings. The company acts as expert witnesses in appeal cases, and gives advice. They recently helped a co-op building get a $4-million adjustment. He responds that commercial properties may have been undervalued for many years, but it’s a new day, and a rockier one, for large-property owners.  “There was a period of time when we were selling buildings over twice what the assessment was, but then it caught up a few years ago to market value,” says Mr. Goodman.  “This is the first time ever in the 17 years I’ve been practising real estate where the assessed values of buildings are, in most cases, over the market value.”  But with new regulations and municipal policies, the landlord-owner now can’t realize the development potential of a property, which puts them in a negative cash-flow situation, he says.  “It just seems to me, the pendulum has swung the other way and it’s causing havoc in this industry.”<|im_end|>

# Tory MPs plot how to dock John Bercow's salary or pension in revenge for selecting Grieve amendment

Conservative MPs are drawing up motions demanding John Bercow faces pay cut and lose some of his gold-plated pension in revenge for selecting Dominic Grieve's Brexit amendment.  The House of Commons speaker faced a backlash from after selecting a proposal from Mr Grieve, which attempts to speed up the process for the Government to reveal what it will do next if Theresa May's deal is rejected.  Mr Grieve's amendment was tabled against a Government motion detailing the timetable for the Brexit deal debate, which Tory MPs argued was "unamendable".  Labour whips were surprised with one source saying that they had considered Mr Grieve's amendment to be "unamendable".  Justice minister Rory Stewart added...

# Idaho State football player alleges racist messages, physical abuse from coaching staff

POCATELLO — Idaho State University is investigating complaints from a football player that allege “inappropriate communication from a coach, a lack of playing time, an alleged assault by a coach during an away game, and the student-athlete being incorrectly informed about his eligibility status,” the school said in a news release Tuesday night. The complaint, filed on Nov. 14, 2018, is in regards to safety Jayson Miller, the Idaho State Journal reported. According to the ISU release, a coach sent the player text messages in late September or early October that included “derogatory ... race and gender-based themes.” The coach, identified by Miller in the State Journal story as assistant Jay Staggs, was removed from his position after a school investigation found “wrongdoing by the coach.” “When Idaho State University learned about the inappropriate text messages to players, we took immediate and swift action. Conduct of this nature is absolutely unacceptable,” interim athletic director Pauline Thiros said in the statement. “We aim to provide an environment based on the values of equity, inclusion, and respect for all people. We will not stand for actions that belittle or are disrespectful.” The second incident outlined in the complaint involves a coach “hammer punching” Miller on the shoulder pads during halftime of a game at Cal-Poly in San Luis Obispo. Miller told the State Journal that the person in question was head coach Rob Phenicie. Miller told the State Journal that Phenicie hit him a second time after asking him to stop, and that the “hammer punches” caused bruising. Phenicie has not been placed on administrative leave, according to the State Journal. “Idaho State University takes all allegations of physical assault extremely seriously,” Idaho State University President Kevin Satterlee said in the statement. “The experience of our student-athletes is important to us. When our university receives a complaint, we will have the matter thoroughly investigated. Based on the investigation findings we will always take the right and appropriate action to ensure that we create an environment that is safe and supportive. ... We will continue to work through the investigative process with that outcome in mind.” The school, which said it hoped to wrap up the investigation within 90 days, also acknowledged that it did not properly handle Miller’s eligibility. Miller, who missed all but one game in 2017 with an injury, was told that he would receive another year of eligibility, according to the State Journal. The school did not file the proper paperwork, however, and Miller was then told that the 2018 season was his last. “It’s apparent that our department failed to follow proper protocol regarding eligibility for the student-athlete, and we created a clear expectation for him that he would have an additional year,” Thiros said. “For that, we apologize and are doing all we can to pursue that year of eligibility for him now. Whatever the outcome, we will honor our scholarship commitment.” Miller is not the first player to accuse an Idaho State football coach of physical abuse. Mike Kramer, Phenicie’s predecesor, pushed wide receiver Derek Graves to the ground during a 2012 practice with such force that Graves said he injured his neck. ESPN’s “Outside the Lines” aired the footage on national television. Idaho State suspended Kramer for one game and the Pocatello Police Department investigated, but prosecutors didn’t pursue charges. Kramer continued to coach the Bengals until the school fired him after the 2016 season. Phenicie took over the program in 2017, leading Idaho State to a 4-7 record and earning a three-year contract extension. The Bengals went 6-5 last fall, including 5-3 in the Big Sky, for their second winning season in the past 15 years. Miller will attempt to file criminal charges against Phenicie, the State Journal reported.<|im_end|>

# Marilyn Sevilla: a remembrance | Faulkner

Check out an aerial view of snow in downtown Reno and Virginia City on Jan. 8, 2019. The most recent rounds of storms dropped 4 inches to 8 inches of snow in Reno. Sam Gross and Benjamin Spillman, Reno Gazette Journal It was the beautiful golden curls you noticed first. You couldn’t miss them up on stage when you walked into the concert hall or showroom. But Marilyn Sevilla’s stunning hair was well down on the list of what made her such a distinctive and important part of our community. On Dec. 1, 2018 she passed away. Marilyn’s was a life of love. Born in Oakland, California on April 11, 1932, she fell in love with the violin at age 5, convincing her grandfather to purchase a tin violin at local five-and-dime. It quickly became apparent that she possessed real talent, and at age 14 she won an audition with the Oakland Symphony. After high school, she earned a full scholarship to the University of Pacific, graduating with high honors. After college, she taught music for a time in the San Carlos, California school district. Reno bassist Nancy Hoffman was a student in her class, neither knowing at the time that the two would play together professionally for decades. Marilyn married the love of her life, Fidel Sevilla, in 1970. Understanding the economic realities of pursuing performance careers in classical music at the time, the two of them moved to South Lake Tahoe to perform in the house orchestra at Harrah’s. Shortly thereafter they relocated “down the hill,” anchoring the orchestra in the Headliner Room at Harrah’s Reno for years. This was the heyday of the Reno showrooms, and Marilyn performed with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr. and countless others. The list of stars she didn’t play with might be shorter than the one with whom she did. Her love of classical music led Marilyn and a handful of other Harrah’s colleagues to form the Reno Chamber Orchestra in 1974. Over the orchestra’s history she served often in the concertmaster role, and whatever chair she occupied, Marilyn was always a leader. Now in its 45th season, the RCO simply would not exist today if it weren’t for Marilyn Sevilla. Upon her retirement from the Orchestra in 2014, the RCO board bestowed upon her the title “violinist emerita.” Marilyn’s impact on the Reno Phil is similar. For most of the orchestra’s 50 years she was a Rock of Gibraltar — musically and personally — to those of us who played with her. In this orchestra, too, she often served as concertmaster. It is notable and wonderful that women, specifically Marilyn Sevilla and Ruth Lenz (not to mention Maestro Laura Jackson), have held the top musical leadership position in our orchestras. These women have led with a confidence and competence that have made their gender an absolute nonissue. Marilyn’s trailblazing role in establishing this norm in our community should not be underestimated. Her love of the violin and of making music compelled her to play as long as she possibly could, finally stopping for good just two years ago, at the age of 84. Even at that time, she was a contributing member of the orchestra. In 2017 Marilyn was inducted into the Nevada Music Hall of Fame. In addition to the thousands of performances she played in Reno, for decades Marilyn spent part of her summers playing in the prestigious Carmel Bach Festival Orchestra. She was a founding member of Holy Cross Lutheran Church, a fierce Words with Friends competitor (something I know personally, having suffered many defeats at her hand) and a devoted mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. Whether family, friend, fellow musician or audience member, we are all fortunate for the love of music, love of people, and love of our community that Marilyn Sevilla brought to us. Rest in peace, Marilyn. More from Scott Faulkner: Two books for lovers of Reno, music and history More from Scott Faulkner: 13 essentials for arts leaders in the 21st century Scott Faulkner is principal bassist of the Reno Phil and Reno Chamber Orchestra. He had the honor of playing music with Marilyn Sevilla for nearly 25 years.<|im_end|>

# Number four through the door! Lincoln City sign Ipswich winger

Lincoln City have announced another impressive signing with the capture of Ipswich Town winger Jordan Roberts.  The 26-year-old left-sided player has joined the Imps on loan for the rest of the season and becomes Danny Cowley’s fourth signing of the January transfer window, following the arrival of Cian Bolger, James Brown and another Ipswich man, Danny Rowe.  Roberts began his career at Aldershot Town before a spell in Scotland with Inverness before returning to England with Crawley Town.  He enjoyed two impressive seasons with Sussex club which led to then Ipswich manager Paul Hurst taking him to Portman Road last summer.  However, he has made just 12 appearances for the Tractor Boys, who sacked Hurst earlier this season and replaced them with Paul Lambert.  The Imps are believed to have faced stiff competition to sign Roberts, who was also reportedly wanted by Bradford City, Plymouth and MK Dons.  However, Cowley has won the race to sign Roberts, who is poised to go straight into the squad for Saturday’s top-of-the-table clash at Bury.  The Imps boss has not finished his January shopping and wants to add another striker to his squad the transfer window slams shut next Thursday night.<|im_end|>

# Patisserie Valerie announces Scottish store closures

Patisserie Valerie has announced which Scottish stores are among 71 shops that have closed.  Administrator KPMG confirmed 71 stores across the UK will close resulting in 920 redundancies.  In Scotland, four of the fourteen Scottish outlets have closed so far including the Glasgow Fort and Glasgow Royal Exchange stores.  The concessions at Debenhams in Edinburgh and Glasgow will also be closed.  In total across the UK, 27 standalone stores, 19 Druckers outlets and 25 Patisserie Valerie concessions in Debenhams, Next and at motorway service areas have already been hit by closures.  The remaining 122 outlets will continue to trade while the administrators seek a buyer for the business.  The firm said discussions with its lenders HSBC and Barclays to extend a standstill agreement on its debts had come to nothing, leaving it with no option but to appoint KPMG as administrator.  Its parent company Patisserie Holdings has been grappling with the fallout of an accounting fraud.  It said on Tuesday evening: "Patisserie Holdings plc announces today that, as a direct result of the significant fraud referred to in previous announcements, it has been unable to renew its bank facilities, and therefore regrettably the business does not have sufficient funding to meet its liabilities as they fall due."  List of closed Patisserie Valerie outlets in Scotland  Edinburgh Debenhams - 109 Princes Street  Glasgow Debenhams - 97 Argyle Street  Glasgow - B12 Glasgow Fort  Glasgow - 18-20 Royal Exchange Square  Chairman Luke Johnson has extended an unsecured, interest-free loan to help ensure that the January wages are paid to all staff working in the ongoing business, the company added.  The loan will also assist the administrators in trading as many profitable stores as possible while a sale process is undertaken.  Last week, Patisserie revealed KPMG had been hired to carry out a review of all options following the accounting scandal which pushed it close to collapse last year.  It also unveiled the "devastating" extent of irregularities in its books, which included thousands of false entries into the company's ledgers.  The firm said an initial investigation pointed to cashflow and profitability being worse than previously thought when the problem was first discovered in October.  The discovery of a black hole in the company's accounts in October last year pushed it into a crisis which saw it almost cease trading.  A rescue plan was passed by shareholders in November, resulting in the issue of £15 million worth of new shares.<|im_end|>

# Met Office: 'Hints another Beast from the East is brewing'

The Met Office says more cold weather is on its way - and it's possible things could turn 'very cold' in Devon and Cornwall by mid February.  Alex Burkill, a meteorologist at the Met Office in Exeter, said the next few days are set to be milder than they have been, but temperatures are likely to fall by the beginning of next week, bringing a risk of more snow to the region.  "In the shorter range, there is milder air coming from the east - but by Sunday it's going to start getting colder again. This brings with it a risk of ice, and sleet or snow.  "It does look like it will stay cold and, and by mid February it could possibly become very cold at times - but it's too early to give any detail about where and when.  "Devon and Cornwall are milder, so even if some areas of the country are likely to get snow, it's generally less likely here.  There have been national reports of forecasts that snow will blanket the UK for two weeks, and Alex said there are some signs that a similar weather system to the one that caused last year's Beast from East - which brought significant snow falls to Devon and Cornwall - could be developing.  "Last year's very cold weather was caused by a cold easterly flow," said Alex. "There are hints that something similar could develop. At the moment it's a low probability, but there is the potential for it to become very cold by the middle of February."  Facebook weather forecasters UK Southwest Storm Chasers predicts that parts of Devon could see snow as early as next week - but say "no Beast from the East... is expected anytime soon".  "From the start of next week, things get a little interesting as we keep to the north of the Jet Stream, meaning we stay in the cold side of the Jet. This also means the next cold snap will last longer than we saw recently.  "There's nothing unusual for this time of year to see this happen and to see such cold conditions and single figures regarding temperatures.  "We are also expecting areas of Low Pressure to affect us from the west, again nothing unusual for the winter months.  "What is showing on data models at present is that we will see a mixture of rain, sleet and even snow especially across the moors and anywhere above an average of 150ft as these Atlantic systems push through.  "There are signs that parts of central, northeast Devon running up into parts of Somerset, could see some snow but again the detail is a little uncertain at present and massively open to change.  "There are NO signs of an easterly wind throughout the next 5 to 8 days so a big snow event is unlikely and before the press get carried away, NO Beast from the East part 6001 is expected anytime soon."  The Met Office Weather Outlook for the UK over the next 6-30 days  UK Outlook for Monday 28 Jan 2019 to Wednesday 6 Feb 2019:  Cold and showery conditions are likely at first on Monday, ahead of thicker cloud and rain, perhaps preceded by snow, which is expected to move eastwards later in the day. Cold and showery weather will probably make a return on Tuesday. Beyond there, the broad signal is for the unsettled period of the weather to continue, with further bands of rain and hill snow moving east or southeast across the UK, interspersed with brighter showery interludes. Snow remains a risk, mostly in the north, but perhaps further south too, and frosts could be quite widespread. There is still a chance that even colder conditions may develop later in the period with winds swinging round to the east or northeast, bringing an increased possibility of snow.  UK Outlook for Thursday 7 Feb 2019 to Thursday 21 Feb 2019:  This period will most likely start changeable and cold, with spells of rain and hill snow, occasional stronger winds, and brighter showery interludes. As we head further through February there is an increased chance of seeing very cold conditions developing with a greater probability of northeasterly or easterly winds. This will bring an increased risk of widespread, perhaps severe frosts as well as snow, especially in eastern areas. In this scenario the driest conditions will be across the west and northwest, whilst the south could see wetter and occasionally milder spells, bringing the risk of some significant snow, but only if very cold air becomes established across much of the UK.

# Funding review causing budget guesswork

No-strings-attached provincial transfers, used to buffer budget books in smaller municipalities with shrinking or stalled population growth, are being held for review by Ontario’s government, leading to some blind budgeting. Sarnia, for instance, is going into Jan. 15 budget talks with a draft $745,000 cut to operating budget revenue, said Finance Director Lisa Armstrong. That’s a 30-per-cent scaling back of the money that was expected through the Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund (OMPF), she said. “I have nothing to go on at this point, so that’s just honestly a guess,” she said. The amount is usually confirmed in November, Armstrong said, but this year the Progressive Conservative government announced, in a letter from Finance Minister Vic Fedeli in December, the OMPF and all transfer payments to municipalities are under review as the government tries to rein in spending. “While we all will be operating within a smaller funding envelope, we want to work with you to return the program to what it was initially intended to do – support the Northern and rural municipalities that need it the most,” Fedeli’s letter to municipalities reads. Sarnia has been receiving about $2.5 million through the fund, Armstrong said. Other communities have seen decreases. However off the guesswork is for the expected reduction will be reflected in the coming year’s surplus or deficit, Armstrong said. In Strathroy-Caradoc, meanwhile, the delay also affects budgeting, but isn’t as significant, said Finance Director Bill Daikin. “We’ve sort of weened ourselves off (OMPF), so it’s really sort of a windfall now to be honest,” he said. The town received about $280,000 in 2018, but the amount has been going down about 15 per cent per year, he said. At the same time, he said, the municipality has been seeing a reciprocal increase in Ontario Community Infrastructure Fund (OCIF) money – used specifically for capital projects and available to northern and rural communities with fewer than 100,000 people. Strathroy-Caradoc’s grant was $571,000 in 2018, he said. “I believe most municipalities are in the same boat,” Daikin said. “So we’re using those funds to sort of offset (OMPF reductions).” Strathroy-Caradoc has been using OMPF money for infrastructure and other capital work anyway, he said. Sarnia’s OCIF funding in 2019 is about $2.9 million, Armstrong said, up about $900,000 from 2018. In Lambton Shores, OMPF funding has been steady in recent years, said Mayor Bill Weber. “If it changes by a couple-hundred-thousand (dollars), that changes a couple per cent (in the tax rate) here in Lambton Shores,” he said. “Certainly knowing what the funding is when you’re doing your budget is helpful.”<|im_end|>

# Quantum Artificial Life --"Created for the First Time" (A 2018 Most Viewed) | The Daily Galaxy

“We leave open the question whether the origin of life is genuinely quantum mechanical,” says the team behind exciting new research that provides a breakthrough that may eventually help answer the question of whether the origin of life can be explained by quantum mechanics — a new approach announced October 2018 to one of the most enduring unsolved mysteries in science: how does life emerge from inert matter.  For the first time, with a quantum computer, individual living organisms represented at a microscopic level with superconducting qubits were made to “mate,” interact with their environment, and “die” to model some of the major factors that influence evolution.  “The goal of the proposed model is to reproduce the characteristic processes of Darwinian evolution, adapted to quantum algorithms and quantum computing,” reports Science Alerts. To do this the researchers used a five qubit IBM QX4 quantum computer developed by IBM that is accessible through the cloud. Quantum computers make use of qubits, whose information value can be a combination of both one and zero. This property, known as superposition, means that large-scale quantum computers will have vastly more information-processing power than classical computers.  The researchers, led by Enrique Solano from the University of the Basque Country in Spain, coded units of quantum life made up of two qubits (those basic building blocks of quantum physics): one to represent the genotype (the genetic code passed between generations) and one to represent the phenotype (the outward manifestation of that code or the “body”). These units were programmed to reproduce, mutate, evolve and die, in part using quantum entanglement – just as any real living being would.    The new research, published in Scientific Reports, is a breakthrough that may eventually help answer the question of whether the origin of life can be explained by quantum mechanics, a theory of physics that describes the universe in terms of the interactions between subatomic particles.  This quantum algorithm simulated major biological processes such as self-replication, mutation, interaction between individuals, and death at the level of qubits. The end result was an accurate simulation of the evolutionary process that play out at the microscopic level, with life, a complex macroscopic feature emerging from inanimate matter. Individuals were represented in the model using two qubits. One qubit represented the individual’s genotype, the genetic code behind a certain trait, and the other its phenotype, or the physical expression of that trait.  To model self-replication, the algorithm copied the expectation value (the average of the probabilities of all possible measurements) of the genotype to a new qubit through entanglement, a process that links qubits so that information is instantaneously exchanged between them. To account for mutations, the researchers encoded random qubit rotations into the algorithm that were applied to the genotype qubits.  The algorithm then modeled the interaction between the individual and its environment, which represented aging and eventually death by taking the new genotype from the self-replicating action in the previous step and transferring it to another qubit via entanglement. The new qubit represented the individual’s phenotype. The lifetime of the individual depends on the information coded in this phenotype.  Finally, these individuals interacted with one another, requiring four qubits (two genotypes and two phenotypes), but the phenotypes only interacted and exchanged information if they met certain criteria as coded in their genotype qubits. The interaction produced a new individual and the process began again. In total, the researchers repeated this process more than 24,000 times.  “Our quantum individuals are driven by an adaptation effort along the lines of a quantum Darwinian evolution, which effectively transfer the quantum information through generations of larger multi-qubit entangled states,” the researchers wrote.  While the computing technology needed to achieve so-called “quantum supremacy” isn’t quite there yet, the work of Solano and his colleagues could eventually lead to quantum computers that can autonomously model evolution without first being fed a human-designed algorithm.  “What we prove here is that microscopic quantum systems can efficiently encode quantum features and biological behaviors, usually associated with living systems and natural selection,” concluded the team.<|im_end|>

# BadgerBlitz.com - Notes: Badgers preparing for new-look Purdue team

Notes: Badgers preparing for new-look Purdue team  MADISON, Wis. - The Wisconsin Badgers (11-4, 3-1 Big Ten) will be looking to score another important Big Ten win on Friday night when they host the Purdue Boilermakers (9-6, 2-2) at the Kohl Center. Coming off of their road win over Penn State on Sunday, the Badgers will have to try and contain a Purdue team that has been a little hot and cold this season as they break in four new starters.  Of course, having a returning starter like point guard Carsen Edwards fixes a lot of rough edges. Edwards has taken on a larger role for the Boilermakers in his junior season - and is now averaging 25.5 points per game compared to 18.5 a year ago, when Purdue had three other players who averaged at least 10 points per game. Edwards might be playing without the likes of Isaac Haas, Vince Edwards, and Dakota Mathias, but UW head coach Greg Gard said the Purdue point guard has found new ways to elevate his game and take control of the Boilermaker offense. "Obviously he's a terrific player," Gard said of Edwards on Tuesday during his weekly press conference. "His explosiveness, you watch his speed with the ball, how he explodes to the rim. Now that he wasn't assertive before, but I've seen him take way more command, especially early in the year." "Their team has kind of evolved and gotten better and Matt (Painter) changed the lineup four or five games ago. I think that's helped a little bit. But I think just watching how he has grabbed a hold of his team and really has kind of put them on his back, so to speak. So explosive. So quick to the rim. As the other group is trying to play catch-up ... he's been able to hold things together as everybody else figures out their roles." In all likelihood the Badgers will have their hands full keeping Edwards under 20 points on Friday night - he's finished with fewer than 20 points in just two games so far this season (he scored 19 points in each game). Scraping another key Big Ten win might come down to how well the Badgers can bottle up the new pieces in Purdue's rotation.  Reuvers coming in to his own as a sophomore  After working his way on to the court in what was supposed to be a redshirt season for him, sophomore forward Nate Reuvers has strung together a couple of nice games since the Badgers made the switch back to Big Ten play full-time last week. Reuvers finished with 12 points against Minnesota and 11 points against Penn State, and gave the Badgers a reliable defensive presence in both games - something the coaching staff was hoping to see after Reuvers gained 25 pounds of good weight in the offseason. And now that he's shooting 50.6 percent from the floor, including 35.3 percent on his 3-pointers, the Badgers are hoping that Reuvers can take another step forward in Big Ten play when he will be battling with other big men on a night-by-night basis. "I've liked the way he's grown here," UW head coach Greg Gard said of Reuvers in his weekly press conference. "I think he's figuring out he's a big guy, and what I mean by that is the strength that he has that he gained from last year he's starting to apply that more consistently in the paint. He's very confident. You can see (from) the look on his face and the swagger he plays with that he can be a force inside and maybe that's something that he didn't always believe or have the tools to do before." The Badgers also like that Reuvers is learning how to defend the paint a little more consistently - there were times after Reuvers blocked nine shots in the team's win over Stanford where the coaching staff felt he was too eager to vacate his position and try for a block. But assistant coach Joe Krabbenhoft said after Wisconsin's loss to Minnesota last week that Reuvers has found a way to be a little more grounded on the defensive end. "I thought it was the best job he's done as far as chesting up ... staying grounded on the floor," Krabbenhoft said on Friday. "He's been a little hoppy after he got that nine block game a couple months ago, but he really did a good job against two really, really good players on the block in Jordan Murphy and Daniel Oturu. He had his hands full and he responded really well."  It's been a solid start to the season for Reuvers so far, but Krabbenhoft thinks there is more to come from the former four-star prospect.  "He's just scratching the surface," Krabbenhoft said of Reuvers. "Defensively he's got to be that anchor for us. Him and Ethan and (Charles Thomas), all those guys have to continue to do a job like they did because the bigs in this league are really good."  Badgers drop out of Top 25 Polls  The Badgers dropped out of both the AP and Coaches Polls this week following their loss to Minnesota last Thursday, which came on the heels of a road loss to Western Kentucky at the end of December. The Badgers received votes in both polls - enough to technically be No. 27 in the AP and No. 26 in the Coaches Poll. A loss to the Golden Gophers wasn't enough to drop the Badgers very far in Ken Pomeroy's efficiency rankings - he has Wisconsin ranked No. 15 in the country - third in the Big Ten, and two spots above Purdue at No. 17.  ___________________________________________________ John Veldhuis covers Wisconsin football, basketball and recruiting for BadgerBlitz.com on the Rivals.com network.

'As the Shutdown was going on, Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address. I agreed,' the president tweeted.  Washington: US President Donald Trump announced late Wednesday he would give the State of the Union address after the ongoing government shutdown ends, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi effectively blocked him from delivering the annual speech in Congress.  "As the Shutdown was going on, Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address. I agreed," the president tweeted.  "She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown, suggesting a later date. This is her prerogative - I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over."  Trump also said he was not looking for an alternative venue because none "can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber," adding he looked forwarded to giving a "'great'" address "in the near future."<|im_end|>

# Is Jacob Rees-Mogg starting to panic that 'Europhile kamikaze MPs' could box him in?

One might have wondered if Tory Brexiteers were softening after Nadine Dorries suggested on Monday night that fellow Brexiteers could end up voting for Theresa May’s deal to save it from “these Europhile kamikaze MPs”. But Jacob Rees-Mogg sought to knock such an idea on the head today, declaring at a Eurosceptic gathering that while he hoped for “reformation of this deal to make it more acceptable”, he could not vote for it “as long as the backstop is there”.  Given that Theresa May has repeatedly warned that “there’s no deal without the backstop”, its disappearance looks nigh-on impossible. And if he means exactly what he says, that suggests he and his like-minded Eurosceptics would not be satisfied...

# LG hints at 40-inch OLED launch

OLED TVs are set to get bigger and better, with the announcement that LG is to make a 40-inch OLED panel for commercial use by 2012. So far, the market for OLED TVs is smaller than Portsmouth FC's net profits, despite the panels being thinner than the club's chances of surviving the Premiership. May be expensive Now LG has hinted that more OLED TVs are in the pipeline, with a 30-inch TV pencilled in for 2010 and it looks like the company will be bringing a 40-inch TV to market in 2012. This is bigger than the 32-inch set the company mooted back in July, with LG's VP Won Kim explaining: "They may be expensive, but it will be possible to buy a 40-inch class OLED TV in 2012." We think you safely change "may" to "will" but the idea that you could possibly watch Usain Bolt charge down the 100-metre track in OLED goodness sounds like an enticing one to us.

# Parking meter profits, joining Macon airport with Atlanta’s are thoughts on his mind

Some bits and pieces:  ▪ The Macon-Bibb County Urban Development Authority has spent more than it has made on installing parking meters in downtown Macon. According to some news reports, the authority spent $405,000.00 installing the meters and has not generated enough revenue to turn a profit. I think that news is actually pretty stellar. The meters have not been in place for much more than six months. Of course, the costs are going to be more than the profit up front. But long term the potential is there for more and the profit will be used to improve downtown Macon.  ▪ A rumor circulating downtown is that some members of the Macon-Bibb County Commission want to exempt themselves from having to pay the meters. Such an effort should be opposed. The reality is that there is now available parking downtown. More people can go downtown. In fact, just from personal experience, the number of trips downtown my family takes has increased pretty significantly. We used to talk ourselves out of going downtown because of the parking hunt. Now I cannot remember the last week we avoided downtown. From Decadent, Your Pie, and Taste & See on Poplar to the Rookery and Travis Jean Emporium on Cherry, my wife, my kids and I are very likely to go downtown these days for more than church on Sunday. If you have not visited the restaurants opening along Poplar Street, you are missing out.  ▪ Georgia’s Legislature is thinking of taking over the Atlanta airport. It makes sense. The airport is the single largest economic engine in the state and it is wholly controlled by the mayor of Atlanta. Atlanta is blessed by a competent mayor. No one can argue that Mayor Keisha Bottoms is not a good steward. Though she and I may have political disagreements, she has Atlanta’s best interests at heart. But the airport affects way more than Atlanta and its control by a single politician in a single city should give us all heartburn.  Digital Access For Only $0.99  For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.  #ReadLocal  ▪ I think the legislature should also take control of the Middle Georgia Regional Airport and put it with Atlanta’s airport into an airport authority. I have long thought the local government in Macon lacks the foresight and will to expand and improve the local airport, which could be a greater economic engine for Middle Georgia. I can remember, only a few years ago, Mayor Robert Reichert wanting to expand the runway and some of the council actually argued that most of the airport’s employees did not live in Bibb County, so why bother. While the mayor has been a great champion of the airport, both Atlanta and Macon could benefit by joint planning. The calls for another airport grow more loudly in Atlanta. There is no land in north Georgia really suitable at a decent cost. Atlanta and Macon having a combined airport authority would benefit us all.  ▪ Macon-Bibb County has a $2.3 million deficit and will take money from reserves. This is the fourth consecutive year the city will take money from reserves. We spent all this time and effort consolidating the two governmental entities. Perhaps we should take more time to really start the whole budgeting process over from scratch. It seems like we are missing some fundamentals in the process. We are not a billion dollar corporation, which has to provide analysts future earnings projections. But our government does have taxpayers to whom it must account. That accounting, right now, is rather doubtful.  Erick Erickson is host of Atlanta’s Evening News on WSB Radio.<|im_end|>

# Florida State holds on for win over Miami

Finding a way to win is all that matters in college basketball. No. 13 Florida State (13-2, 1-1 ACC) did just that, holding on for an ugly 68-62 victory over in-state rival Miami (8-7, 0-3 ACC) Wednesday night before a Tucker Civic Center crowd of 10,531. It was FSU's ACC home opener. FSU led 58-45 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. But the Hurricanes kept fighting and cut the Seminoles' lead to 64-62 with 56 seconds left. FSU pushed it back to 66-62 on a putback from Terance Mann. Miami had a chance to pull within two in the final frantic seconds. But forward Ebuka Izundu's missed a dunk, ending the Hurricanes' chances of pulling off the upset. It took until the final 10 minutes of the game before FSU finally started to distance itself from UM. Mann sparked the Seminoles' advance with a couple of big baskets and some excellent defensive plays. He finished the game with nine points. Senior guard P.J. Savoy, who missed his first four three-point attempts, scored eight of his 10 points in the second half to extend FSU's lead. The Seminoles' bench depth proved to be the difference. The Hurricanes played eight players - compared to 11 for FSU - and weren't able to keep up. FSU's reserves outscored Miami's 41-10. Neither team was able to get into rhythm over the first 30 minutes due to fast whistles from the officials and poor shooting. The Seminoles couldn't find the bottom of the basket from beyond the arc for most of the game. They hit three of their first 20 attempts and finished 6-for-26. Graduate transfer guard David Nichols carried the Seminoles through the first 30 minutes. He finished with a team-high 13 points. The first half of the game was punctuated by whistle after whistle. The Seminoles were called for 12 fouls compared to just six by the Hurricanes. That led to 10 more free throw attempts for UM. The Hurricanes weren't called for a foul over the final 8:51 of the half. When Miami wasn't at the foul line, it struggled to find the bottom of the net, shooting 29.2 percent from the field and 20 percent from beyond the arc. Despite the advantage at the foul line, FSU took a 33-29 lead into the break. The Seminoles shot 42.2 percent from the field despite the struggles from the perimeter and shot 61.5 percent from the free throw line. They went to the line for just 13 free throws. FSU held Miami to just 37 percent from the field and 22 percent from three. The Seminoles now lead the all-time series between the two programs 46-36. Takeaways FSU needs to find a way out of this shooting funk with No. 1 Duke visiting Saturday. The Seminoles shot poorly against No. 2 Virginia in the 65-52 loss on Saturday and continued that against the Hurricanes. The Seminoles have made just 12 of their 49 threes against UVA and UM, and also passed up a number of open shots from the perimeter. FSU knocked down three in the final 10 minutes of the game to improve that number. FSU also needs to play redshirt sophomore forward Mfiondu Kabengele more than senior center Christ Koumadje. The Seminoles tried to run their offense through Koumadje in the second half, and it went as poorly as it could have. Koumadje was 0-for-6 from the field. Kabengele got into a bit of foul trouble, but he is a defensive force and can also find the bottom of the net. He finished with nine points and seven rebounds. Up Next FSU will host No. 1 Duke at the Tucker Civic Center on Saturday at 2 p.m. The game will be broadcast on ESPN.<|im_end|>

# Congressional Democrat Party: By Silence Anti-Semitic - California Political Review

A Democrats member who represent Palestine—no, that is NOT a typo—is upset that Jewish members of Congress support a bill to protect Israel. She says it is a conflict of interest—she, who does speeches in from of a Palestinian/terrorist flag is upset that Jews are members of Congress.  “But Tlaib obliterated that messaging strategy when she pulled out the anti-Semitic guns, saying advocates of the bill “forgot what country they represent.” The idea of Jews as having divided loyalty, and of using their influence to convince others to act against the interests and principles of their own country, is an age-old anti-Semitic trope.  Tlaib supports anti-Israel boycotts. She also defended former CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill after he was fired for calling for the elimination of Israel and endorsing violence against Jews. “ Does this Democrat support terrorism? Look at her words. Is the Pelosi silence, support of a terrorist congress member? Why does any Jew or Christian give money to a Democrats—since by their silence Democrats are admitting they hate Jews and Israel? Shame on them for financing haters and terrorist supporters.     by Philip Klein , Washington Examiner, 1/7/19    Following the silly controversy over her profanity-laced call for President Trump’s impeachment, freshman Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., has unleashed an anti-Semitic dual loyalty smear in voicing opposition to legislation combating boycotts against Israel, charging supporters of the bill “forgot what country they represent.”  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has signaled that the legislation, part of a package of bills related to Middle East policy, would be the first that the newly sworn in Senate would vote on. It would provide more leeway for state and local governments to refuse to do business with entities that have a policy of boycotting, divesting, and/or sanctioning Israel.  There is a fair debate to be had about the balancing act between combating the BDS movement and free speech, though opponents of the legislation also have to grapple with the fact that existing laws prevent governments from contracting with businesses that engage in discriminatory practices, and the movement to boycott Israeli Jews certainly is discriminatory.  Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland attempted this weekend to make a separate process argument against the bill, arguing that the Senate should not take up any business unrelated to ending the partial government shutdown.  But Tlaib obliterated that messaging strategy when she pulled out the anti-Semitic guns, saying advocates of the bill “forgot what country they represent.” The idea of Jews as having divided loyalty, and of using their influence to convince others to act against the interests and principles of their own country, is an age-old anti-Semitic trope. 
Tlaib supports anti-Israel boycotts. She also defended former CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill after he was fired for calling for the elimination of Israel and endorsing violence against Jews. The Democratic Party has a festering anti-Semitism problem within its own ranks, and so far it seems content to look the other way and excuse the deployment of stereotypical attacks on Jews as long as they are thinly masked as mere criticism of Israel.<|im_end|>

# Mourinho's longtime No 2 takes 1st senior job in Qatar

DOHA, Qatar (AP) — The longtime right-hand man of Jose Mourinho has taken up his first senior managerial job at a club in Qatar.  Rui Faria, who spent 17 years as Mourinho’s assistant at Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Manchester United among other clubs, has signed a contract with Al Duhail.  The Qatari club announced the arrival of Faria on Friday, saying “one of the special names in the world of coaching” had turned down “great European offers.”  Faria will be presented in his new role in the coming days. On leaving United at the end of last season, the Portuguese coach said he wanted to “spend much more quality time with my family before pursuing a new challenge in my professional life.”  Insight by Citrix Public Sector: Federal practitioners describe multi-cloud security in this exclusive executive briefing.  ___  More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports  Copyright © 2019 The Associated Press.

# Peak denim

The acceptance of low-rise?  By Isabelle Orr, Entertainment Editor    Ah, jeans. What other article of clothing can strike fear into the hearts of shoppers more than the dreaded denim? With the right fit, jeans can be as comfortable and relaxing as watching The Devil Wears Prada for the 64th time.  We’ve really seen it all in the past year—wide leg, slim leg, torn knees, torn hems. Lately, as mainstream fashion turns its fickle eye towards the ’70s for inspiration, the previously banned indigo denim has been revived on Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren runways. It feels almost sacrilegious to even think of wearing a dark pair of jeans after what feels like a decade of acid and light wash—and that’s not even the worst news.  “Low-rise jeans are due for a comeback!” exclaim big magazines like GQ and Man Repeller. Their articles are studded with pictures of slim celebrities like Bella Hadid and Keke Palmer, both of whom could wear three garbage bags tied together and look better than I did at my high school prom. Low-rise jeans call to mind horrible fashion mistakes from the early 2000s, such as wallet chains, puffy sneakers, and Baby Phat. On top of looking dated, low-rise jeans seem to only highlight every square inch of excess chub on one’s frame, while exposing the tender midriff to the cruel hands of nature. That’s why my soft body is always firmly encased in stiff, high-waisted denim that is thick enough to stop bullets.  Trend forecaster Ayesha A. Siddiqi has scoffed at the alleged reemergence, saying on Twitter that low-rise coming back is a “false forecast.” In fact, she stated, “We’ve reached peak denim you can wear [whatever] jeans you want and be ok.”  Siddiqi is definitely onto something. Take the Jesse Kamm sailor pant, which I declared “the worst thing I’ve ever seen” when I first saw it on social media. They were the complete opposite of the skinny jeans of my youth and were declared “weird-looking” by almost every cis straight man in my life (of which there are few). After seeing the sailor pant in a couple of Madewell Instagram ads, filtered through some models I follow, and finally seeing it on real-life people, I am now the proud—if not broke—owner of two separate pairs.  Seeing articles of clothing on different platforms, styled different ways, and modelled by people of all different sizes makes almost anything palatable. We’re so oversaturated with clothing of every fabric, shape, and colour that at this point low-rise jeans don’t seem that crazy.  During every fashion cycle, I attach myself to an article of clothing—2010: skinny jeans, 2011: cardigans, 2012: peasant tops—and declare to the world, “This is me now!” But as trends change, my one “thing” often falls to the wayside—and that’s okay! As most fashion-conscious people know, clothing trends are eerily cyclical. While I’m definitely not going to jump on the low-rise jeans this time around, maybe when they come back in in 2031, my slim, robot body will be willing and ready to throw on a pair of Nasty Gal hip-huggers. Here’s hoping!<|im_end|>

# Mayo Clinic recommends banning checking for Bantam-aged hockey players

ROCHESTER, Minn. (FOX 9) - Precautions normally seen in football are expanding in the hockey world. The Mayo Clinic gave new recommendations Wednesday in an effort to lower the risk of concussions for hockey players. Bantam hockey, in which kids are generally in 8th and 9th grades, is an age where size differences among players can be enormous. “And there’s such a disparity between the little wee kid who’s 13 and 14 and the kid who’s shaving,” said Dr. Aynsley Smith, of the Mayo Clinic. The Mayo Clinic’s lead researcher into ice hockey says there’s no reason they need to be checking and a lot of reasons they shouldn’t. “It’s a healthier thing and if we really want to grow the game, we’ve got to stop seeking violence and promoting it and encouraging the kids to absolutely staple the opponent,” Smith added. No checking at the Bantam level is one of the recommendations made by the Mayo Clinic to prevent and treat concussions. Also, doctors there are advocating for concussion databases across all levels. In addition, they recommend enforcing ejections for fighting, better diagnostic tests and mandatory baseline testing to help make those diagnoses. At most rinks, you’ll find mid-day adult drop-in hockey and there is no checking, but where you can easily find the debate over bantams checking. “I could go both ways on that,” said a hockey parent. “In one way, I think the younger they learn how to check, the safer the game is when they get older.” A lot of parents and youth coaches believe it’s a part of the game and it’s safer if learned sooner. “I think you need to learn how to do that and protect yourself on the ice,” said another parent. “And I don’t see any real upside to delaying that until they’re bigger and stronger.” “I can say that USA Hockey, Minnesota Hockey are both taking a hard look at it,” said Glen Adresen, of USA Hockey. USA Hockey, which encompasses Minnesota Hockey, took checking out of Peewee hockey seven years ago to similar criticisms, but they hear few complaints now. Doing the same at Bantams has been discussed a lot more the past couple of years and the Mayo Clinic has just put more fuel on that fire. “Do we remove all checking or is it the certain blow-up hits or things like that,” said Glen Andresen, the Executive Director of Minnesota Hockey. “So, there’s a lot to be done beyond the dissuasions at the winter meetings in Orlando.”<|im_end|>

# 3 Swedish county governors back 2026 Olympic bid

STOCKHOLM — Three county governors in Sweden have expressed “strong support” for the 2026 Winter Olympics to be held in their regions.  Ylva Thorn, Jotan Hagglund and Sven-Erik Osterberg — the heads of the counties of Dalarna, Jamtland and Stockholm — say they are “very proud of the bid.”  The trio says in a statement “the whole concept” is to “include already existing arenas and use already planned investments as a go ahead for the games.”  In 2017, Stockholm announced the city would not submit its expected bid after the mayor had expressed concern about the costs. In October, the capital’s newly formed local government said the city’s taxpayers will not be asked to foot the bill. Sweden’s caretaking government has said it would not provide funding to host the games in Stockholm.  There are two other candidates for the 2026 Olympics: Calgary, Canada, and the combined Italian bid of Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo. A vote of IOC members is scheduled for June.  ___  More AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports  Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

# Hitachi Says No Decision Made On U.K. Nuclear Plant

TOKYO (dpa-AFX) - Japanese conglomerate Hitachi Ltd. said that 'no formal decision' has been made over the future of a UK nuclear plant following a report it would halt construction. The Nikkei Asian Review reported the firm's board would be likely to decide to suspend all work on the Wylfa Newydd plant next week. The company will book a loss of between 200 billion yen and 300 billion yen ($2.8 billion) after freezing assets of its British nuclear business and writing down their value, the Nikkei reported. In December, the firm said it would do its utmost to ensure the nuclear power facility went ahead. It followed mounting speculation that Hitachi was considering scrapping the project due to potential increases in construction costs. 'No formal decision has been made in this regard currently, while Hitachi has been assessing the Horizon Project including its potential suspension and related financial impacts in terms of economic rationality as a private company,' Hitachi said.

# MED-Star Ambulance Requesting Financial Assistance

MED-Star Ambulance Requesting Financial Assistance With a population of over 10,000 a city that size should have the necessary emergency services. The city of Brandon, South Dakota has been served by MED-Star Ambulance since 2007 and according to KSFY News the companies CEO is asking the city for financial assistance. KSFY is reporting that MED-Star has reached out to the city council of Brandon to help take the edge off some of the expenses the business is covering. Jay Masur and his company are not certain they will get the needed funds to continue the 911 service but his business is losing money faster than its being made. In a recent vote by council members Masur said they were 5-1 in support of helping the service and he said during the second hearing council members voted 4-2 against providing assistance. KSFY News also says the Brandon City Council doesn't want to fund a for profit ambulance service. Masur said they're not making a profit right now and they're at a deficit of $400,000 a year. The Brandon city council will meet in two weeks and med-star will hopefully have an answer.<|im_end|>

# Oil steady as U.S. gasoline glut offsets Venezuela turmoil

Brent crude futures fell 18 cents to $60.96 a barrel by 11:23 a.m. EST (1623 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 24 cents to $52.86 a barrel. U.S. crude inventories sharply rose by 8 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, versus forecasts of a decline of 42,000 barrels. Gasoline stocks rose for the eighth straight week to a record 259.7 million barrels, as demand for the motor fuel over past four weeks fell 0.1 percent from year ago. "The report was rather bearish, punctuated by the large crude oil inventory increase," said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital Management. "Gasoline demand remains anemic." Worries about the longer-term outlook for global economic growth, and therefore demand for crude, has been undermining bullish moves in the oil market. Persistent concerns about the U.S-China trade war as well as slower world growth forecasts have kept investors wary. (For graphic on World economic growth and oil demand, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2S3IC0h NEW UPSIDE RISK However, Brent earlier hit a session high on Thursday of $61.38 after the United States signalled that it could impose sanctions on Venezuela's crude exports as Caracas descends further into political and economic turmoil. Venezuelan oil is predominantly heavy crude, which requires extensive refining. It is frequently blended with lighter crudes to give refiners higher-value products. With Iran already crippled by U.S. sanctions, a drop in Venezuelan exports could squeeze global supply further. Geneva-based Petro-Logistics said on its website that Iranian crude and condensate exports in December "fell steeply" from November to less than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) due to U.S. sanctions - lower than some other estimates. "The potential is that the U.S. is starting to put things in motion and the risk for an acceleration in the decline in production from Venezuela is increasing," Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said. "This does provide a new upside risk for the market." The Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) contract are both backed by light, sweet crude, and are not directly linked to Venezuelan oil. But concern about the supply of heavy crudes is apparent in the U.S. physical market, where the price for Mars Sour, a medium crude, shot to its highest since early 2011.

# Sabres at Flames: Five Things to Know

CALGARY – The road trip does not get easier for the Buffalo Sabres. In fact, their game tonight against the Calgary Flames could be one of the more difficult tests of the season and it could not come at a worse time.  The Sabres (23-17-6) suffered arguably their worst loss of the season Monday in Edmonton when they allowed a season-high seven goals. The Flames (30-13-4) are atop the Western Conference with 64 points and are on a five-game winning streak.  On paper, it is a terrible matchup for the struggling Sabres, who have won only six of their last 21 games. Puck drop in Scotiabank Saddledome is 9:30 p.m. EST.  "We know that they’re going to be a very desperate team, not only with where they’re at in the standings but the way their last game went against Edmonton," Flames winger Matthew Tkachuk said.  1. Lineup: Lawrence Pilut was not a healthy scratch for long. The 23-year-old defenseman will be back in the lineup tonight after he was replaced by Nathan Beaulieu against the Oilers. Beaulieu had played only two of the previous 12 games and it showed.  Marco Scandella remained in the lineup despite his egregious turnover against the Oilers and will skate alongside Jake McCabe. Pilut is paired with Rasmus Ristolainen, while the forward lines did not change from Tuesday's practice:   Sabres’ lines the same as last night:  Skinner-Eichel-Reinhart  Sheary-Mittelstadt-Thompson Sobotka-Rodrigues-Pominville Girgensons-Larsson-Okposo — Lance Lysowski (@LLysowski) January 15, 2019 Neither defenseman Travis Hamonic nor winger James Neal will play tonight against the Sabres, according to Flames coach Bill Peters. Hamonic has 12 points with a plus-7 rating in 38 games this season, while Neal has struggled with a negative-11 rating and only 10 points.  David Rittich, who is 17-4-3 with a .920 save percentage this season, will start for the Flames.  2. Goalie change: Linus Ullmark will start for the Sabres tonight, according to coach Phil Housley. Carter Hutton was pulled Monday in Edmonton after allowing five goals on 12 shots, though Housley gave Hutton a vote of confidence following practice Tuesday.  Hutton has been the victim of bad luck, but he has lost eight of his last nine starts. Ullmark, meanwhile, is 9-3-3 with a .918 save percentage this season. He has started two of the past three games and allowed five goals on 30 shots against Tampa Bay on Saturday.  3. On fire: The Flames rank second in the NHL in goals (173) and have four players with at least 20 goals. Winger Johnny Gaudreau ranks seventh in the league in goals (27, tied), fifth in assists (42) and second in points (69, tied).  He also is surrounded by a strong supporting cast, including Sean Monahan (25 goals), Tkachuk (23) and Elias Lindholm (21). The Flames average only 31.8 shots per game – which ranks 15th – but they have the skill to take advantage of opponents' mistakes. Calgary's 7-1 win over Arizona on Sunday was the Flames' sixth seven-goal game of the season.  Buffalo lost to Calgary, 2-1, in KeyBank Center on Oct. 30.  "They’re playing with a lot of confidence," Housley said of the Flames. "It presents a great challenge for us. Their transition game is one of the best in the league, so we’re going to have to manage that part of our game and we’re going to have to check better. Our attention to detail got away from us a little bit in Edmonton. We’re going to focus on that because this team is a very high-powered offense."  4. Jack's drought: The Sabres need a big game out of Jack Eichel. He has only one point in their last nine games, though he missed three-plus games because of an upper-body injury.  His line controlled play against the Oilers, but they were unable to beat goalie Mikko Koskinen. Prior to the game in Edmonton, Eichel acknowledged that he was not at his best during his first two games back from injury. That's only natural.  Eichel seems to play his best against top teams and top players. Gaudreau is regarded by many as among the top five players in the NHL.  "I think just simplify his game," Housley on what Eichel needs to do to score. "Jack is our captain for a reason. He means well. His attentions are well. He cares about his teammates, he cares about the City of Buffalo and wants to win. Sometimes that burden can get the best of him. Simplify his game, take what the game gives him, shoot more pucks, go to the net – things will happen for him. "  5. By the numbers: The Flames are 8-1-1 in their last 10 games and matched their franchise record for fewest games to record 30 wins (47 games played), a mark previously set in 1988-89 when they won the Stanley Cup. ... Gaudreau has an eight-game point streak and his 21 multipoint games are 12 shy of the franchise record for most in a season. ... Buffalo leads the all-time series with Calgary, 52-37-18. ... The Sabres are 9-3-1 against the Pacific Division this season.<|im_end|>

Copa del Rey: Barcelona fall to shock 2-1 defeat at Levante in last-16 first leg  Holders Barcelona fell to a shock 2-1 defeat to Levante in the first leg of their Copa Del Rey last-16 tie. Erick Cabaco and Borja Mayoral scored in the opening 20 minutes to give the hosts a comfortable lead at half-time. Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho pulled a goal back for Barcelona with a late penalty. The defeat came just three weeks after Barca had thrashed Levante 5-0 in the league, with Lionel Messi scoring a hat-trick.

# Fans Of NCT's Haechan Fundraise For LA Zoo In Latest K-Pop-Oriented Charitable Campaign

It took a handful of hours on Wednesday night (Jan. 9) for fans of K-pop star Haechan (Lee Dong-hyuk) to donate $2,000 to Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens. The reason? Fans of the 18-year-old singer, a member of NCT and its associated NCT 127 and NCT Dream teams, thought that a newborn southern pudu fawn seemingly resembled the artist, and so the Zoo offered them a chance to have the animal named in his honor if they could come up with the funds.  “It's come to our attention that Haechan of the K-pop group NCT is considered by many of his fans to resemble an adorable pudu,” the initial post on their Twitter account read that night, posted just after 8PM EST. “So we want to give fans the opportunity to officially name the newborn fawn after the singer!”  According to the Zoo, animals born there are typically “given names chosen by donors wishing to support conservation work.” But in this case fans became the conservators as the Zoo offered them the chance to raise $2,000 in the name of the star within five days so that the animal could be named after him. It took around three hours.    “Wow! NCT fans have met the goal already, and we are so grateful--as a nonprofit, your generosity means the world,” the Zoo shared on its social media accounts just after 11PM. “We'll update you tomorrow about the official naming, and sincere thanks from all who care for the animals…especially pudus Mario, Steph, & baby Haechan.”  As of time of publication, the fund had raised $2,579 by 187 donors.  K-pop fans, and music fans in general, donating in the name of their favorite artist is not a new trend in 2019, but a pudu being named Haechan is the latest in a long history of charitable giving being made in the name of stars coming out of the South Korean music world. Whether it’s donating food or forests — yes, entire forests — the practice has become enmeshed in the fandom lifestyle for many K-pop aficionados.  In 2013, The Korea Herald reported that the fan-led donations grew out of gift giving practices, with fans opting to spend funds on charitable gifts in the name of stars rather than gift goods directly to the stars, a common practice in the K-pop world. The practice has seen widespread growth over the years, and, unlike the spontaneous pudu conservation fund donations, many fandoms regularly organize large-scale donations and campaigns.  In recent years, the practice has become even more widespread, and the scale of donations have increased. In December, there were reports that a Chinese fanbase of EXO’s Kai, Baidu Kaibar, planned to build a primary school in the Lianghe, China in his name. That same month, the BTS-associated Love Myself UNICEF campaign had collected an accumulated fund of $1.6 Million USD, based based on donations from the act, its label and fans. Organizers like One In an ARMY, a BTS fanbase that comes up with monthly donation campaigns to raise funds for different charities, are increasingly commonplace.  As K-pop’s global fandom grows, the associated spending is similarly increasing in scale. Not only are fans using money on marketing their favorite artists, they’re making the world a better place in the name of their favorite pop love. With nearly 90 million fans of Korean pop culture worldwide as 2019 kicks off, the spending power, or donating power in this case, of K-pop fans should not be underestimated as a force for good.   I am a New York City-based journalist specializing in international music and media with a focus on the Asian pop culture market and its trends. Along with being a K-pop columnist at Billboard, I’ve written for outlets including NBC News, Entertainment Weekly, The Village V... MORE<|im_end|>

# 'Praise the Lord': Abducted Teen Jayme Closs Found Alive After 3 Months Captivity

A 13-year-old Wisconsin girl who went missing in October after her parents were killed has been found alive, and a suspect was taken into custody.  Jayme Closs had been missing since her parents were found shot to death in October in the family's home near Barron, Wisconsin. Investigators said Jayme was quickly ruled out as a suspect.  Authorities said at a news conference Friday that Jayme was found near the town of Gordon located about 65 miles north of her hometown.  She had walked away from the cabin in which she was being held captive and approached a woman out walking her dog in a neighborhood, who notified a neighbor and called 911.  Authorities say 21-year-old Jake Thomas Patterson was arrested in the case based on a description of his vehicle that Jayme was able to provide.  "Eighty-eight days ago we stood before you speaking about the unthinkable tragedy, and asked you to help us find 13-year-old Jayme Closs," said Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald of Barron County, Wisconsin. "For 88 days, you called in tips brought us food, searched arm in arm with us, wrote us notes and never gave up hope."  Sue Allard, Jayme's aunt, told a local news outlet that she could barely express her joy after learning the news Thursday night.  "Praise the Lord," Allard said. "It's the news we've been waiting on for three months. I can't wait to get my arms around her. I just can't wait."  "There was a lot of discouragement because this took quite a while to play out," Barron Mayor Ron Fladten said. "A lot of people have been praying daily, as I have. It's just a great result we got tonight. It's unbelievable. It's like taking a big black cloud in the sky and getting rid of it and the sun comes out again."  "A lot of people were very concerned, did a lot of praying," said town chairman Denny Kline. "Prayers were answered, for finding her, anyway."<|im_end|>

# After a week of reflection, Craig Elliott prepares his Boston United side for Kidderminster Harriers test

After a week of soul searching Craig Elliott is preparing to take his Boston United side to Kidderminster Harriers.  Two underachieving sides will meet at Aggborough today, both keen to pick up the three points that could act as a springboard for their season. For Boston, 12th in the National League North, they will be looking to end a winless run of five matches, including two late levellers which cost them victories. Ninth-placed Harriers have recorded two wins and two draws from their last 11 contest. Saturday’s clash will see chairman Colin Gordon take charge of the club at home for the first time this season following the exit of Neil Macfarlane. He made his dug-out debut during Tuesday’s 2-1 defeat at Spennymoor. After a hectic Christmas period which saw Boston play four times in 11 days, Elliott has spent the past week reflecting on his side’s recent form and, in particular, the 2-1 defeat to Altrincham last weekend. “It’s about picking up our confidence this week and me reflecting on myself and whether I’ve got it right,” he said. “I just think, analyising individuals, formations. “We’ve been pretty consistent for four or five weeks, similar formation, similar starting XI. They’ve been a fraud (against Altrincham), back to what they were like.” Five Pilgrims played every minute of Boston’s past five matches (George Willis, Andy Thanoj, Ryan Qualter, Ashley Jackson and Ben Davies), with Brad Abbott, Nicky Walker and Max Wright also starting each of those games. Does Elliott believe complacency could be creeping in? “There’s probably a case for that, a case that they looked leggy as well,” the manager added, before warning his team they need to approach today’s game the right way. “If I’m using excuses, a bit, as there’s some players who have played every minute. “But I think they’re excuses really, they mentally didn’t approach the game the right way.” Kick off will be at 3pm.<|im_end|>

Davis is an outspoken supporter of a movement criticizing Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The board withdrew her award after a local Holocaust education group asked it to reconsider.

# CBD Shop OK’d to Replace Gallery Space - Laguna Beach Local News

By Daniel Langhorne, Special to the Independent  The Planning Commission approved a conditional use permit Jan. 23 for a cannabidiol (CBD) product store at the former Main Beach Fine Art Gallery at 206 North Coast Highway, which would be the first of its kind in Laguna Beach.  Lagona Apothecary will be restricted to selling bath bombs, soaps, skin care products, gel capsules, and dropper bottles containing the industrial hemp-derived oil, which does not contain the psychoactive traits of marijuana. However, some residents who opposed Measure KK, a 2016 ballot initiative to allow medical marijuana dispensaries in Laguna Beach, also came out in opposition to the new CBD store partly because the Food and Drug Administration doesn’t verify the efficacy of CBD products.  Patrick Murphy, of Cypress, a Marine Corps veteran and retired aerospace engineer, said he was motivated to open a CBD store after using similar products to treat his arthritis.  “I believe there is some magic here in Laguna Beach,” Murphy said. “I had been in that art gallery many times in the past and looked out those windows. To tell you the truth, I never thought I’d be here but I’m happy to be here.”  Laguna Beach resident Jon Conk said the Planning Commission should respect the will of the nearly 71 percent of voters who opposed medical marijuana dispensaries in town.  “The residents of Laguna Beach have made it crystal clear that we don’t want marijuana products of any kind sold here,” Conk said. “CBD is a marijuana product.”  Even though he’s opposed to a CBD storefront in Laguna Beach, Conk said he’s not opposed to using cannabis products to treat legitimate medical conditions if prescribed by a doctor with proper safeguards.  Although federal law allows CBD edibles to be sold for human and animal consumption, the State Department of Public Health has ruled that they are still illegal. If state law changes, the store would then be permitted to sell CBD-infused water, protein powder, chocolate, and pet treats.  Planning Commissioner Susan McLintock Whitin asked city staff whether there was any conflict with local, state, or federal laws identified by the City Attorney, who shared no objections to the application. She also pointed out that the Planning Commission has the right to reexamine and revoke the conditional use permit if its terms aren’t followed.  “That’s my insurance plan to address the concerns of all of us frankly,” Whitin said. “From my reading, I know there is literature out there that addresses the childhood epilepsy and arthritis, but I also know there is literature that calls it snake oil.”  Planning Commissioner Anne Johnson cast the only vote against the CBD store because she said she didn’t have enough objective evidence that CBD offers a medical remedy for users.  “I’m more interested in what the community said in Measure KK,” she said.  Considering that there are marijuana delivery services that already serve Laguna Beach residents, Planning Commissioner Ken Sadler said Lagona Apothecary will attract a different customer looking for real medical benefits, and if they’re unsatisfied with the product, they’ll take their business elsewhere.  “If people want to get high, they are going to go to a marijuana dispensary,” Sadler said. “The idea that CBD is going to be a slippery slope to a medical dispensary just doesn’t make sense.”  Opponents have 14 days to appeal the Planning Commission’s decision to the City Council.<|im_end|>

# Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson: Warriors face tough trade decision - EXCLUSIVE

The Warriors have reached the NBA Finals in each of the last five seasons, suffering defeat just once in 2016. But they could lose the spine of their side as Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and DeMarcus Cousins may depart this summer. The quadruple are all in the final six months of their existing contracts. And Boston Celtics’ ten-time NBA All-Star Pierce reckons Steve Kerr is in for a difficult offseason. "I don't know man, it will be tough (to keep hold of the current players),” Pierce exclusively told Express Sport while at the PokerStars Players No Limit Hold’em Championship (PSPC) in the Bahamas. "These guys have won a lot of games together and have been together for a few years now. "They do have Kevin Durant coming up, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and even Boogie Cousins, he will be a free agent. "They have got a lot of decisions they are going to have to make this summer if they want to keep this team." It is thought Durant wants to win the Championship with another franchise to strengthen his legacy. But Pierce does not feel the small forward has to move to prove his worth. “He is just adding the icing on the cake now," he added. "He is one of the greatest players already. "He has got two Championships, two MVPs. "If I was him I wouldn't leave because he has got a chance of being one of the greatest by winning more Championships. "It is a tough decision, it depends on what these players value these days."<|im_end|>

# X Factor winner’s accountant jailed after stealing £600K from singer

X Factor winner James Arthur’s accountant is jailed for four years after stealing £600,000 from the singer’s account to finance his online gambling addiction Mark Livermore took money from James Arthur's account while he was on tour He originally took £10,000 hoping it would cover his debts but his wagers lost Livermore had been explaining withdrawals by saying they were ‘tax provisions’ Lawyer said Livermore, from Essex, was 'deeply ashamed and embarrassed' Accountant Mark Livermore has been jailed for four years after he took £599,000 from singer James Arthur's, pictured, account The accountant for X Factor winner James Arthur has been jailed today for four years after he swindled the singer out of £599,000. Mark Livermore, 39, fleeced the star to finance his online betting addiction after he was given access to his singer’s bank accounts while he was on tour. The accountant, who lives in Billericay, Essex, admitted fraud by abuse of position at City of London Magistrates’ Court on 18 December last year. He had joined MGM Accountancy Limited in 2001 where he was mentored by a director of the firm Guy Rippon, 68. Mr Rippon gave a statement to Southwark Crown Court explaining his firm had suffered tremendous reputational damage and he felt betrayed by his protégée. For five years Mr Livermore credit card fees spiralled out of control and as his addiction reached its lowest point, he looked for a way out. He believed by taking £10,000 out of Mr Arthur’s account he could make enough money from successful bets to cover his fees and repay Mr Arthur - but his wagers lost. The thefts were discovered when Mr Rippon reviewed client’s accounts and noticed withdrawals from Mr Arthur’s account had been passing into Livermore’s. He was supported today by friends and family who watched sadly as he rested his head on the glass of the dock as he was jailed. Livermore admitted fraud by abuse of position and was jailed today at Southwark Crown Court, pictured. The court was told he took the money to finance his online betting addiction Jailing him Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said: ‘I am satisfied that up until this point you were a hard-working and successful professional and a very good family man. ‘But at some point, you took to spread betting. To start with you were doing it with your own money and then with clients. ‘I am told your decision to steal money from James Arthur was because you had access to his bank accounts. ‘Your actions have been disastrous for the firm and of course your family. This was not a one-off fraud you committed these thefts regularly.’ The Financial Reporting Council will now bar him from future employment as an accountant. His lawyer, Christopher Martin, told the court: ‘James Arthur was not chosen, there was never any intention to defraud Mr Arthur or his company of nearly £600,000. ‘It was just feeding his addiction. As soon as the offence was revealed Mr Livermore offered to pay back £200,000 in a very short amount of time- it would come from his father.’ He added his client has lost everything he held dear and was deeply ashamed and embarrassed. Mr Arthur, 30, who was the 9th X-Factor winner in 2012 was told by Livermore over text that he had stolen from him. Livermore had been explaining his withdrawals by saying they were ‘tax provisions.’ It is understood Mr Arthur’s losses will be covered by insurance. Livermore of San Marie, Second Avenue Billericay, Essex, admitted fraud by abuse of position on or before April 2018, and was jailed for four years today. He will serve half of his sentence before being released.<|im_end|>

# Asian Cup 2019: India v Bahrain - Four players to renew rivalry eight years on | Goal.com

India take on Bahrain in their final Group A game of the AFC Asian Cup 2019 at Sharjah on Monday, but exactly eight years ago, 680 kilometres away, the very fixture was being played out in the 2011 edition in Qatar. Much has changed since then. The scoreline at the end of the 90 minutes read 5-2 in favour of the Gulf side and India were handed a return ticket with a game to spare. Come 2019, the circumstances are different as the Blue Tigers stand on the cusp of history as they need only a draw to ensure a smooth passage into the Asian Cup knockouts. However, there are some constants - four players are set to renew their rivalry in the UAE from 14 January 2011. India's Sunil Chhetri will line up against Al Ahmar once again, hoping to score a goal as he did in 2011. Back then, a 26-year-old, it was his first ever goal at the showpiece tournament. On the other side, it will be current Bahrain captain Abdulwahab Al-Safi who will reprise his role in midfield. He was responsible for giving away the free-kick in the ninth minute of the game which saw Renedy Singh's delivery being flicked by Abhishek Yadav inside the box for Gouramangi Singh to head home. While Chhetri and Al-Safi played the full 90 minutes, a couple of players from each camp remained on the bench. Waleed Al Hayam and Gurpreet Singh Sandhu saw the action from the touchline but are very much important figures for their respective teams eight years on. Al Hayam, who was given jersey no. 10 in the 2011 tournament, was recognised as a midfielder. He has now turned into a defender and plays in the left centre-half position in Miroslav Soukup's side. Goalkeeper Sandhu was third-choice in 2011 behing Subrata Paul and Subhasish Roy Chowdhury and the 18-year-old was only taken to the tournament by Bob Houghton to give the promising talent some experience. After his stint with Norwegian club Stabaek with whom he became the first Indian to feature in the UEFA Europa League, he has established himself as India's numero uno between the sticks in the last three years. While Al-Safi and Al Hayam might have fond memories of that night in 2011, Chhetri and Sandhu will be looking to avenge the defeat and hope that January 14 is remembered more fondly.<|im_end|>

# Chandigarh: SBI seeks FIR in Rs 78-lakh loan fraud

The State Bank of India (SBI) has moved an application in the district court of Chandigarh, seeking registration of an FIR against six persons for allegedly committing a loan fraud worth Rs 78 lakh. The loans were allegedly granted through Bhartiya Mahila Bank (BMB), which in April 2017 merged with the SBI. The case is scheduled for hearing on February 15.  The application has been moved in the court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Varun Nagpal under Section 156(3) of Criminal Procedure Code. The Chandigarh Police, meanwhile, has filed a reply stating that the case will be investigated by Economic Offences Wing.  The SBI has sought FIR against suspended branch manager of BMB Manish Kumar Rajak, gramin micro finance employees Usha Rani, Ram Kumar and Munish Kumar Bharadwaj, Branch Manager of BMB Chander Pandey and Proprietor of Gramin India Micro Finance H M Cheema.  In the application, the SBI branch of Sector 26, through its manager, Tara Chand, has said that on April 6, 2017, the BMB branch of Sector 26 had merged with them. It has been alleged that 224 mudra loans were sanctioned in the BMB, Sector 26, branch during the period 2014-2016 and out of these, some turned out to be bad and classified as NPA (Non-performing Asset). When all the customers, who were granted loan, were approached for recovery, it was learnt that they had taken loans with the help of Rajak and Usha Rani.  Advocate Davinder Singh Soundh, counsel for the SBI, said that some customers gave in writing to the bank that they have obtained the loan with the help of accused Usha Rani, Pandey, Kumar, Cheema and Kumar and even they have recovered the amount from them in installments. But, the SBI found that the amount was not deposited further with it. The SBI has also learnt that from the customers that they have received less money than the sanctioned amount of loan and remaining was deducted by them on the pretext of file charges at the time of disbursement of the loan amount. The repayment of the loan was done through the accused under the name of Gramin India Micro Finance Foundation.  In 15 mudra loans sanctioned during 2014-2016, address mentioned as per KYC (Know Your Customer) documents, submitted by the borrower, is of Nehru Colony, Kajheri, which was dismantled in 2014 by Municipal Corporation Chandigarh. Despite of the fact, these loans got sanctioned from the BMB Sector 26, Chandigarh.  Advocate Soundh told that the bank has conducted a departmental inquiry and thus suspended Rajak and Rani. 
For further action, a formal complaint was registered at Sector 26 police station, however, the police allegedly did not take any action, following which the SBI had to approach the court.<|im_end|>

# Sixth council ends ties with contractor this month

Torbay BC is expected to set up a company to replace a joint venture with contractor Kier, which would make it the sixth council in a month to end ties with the company. The council pays £10.9m a year for waste, street scene, vehicle and building management operation to TOR2, which is owned 80.01% by Kier and 19.99% by Torbay.  torbay  This contract expires in July 2020 and a report going to the council next week said it should not be extended as “there are some key elements of the original joint venture concept which have not been as expected”.  It added TOR2 “has not generated a dividend as was expected…[has] not improved recycling rates at a sufficient pace and are unlikely to achieve the target recycling rate of 50% (or above) by 2020”.  The report went on to note “poor performance has been highlighted in relation to waste collection which led to a vote of no confidence from Brixham Town Council”. It said that delivering the services through a local authority company, “would allow the council the absolute control and flexibility to review future delivery of services and consider private sector suppliers for the services or parts thereof”.  Shared services could be established in the future, the report added, but time did not allow this option before the contract ends.  Cheshire West & Chester Council last week voted to establish a council owned company to deliver its waste services after Kier said it wished to end the contract, LGC’s sister title Materials Recycling World has reported.  A Cheshire West & Chester paper noted Kier had said it would leave the waste market after problems on its contract, and another in East Sussex, landed it with an extra cost of £35m in 2016.  Hastings BC and Rother and Wealden DCs appointed contractor Biffa this month to replace Kier after a mutual decision to terminate their joint contract early.  Eastbourne BC had been part of this contract but has set up South East Environmental Services to handle its work in-house.  Kier’s 2018 annual report said it would reduce exposure to the waste market as existing contracts ended and did not list waste among nine other industries as “our key market sectors”.  A A Kier spokesperson told MRW: “We continue to be committed to delivering a quality waste management service for all our contracts in the industry. We are a responsible contractor that continues to serve more than 500,000 households each week, with client and customer satisfaction at the heart of our reliable service.”  In a separate development, the company’s chief executive Haydn Mursell stood down with immediate effect this week.  LGC’s sister title Construction News reported he had been under pressure since Kier announced a £250m rights issue in November, which saw its share price plummet 40%.  Kier said in a trading update the company it was on track to meet previous expectations for the year to June 2019.<|im_end|>

# Student hit by SUV in elementary school parking lot in Ocean Crest neighborhood

An 11-year-old student suffered a head injury after the child was struck by an SUV in a school parking lot shortly before classes started Friday morning, San Diego police said. The incident happened just after 8 a.m. at Ocean View Hills Elementary School, on Del Sol Boulevard in the Ocean Crest neighborhood near Otay Mesa. According to police, the child had run in front of a 2017 Cadillac Escalade driven by a 57-year-old woman. The incident happened on an access road in back of the school by a park, a district official said.  The child was taken to a hospital with a head injury that police said was not considered to be life-threatening. San Ysidro School District spokesman Francisco Mata said administrators sent parents a letter to notify them of the incident.

# Anonymous NBA Exec: Lakers' Lonzo Ball Doesn't Have Personality to 'Run a Team'

The Los Angeles Lakers believed in Lonzo Ball enough to make him the No. 2 overall pick in 2017, but as the Feb. 7 trade deadline approaches, there are mixed reviews throughout the league about the second-year point guard. According to the Los Angeles Times' Dan Woike on Saturday, one NBA executive doesn't believe Ball has the personality to "run a team," while an Eastern Conference scout said the former UCLA star has been too passive at the start of his professional career. Meanwhile, Woike reported another scout believes Ball "will figure out his shot. His style of play is appealing and contagious. A change of scenery will do him wonders, I think." Ball has been asked to take a major step forward in Year 2 after the addition of four-time NBA MVP LeBron James caused expectations in Hollywood to soar. Thus far, the 21-year-old is averaging 9.9 points, 5.4 assists, 5.3 rebounds and 1.5 steals per game in 2018-19. Of note, Los Angeles recently went 5-8 in 13 games without James (groin) and Rajon Rondo (finger). While Ball has shown some promise, he recently suffered a Grade 3 ankle sprain that is expected to keep him sidelined for at least a month. This comes after he was limited to just 52 games as a rookie due to an MCL sprain, among other things. His inability to stay healthy to this point in his career is being viewed as a red flag by some around the Association. "His injuries have really hurt his value," a scout from a Western Conference team told Woike of Ball. Ball is hardly the only young Laker being evaluated by people around the NBA, of course. One Eastern Conference scout believes Kyle Kuzma would fetch Los Angeles the biggest return of all of its potential trade chips, and another source also offered high praise of the second-year forward. "He's been the most consistent from what I've seen," a Western Conference scout told Woike. "He's a legitimate scorer, he's shown the ability to defend, and I think his body will hold up better in the next few years." Brandon Ingram—the second overall pick in the 2016 draft—may be the most polarizing piece of the Lakers' young core, though. One Eastern Conference scout believes Ingram is a better long-term asset than Kuzma, and a Western Conference source believes the 21-year-old forward still has major potential. However, Ingram's toughness, shooting and "average motor" were all questioned. The Athletic's Bill Oram reported Friday that the Lakers are open to dealing Ball, Kuzma, Ingram and others if it will land them a co-star for James. As a result, Magic Johnson and Co. appear to be a group to keep an eye on as the trade deadline approaches.<|im_end|>

# Teaching, a Link Round-Up | GradHacker

Recent GradHacker posts to help you improve your teaching.  By  Graduate students wear a lot of different hats on campus. We are students, mentors, mentees, academics, authors, and teachers. Learning how to balance all of these identities can be difficult, especially when competing expectations pull you in a variety of different directions at once.  When I started out, for example, I had never taught before. And I was thrown into the deep end almost immediately. Nevertheless, I learned—through experience, talking with my peers, and observing my favorite teachers.  Over the last year, the GradHackers have had a lot to say about teaching, pedagogy, and course design. Below is a round-up of our most recent posts on the subject, which I, now a seasoned teacher, found insightful.  Tips for Teaching and Assessing Writing, Brady Krien. Teaching and assessing students’ writing go hand-in-hand. In this post, Brady introduces you to some of the basic principles of composition pedagogy. As he argues, “nothing trains you to write better than learning how to teach it.”  What I Learned in a Pedagogy Course, Ingrid Paredes. Reflecting on her graduate-level course on pedagogy through her university’s Learning Assistant Program, Ingrid writes that “accustomed to lecture-style classes designed for hundreds of students at a time, I didn’t know what to expect” of the course’s “student-centered, active, cooperative learning environment.”  Tuning Your Pedagogical Practice: Universal Design Learning, Neelofer Qadir. In this post on Universal Design Learning, Neelofer demonstrates how designing courses with a variety of access points for a variety of learners can positively impact student learning. She also includes a lot of links to get you started, too.  Tuning Your Pedagogical Practice: Incorporate Digital and Social Technology, Neelofer Qadir. When you are talking about designing undergraduate courses, you cannot avoid talking about the rolls digital and social technology play in them. In this post, Neelofer goes through several ways she has incorporated technology into her courses, including an important discussion on scaffolding.  First Day!, Patrick Bigsby. Teaching can (and should) start before the first day of class. As Patrick shows, falling into the Syllabus Week rut can set a less-than-ideal tone for the rest of the term. Instead, consider “tweaking your first-week routine for a more productive, engaging first day.”  Teach Like You Write, Daniel Korr. Sometimes changing your perspective on teaching can come from something you are already doing, in this case writing a dissertation. Daniel argues that many of the skills you have learned writing and researching could (and should) come to bear on your teaching, too.  What are your teaching insights?

# Top scorer Freddie Ladapo says teamwork is paying off for Argyle

Striker Freddie Ladapo has attributed Plymouth Argyle’s encouraging start to 2019 to a ‘togetherness’ within the team.  The Pilgrims have begun the new year with back-to-back League One wins against Oxford United (3-0) and Southend United (3-2).  While they are still 23rd in the table, Argyle are now only a point from a position of safety.  Ladapo scored the Pilgrims’ second goal in their victory over his former club Southend at Roots Hall on Saturday.  Southend grabbed two very late goals, including a spectacular shot from inside his own half by 17-year-old debutant Charlie Kelman in stoppage time.  However, Argyle were good value for their win as they prevented Southend from building up any pressure by pressing them all over the pitch.  While the scoreline might not have reflected it, it was without doubt one of the Pilgrims’ best displays of the season.  Ladapo said: “We had a lot of confidence. In the last couple of games we have really felt a togetherness.  Plymouth Live Facebook Page  Plymouth Live's extensive Argyle coverage can also be found on our Facebook page, which is updated regularly each day.  Check out here: www.facebook.com/plymouthlivesport.  “I think you can see in the way we press, in the way we attack and even probably in the way we defend.  “We are going more as a team, rather than in the first half of the season where it was mix and match in some weeks.”  Argyle’s high-energy approach against Southend came as they played for the first time in 11 days.  Following their victory over Oxford, the players were given a four-day break by manager Derek Adams after a hectic Christmas period of matches.  Ladapo said: “I think we needed the time off because training is quite hectic at Plymouth. We were all looking forward to it.  “I remember when we had the schedule before the Oxford game that when we saw we were going to get some time off it gave us that boost in the game itself, and we won 3-0.  “What we didn’t want to was not repay the favour and the faith that the manager has shown in us, so we had to make sure we started fast against Southend, and we pressed well.”<|im_end|>

# Osman's return is a sight for Sow eyes

It's not just Osman Sow who is excited to see him back on the football pitch for MK Dons, but his manager and team-mates too.  The Swedish striker's career at Stadium MK has been severely hampered by injuries since he signed in August 2017, limiting him to just 26 appearances. Having made just seven appearances in 2018 heading in to December, Sow has been dripped back into first team competition, making four appearances since December 8 - all of them from the bench. His training schedule has been tinkered in a bid to keep him as fit as possible - something which Sow is thankful for. He said: "I have to say a massive thanks to the backroom staff – Simon and Adam and Tom – now I'm feeling good, taking it one day at a time and trying to improve my sharpness. "I've really enjoyed playing, enjoying the moment and help the team. If I play, if I don't play, just help get the points. "All minutes are valuable for me at the moment, I'm just trying to tick along." Having scored in the 6-0 win over Cambridge on New Year's Day, Sow was a brief substitute against Bury on Saturday before getting 66 minutes in the Development League win over AFC Wimbledon on Monday. Alex Gilbey, who spent six months in the treatment room at the beginning of 2018 with Sow, said: "Osman has worked so hard, he’s had ups and downs, but to see him out there scoring goals is massive – that’s big for him – long may it continue. "It feels brilliant, I built a great relationship with Osman off the pitch, we worked hard together, for him to keep getting knock backs was upsetting to see considering how good he is. Now, he’s feeling the best he’s felt for a few years – I know he’ll score goals for us. "The physios have a thing in place for him, if we can keep him fit and firing, we’ve got a very fit striker on our hands." And should he be able to stay fit, manager Paul Tisdale feels he will have a strong asset on his hands. Tisdale added: "We've not seen much of Osman, but he's more than good enough and hopefully he can stay fit and focused and as wonderful as he has been in the last few months in trying to be the best he can be. I'd be very happy if he does."<|im_end|>

# Jordan Lukaku fallout: What went wrong and where Newcastle United will go next

Rafa Benitez maintained a dignified silence during his weekly press conference after a deal for Lazio defender Jordan Lukaku fell through on Friday afternoon.  Lukaku had flown to Newcastle from Rome and checked into the Hilton hotel ahead of a medical and the other usual formalities surrounding a temporary deal.  Despite reports in Italy, which suggest that the Lukaku deal collapsed because of financial reasons, sources on Tyneside insist that wages and fees weren't an issue and had been agreed in principle.  The Magpies, however, wanted to take a closer look at Lukaku's fitness and the left-sided player failed a medical on Friday, hence Benitez's silence before the FA Cup clash with Watford.  Lukaku has played just 231 minutes for Lazio this season but missed the start of the campaign due to inflamed ligaments of the knee missing 14 games for the Serie A side.  He made just 10 starts in Serie A last in the 2017/18 season and missed some games with knee inflammation.  Lukaku has also suffered from hamstring and ankle injuries in the past and missed 10 games in the 2016/17 campaign.  But ultimately, the brother of Manchester United star Romelu, failed the medical and the fitness demands of the tests United put in front of him on Friday and the club didn't want to take any risks.  Benitez clearly had an inkling that something wasn't right on Friday afternoon but chose to focus on the game against Watford.  The rushed loan deal of Islam Slimani last season, which cost them over £1million for a loan fee to Leicester plus wages, was still fresh in the minds of Newcastle chiefs.  Lukaku's failed move has left the door wide open for more criticism and the general consensus around the city is that Newcastle have left things too late once again in January.  Newcastle have now turned back to Monaco's left-back Antonio Barreca - who the club spoke to at the start of the week.  A deal was agreed with Thierry Henry but has since been sacked and replaced by former Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim.  United re-entered the talks for Barreca soon after they learned Lukaku had failed his medical.  A short statement was released by United on Friday night reading: "Newcastle United can confirm that Jordan Lukaku will not be joining the club.  "The Belgian defender was on Tyneside on Friday after being given permission to travel by his current club, SS Lazio. "It has now been decided that a loan deal will not be pursued and the player will return to Rome.  "We wish Jordan all the best for the future."<|im_end|>

# 'Stieg Larsson: The Man Who Played with Fire': Film Review | Sundance 2019

'Stieg Larsson: The Man Who Played with Fire': Film Review | Sundance 2019  Henrik Georgsson's doc delivers a biographical portait of the author of the 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' trilogy who spent much of his career investigating extreme right-wing organizations.  Most people are familiar with Stieg Larsson through his hugely successful Girl with the Dragon Tattoo novels and their subsequent Swedish and Hollywood film adaptations. But while Henrik Georgsson's documentary about Larsson's life and career riffs on the title of one those best-sellers, it concentrates on the far more fascinating story of the author's decades-long journalistic efforts exposing European neo-Nazis and right-wing extremists. Receiving its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, Stieg Larsson: The Man Who Played with Fire will have no problem garnering interest among international audiences.  "He should be known for his consistent job of mapping out the far right and the Nazis," a commentator says early on about Larsson in the film. It's a situation the documentary attempts to rectify, delivering a biographical portrait in which the Millennium crime novels revolving around Lisbeth Salander are little more than a footnote.  Larsson reported on the subject for decades, starting his career at as a graphic artist for a news agency before segueing into written journalism. In the documentary, Eva Gabrielsson, described as his "life companion," attests to how he worked tirelessly, largely subsisting on junk food, coffee and cigarettes. It was a lifestyle that no doubt contributed to his 2004 death from a heart attack at age 50.  It was a dangerous beat, especially since Larsson took such steps as joining the neo-Nazi organization Nordic Realm Party under an assumed name so he could receive their literature. The film chronicles the political turbulence that led to the rise of right-wing elements in Sweden in the 1980s and '90s, including the founding of the "Keep Sweden Swedish" anti-immigrant organization and the 1986 assassination of former prime minister Olof Palme, then the leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party.  Director Georgsson, whose previous credits include such television series as The Bridge and Wallender, uses a combination of archival footage, contemporary interviews and dramatic recreations to recount Larsson's story. It includes such dramatic episodes as Larsson and his co-author Anna-Lena Lodenius delivering a lecture promoting their book about right-wing extremists to an audience packed with white supremacists. While he was editor of Expo, a magazine dedicated to investigating such groups, he and his fellow journalists were regularly the object of threats. Those dangers apparently continue to this day, since several of the journalists interviewed in the film are shown with their identities hidden.  Even while he was working full-time as a journalist, Larsson wrote his three novels known as the Millennium trilogy; according to Gabrielsson, the project was an "outlet" for him. A colleague recalls how he thought it was "amateurish" that Larsson had written three books on spec, until Larsson told him that he had already received a large advance.  The dramatic recreations, featuring a Larsson look-alike actor wearing the author's signature round, wire-rimmed glasses, are the film's weakest, most distracting elements. As several commentators describe how Larsson ignored his health, we see a scene of him voraciously eating a greasy sandwich at his desk. And the account of Larsson's death is accompanied by a foreboding shot of the actor struggling to walk up a flight of stairs. They're moments more suited to tabloid television than a feature documentary.  Despite its occasional missteps, however, Stieg Larsson: The Man Who Played with Fire packs an undeniable, and especially timely, punch. Its relevance is made dramatically clear in vintage footage from a televised interview in which Larsson, asked about the state of the world, presciently and ominously declares, "Democracy is threatened."

# Do You Qualify For An Earned Income Tax Credit? Online Tax Tools and Information Can Help You Decide

The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a program designed to provide tax relief for American workers with low-paying jobs. Could you qualify for this tax credit? If you have a relatively low income, take some time to find out.  Earned Income Tax Credit Qualification  Some eligible taxpayers miss out on EITC savings because they have no taxes withheld and think that they cannot possibly qualify. However, EITC is a refundable tax credit, meaning that even if you owe no taxes you may be eligible to get money back — as long as you file a tax return. You cannot qualify if you do not file. But if you do file, and owe no taxes, you may get a check from Uncle Sam anyway!  To claim this credit, you must meet certain requirements. First, you must have earned income. Generally, this refers to wages, salaries, tips or self-employment income. Other earned income sources include long-term disability benefits (if you are below the minimum retirement age) and union strike benefits. Unemployment benefits such as alimony, child support, interest/dividends, and Social Security benefits do not count as earned income. Non-taxable combat pay may be classified either way — seek professional advice in that situation. You must also have a valid Social Security number and be a U.S. citizen or resident alien, and you cannot be claimed as a qualifying child of another taxpayer.  Next, your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) must be below a series of scaled limits based on filing status and the number of qualifying children that you have. A qualifying child must be a close relative (child, grandchild, stepchild, or adopted child) and younger than nineteen years of age (or 24 if a full-time student). Foster children also qualify. Details are available here. Note that only one person can claim the same child. This may cause trouble among separated or divorced parents and can put the IRS in the position to determine who can rightfully claim the credit.  AGIs are found on line 7 of Form 1040. In tax year 2018 (to be filed by April 15, 2019) for single filers, heads of household, or widowers, the AGI limit is $15,270 with no qualifying children, $40,320 for one child, $45,802 for two, and $49,194 with three or more. For married filing jointly status, the corresponding limits are $20,950, $46,010, $51,492, and $54,884, respectively. The corresponding maximum tax credits range from $519 with no qualifying children to $6,431 with three or more qualifying children.  You can get a rough idea of whether you qualify for the EITC by using an estimator from the IRS itself. For further information, consult the IRS EITC webpage. Make sure that the information relates to the correct tax year — the IRS is not always diligent in updating the status of their pages to reflect the current tax year and recent changes.  Do not let fear of tax forms stop you from claiming a tax credit that you deserve. Many people who qualify for EITC also qualify for the IRS Free File program or volunteer assistance at IRS centers. Besides, by definition, if you qualify for the EITC, you are very much in need of the financial assistance that it can provide.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made no direct changes to the EITC. However, the tax brackets are now adjusted according to the Chained Consumer Price Index (C-CPI) for Urban Consumers, which grows at a slower rate than the previous inflation measure. As a result, the EITC will now also increase more slowly than it would have under the previous tax law.  Get help evaluating your status if you need it, but in any case, be sure to see if you qualify for the EITC. Says Betterment Head of Tax Eric Bronnenkant, "Credits are, in general, more valuable than deductions, because they reduce your taxes dollar for dollar." Collect all the savings that you deserve.  Failing to pay your taxes or a penalty you owe could negatively impact your credit score. You can check your credit score and read your credit report for free within minutes by joining MoneyTips.

# September Mourning Release 'Glass Animals' Video

(Tag) September Mourning have released a music video for their newest single, "Glass Animals" ahead of their new graphic novel and tour with Smile Empty Soul. We were sent the following details: "'Glass Animals' is about the fragmented soul. It's about the realization that we are all broken. Something or someone has broken us and within that broken state we ultimately find the strength to survive. Musically, it's a little bit of a tribute to one of our favorite bands: The Deftones. The song ties into the comic book as well.... Hannah is a broken soul who, through the help of September and Claire, finds the strength to face her personal demons and live again." - Emily Lazar (Founder) Shortly after Glass Animals drops, Image Comics is releasing September Mourning The Complete Collection co-created by Lazar and Marc Silvestri, co-written by Mariah McCourt and David Hine, illustrated by Sumeyye Kesgin and Tina Valentino and published by Top Cow. "In a world where Reapers prey on the souls of the living, imprisoning them in the shadow-land of Mortem, there is one last hope for humanity.... September Mourning" describes Lazar. The graphic novel will be sold in comic stores, books stores (Barnes & Noble) nationwide and on Amazon. To support the release of the graphic novel and new music, September Mourning will be hitting the road, supporting Smile Empty Soul. Before and after the dates, the band will also be doing a handful of headline shows that will be announced soon.

# Sabarimala verdict: With lone woman judge on medical leave, SC may not start hearing on review pleas from January 22

Sabarimala verdict: With lone woman judge on medical leave, SC may not start hearing on review pleas from January 22  The observation came after lawyer Mathews J Nedumpara sought live streaming of hearing on the petitions seeking review of the apex court's verdict allowing all women inside Sabarimala Temple. NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Tuesday said it may not start the hearing from January 22 on pleas seeking review of the Sabarimala verdict, as one of the judges is on medical leave.  A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that Justice Indu Malhotra, the lone woman judge of the five-judge constitution bench which had delivered the verdict in the Sabarimala case is on leave on medical grounds.  "Justice Indu Malhotra is on leave due to some medical reasons," the bench said.  The bench, which also comprised Justices L Nageswara Rao and S K Kaul, said that the hearing, which is scheduled to start from January 22, may not take place.  The observation came after lawyer Mathews J Nedumpara mentioned the case and sought live streaming of hearing on the petitions seeking review of the apex court's verdict allowing all women inside Sabarimala temple, on January 22.  The Supreme Court had on September 28 last year said that banning the entry of women into the shrine is gender discrimination and the practice violates rights of Hindu women.<|im_end|>

# Does Plibersek’s pledge to raise the teaching ATAR make sense?

As Tanya Plibersek promised to raise required high school scores for aspiring teachers, countless practicing teachers around the country shook our heads in disbelief.  There is no way Plibersek, the federal Shadow Minister for Education, could be under any illusion that there is research to support the notion of higher ATARs (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) creating better teachers. For someone apparently so committed to academic standards, she has not offered a shred evidence that raising the required marks for teaching degrees to the top 30% of school leavers will actually improve the quality of teaching in schools.<|im_end|>

# Opinion | Alzheimer’s: The warning signs

Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive, degenerative disease of the brain which continues to have a significant and growing impact on seniors. There is a difference between normal age-related forgetfulness and Alzheimer-type memory loss.  To help you know what to look for, the Alzheimer Society of Canada has developed a list of 10 warning signs:  Memory loss affecting daily abilities  It’s normal to occasionally forget where you put your keys. But a person suffering with Alzheimer's forgets what keys are used for.

# Syracuse signee Joe Girard III scores 109 points in two games, 44 in a half

Future Syracuse Joe Girard III continued to score points at a ridiculous pace for Glens Falls High School last week, piling up 109 points in two wins. According to the Glens Falls Post-Star, Girard scored 53 points in a 100-63 win over South Glens Falls early in the week. He followed that up with 56 points in a 94-67 win over Broadalbin-Perth on Friday. The performances gave Girard, a 6-foot-1 combination guard, four consecutive games with at least 50 points. Perhaps the most astounding number came in the Friday game against Broadalbin-Perth, when Girard, according to the Albany Times-Union, piled up a very Syracuse-friendly 44 points in the first half. That included knocking down 10 3-pointers. The game was a nice response to the South Glens Falls when Girard had, by his lofty standards, a pedestrian game from the 3-point line. He made five but was just 2-for-8 in the first half. Girard set the record for most points scored by a New York boys high school player last February. He broke the record for girls and boys in December. He continues to raise his mark with each impressive performance this season. Girard’s Glens Falls team is now 10-1 and ranked No. 5 in Class B in the state. A three-star recruit, Girard will face a steep increase in the degree of difficulty when he joins the Orange next year. Still, his results at the high school level are fun to follow. He is expected to be part of a freshman class next season that also features guard Brycen Goodine, forward Quincy Guerrier and center John Bol Ajak.<|im_end|>

# San Diego Safari Park: Baby Giraffe Kumi Euthanized After Likely Being Gored by Antelope

San Diego Safari Park: Baby Giraffe Kumi Euthanized After Likely Being Gored by Antelope  A 5-month-old male giraffe born at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park was euthanized near the end of December after being gored in the stomach, probably by an antelope, said zoo spokeswoman Christina Simmons.  The giraffe, named Kumi, was born Aug. 6, 2018. He was in good health until he was discovered the morning of Dec. 29 with the gore wound. A veterinary assessment found that the wound couldn’t be treated, Simmons said, so animal care staff made the difficult decision to put him down.  The zoo announced Kumi’s passing in a statement posted Friday on Facebook.  The incident highlights the dangers that animals can encounter, even in a managed habitat, if they are to have any of the natural experiences they would have in the wild.

# Fire in the home: what you and your kids need to do to stay safe

FAYETTE COUNTY, WV (WOAY)-  It’s something you never think will happen to you. A fire starting small, then spreading rapidly throughout your home, destroying your house and putting your life in danger.  That’s what happened to two houses in southern West Virginia this weekend. A Clay County home was in flames, claiming the lives of four foster children. Over in Beckley, a house fire killed a man.  Now our local fire departments and schools are stressing fire safety when it comes to our kids.  “The main thing is to have a fire escape plan and have at least two ways out of your house,” Fayetteville fireman Matt Milam said, who’s been on countless fire calls but also has family to worry about- and he’s put a plan in place…and into practice.  Over at Rosedale Elementary School in Oak Hill- teacher Eleanor Gandee has practiced eight fire drills with her first graders this year. Every student also has a fire safety bag.  Students have been taught if they are at home and hear the smoke alarm go off, they have to know what they’re supposed to do and where to go.<|im_end|>

# West Michigan investment group buys downtown GR building for $4M - MiBiz: West Michigan Business News

GRAND RAPIDS — A private investment group has purchased a downtown commercial office building at 61 Commerce Ave. SW for $4 million, MiBiz has learned. An investment group affiliated with Byron Center-based E5 Ventures LLC bought the five-story, 28,245-square-foot commercial office building from ProCare Corporate Headquarters LLC. The transaction closed on Jan. 14. The building currently serves as ProCare Pain Solutions’ headquarters, and the buyer plans to have the company remain a tenant, said Kevin Schafer, controller at E5 Ventures, which will manage the property. “We hope ProCare stays for a long, long, long time,” he told MiBiz. Schafer said the investment group has no plans to make changes at the building, which it bought as an investment. He declined to say more about the group. The building was built in 1890. ProCare purchased it for $750,000 in 2007 and remodeled the building in the following year, according to property records. Founded in 1994, ProCare serves as a practice management consultant for various health care institutions. The company spun out of Michigan Pain Consultants PC, according to its website. The company did not respond to a request for comment at the time this report went to press. The sale-leaseback deal comes as office vacancy rates in the overall downtown market stand at below 10 percent, according to the latest market report from the West Michigan office of Colliers International. The company will release updated statistics on Jan. 31 as part of its annual 2019 West Michigan economic and commercial real estate forecast. According to a report released this month by South Bend, Ind.-based Bradley Co., which in October acquired X Ventures and moved into the Grand Rapids market, an influx of new construction and renovation projects also has started to affect the downtown office market. In particular, lease rates for new construction projects have begun to level off, according to the company. Since 2016, more than 1.6 million square feet of office space has been added to the market. Several more projects are due to be completed in Grand Rapids in 2019, ultimately serving to lower lease rates because of the added supply, according to the report.<|im_end|>

# Armed men loot Rs 2 lakh from Gurgaon farmhouse

Armed men broke into a farmhouse in Gurgaon on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday and robbed its occupants of cash and goods worth around Rs 2,00,000.  According to the FIR, the crime took place at a farmhouse in Ansal Aravali, which had been rented by property dealer Jitendra Thakran, a Sector 46 resident. In his complaint, Thakran stated that he was staying at his farmhouse on Saturday night with his wife and staff.  “Around 12:05 am, four or five armed people broke in and took me, my staff, and a colleague hostage at gunpoint, and beat us up,” he alleged, adding that the men then forcefully took the keys to his Maruti S-Cross car, which was parked in the porch.  The complainant has also alleged the theft of his wallet, which had Rs 45,000 and some “important documents”, and Rs 10,000 that was kept in his wife’s purse, along with an “expensive watch” she was wearing. The perpetrators also allegedly took Rs 13,000, a gold chain, two gold rings, and a watch, from his staff, along with the six phones that belonged to the occupants.  “We have registered a case under various sections of the IPC and the Arms Act.

# Some 70,000 Brussels protesters demand action on climate

BRUSSELS — At least 70,000 people braved cold and rain in Brussels on Sunday to demand the Belgian government and the European Union increase their efforts to fight climate change, the Belgian capital’s fourth climate rally in two months to attract at least 10,000 participants. The event was described as Belgium’s biggest climate march ever, with police estimating slightly bigger crowds than a similar demonstration last month. Trains from across the nation were so clogged that thousands of people didn’t make the march in time. Some 35,000 students in Belgium skipped classes Thursday to take their demands for urgent action to prevent global warming to the streets. “Young people have set a good example,” protester Henny Claassen said amid raised banners urging better renewable energy use and improved air quality. “This is for our children, for our grandchildren, and to send a message to politicians.” Even though the direct impact on Belgian politics was likely to be small since the country currently is led by a caretaker government, the demonstrations have pushed the issue of climate change up the agenda as parties prepare for national and European Union elections in May. The march ended at the headquarters of the European Union. The 28-nation bloc has been at the vanguard of global efforts to counter climate change but still came in for the protesters’ criticism. “Society as a whole could do a lot more because they’re saying ‘Yes, we’re doing a lot,’ but they’re doing not that much. They could do a lot more,” demonstrator Pieter Van Der Donckt said. Citizen activism on climate change Sunday was not limited to Belgium. Thousands of people made human chains or held other climate events around France. In Paris, there was a debate inspired by a recent petition for legal action to force the government to set more ambitious goals for reducing carbon emissions that create global warming. President Emmanuel Macron sees himself as a climate crusader, but suffered a serious setback when fuel tax increases meant to help wean France off fossil fuels backfired dramatically, unleashing the yellow vest protests now in their third month. —— Associated Press writers Daniela Berretta in Brussels and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.<|im_end|>

# Port of Tyne set to axe 40 driver jobs as it closes distribution arm

Port of Tyne is making 40 of its drivers redundant after deciding to close its external haulage business.  Historically, the firm has operated a separate logistics business that handled goods that were not shipped through the port.  The strategy was unusual in the market, with the majority of ports only operating logistic services for goods that are imported to their main site. Port of Tyne has now followed suit and is closing its external distribution arm.  The move will lead to 40 drivers being made redundant, although a number of workers will be offered new positions within the company.  In a statement issued to The Journal, Port of Tyne said its vision is to grow its core business areas of automotive logistics, bulk and conventional cargo handling, cruise and ferry services, estates and port-centric logistics, focused around container specific transport and warehousing.  A spokesperson said: “Substantial challenges within the transport distribution market have resulted in the Port making the strategic decision to withdraw from the provision of ‘distribution only’ transport.  “This decision follows a business review and is in no way connected to Brexit.  “The Port will continue to drive container growth and deliver associated warehousing services by developing that section of the business in line with the growth strategy.”  It added that by offering a port-centric approach, the Port would continue to support an increasing number of UK shippers, retailers and manufacturers who are switching their container import gateway from the congestion of the South of England.  A Port spokesman went on to say that the business will create new opportunities within its container fleet, limiting the impact to around 40 jobs, and every effort will be made to support and assist affected employees.  The news comes just a week after Port of Tyne appointed Matt Beeton as its new chief executive officer.  Mr Beeton took up his new position on January 7 with a vision to double the company’s value by 2022.  The new CEO has more than 20 years’ experience in the transport industry and has previously held positions at Rolls Royce, Bombardier, Serco Plc, Northern Rail and National Express. He joined from transport consultancy firm APT Business Solutions.<|im_end|>

# Four Ways Business Leaders Can Harness the $500 Million Data Literacy Opportunity

“Corporate data literacy cannot be achieved based on having a number of skilled individuals”  The uncertainty around Brexit and the country’s poor performance on productivity growth is a black cloud looming over the UK.  Seizing new opportunities in such an environment has never been more important, writes Jordan Morrow, Global Head of Data Literacy, Qlik.  But how can British businesses be truly equipped to take every opportunity for growth and innovation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution?  The key lies in equipping employees – at all levels – to confidently interpret data for stronger business outcomes.  This is not just about upskilling in today’s analytics economy. This is about increasing enterprise value, and our research has found that businesses with a greater levels of corporate data literacy – the ability to read, work with, analyse and argue with data throughout the organisation – have a 3-5% higher enterprise value, a potential increase for large enterprises of between $320 and $534 million. Furthermore, it improves other metrics of corporate performance, including productivity and gross margin.  Businesses could be doing a lot more to harness this half a billion-dollar opportunity, with four critical areas holding many back. Those that wish to capitalise on the potential improvements to corporate performance should consider these key recommendations:  1: Ensure Data Literacy is at the Heart of the Business  Corporate data literacy cannot be achieved based on having a number of skilled individuals. While an important component, our research found that two further dimensions were critical to reap its benefits: making sure that data is distributed throughout the business and that people have the authority to make data-driven decisions in their role.  While grassroots initiatives can be a great driver of data literacy initiatives in the business, this brings to the fore the important role of business leaders in ensuring that data literacy is at the heart of the company. This means putting in place the training, processes and infrastructure to enable data-empowered employees.  2: Bring Data Literacy to Everyone  It isn’t enough for just the IT or business intelligence team to have access to their data. Putting data into the hands of employees at all levels and in all roles enables them to make more informed, better decisions – whether that’s managing available beds in a hospital, or in product design.  Large organisations should consider having a Chief Data Officer that sits out the IT function, tasked with democratising data access across the business. When supported by data analysis and visualisation tools, everyone can improve their decision-making skills by learning to ask the right questions from their data, interpret their findings, and take informed action.  3: Be Ready to Change  While nearly all business leaders acknowledge that data is important to their industry and in how their company currently makes decisions, businesses aren’t adapting to take advantage of data to improve that decision making.  In fact, only 8% of firms have made major changes in the way the data is used in the last 5 years. This means that even companies with data literate employees across every business unit are not turning data into useable information as effectively as possible.  Business leaders must adapt their decision-making processes to empower and enable employees to harness the true value from their data.  4: Invest in a Culture of Data Literacy  78% of employees are willing to invest more time and energy into improving their data skillsets. However, when surveyed, just 17% of business leaders reported that their companies “significantly encourage” employees to become more comfortable with data.  Business leaders resoundingly understand the importance of data literacy, with two-thirds of companies are planning on hiring more data literate employees. But, with just 24% of the global workforce being fully confident in their ability to read, work with, analyse and communicate with data, hiring external talent isn’t enough.  Business leaders must more invest in their own workforce with data literacy training, with just one-third of firms currently offering data literacy training. This needn’t be great sums on external trainers, as many free educational resources can be found on the Data Literacy Project. But they should invest in giving their employees the additional capacity to gain a better understanding of data and explore the opportunities for it to transform their own tasks.  Data literacy has become a necessity and a requirement for everyone in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Data will become the second language of business, empowering and enabling employees to make better decisions and perform better in their roles.  With a half a billion-dollar opportunity on the table, business leaders can’t afford to overlook the potential of having a more data literate organisation. These four recommendations are an essential starting point for any company looking to capitalise on this immense economic opportunity.<|im_end|>

# Vodafone’s iconic pug gone without a farewell hug

Last week Vodafone-Idea released a new ‘network’ ad, done by O&M. The ad shows two engineers tinkering away in a dimly-lit highway tunnel. One tells the other, “What’s the point of working in these conditions if people will only watch cat videos and not really know or remember us after all the hard work we’ve put?”. The older engineer turns around with a twinkle in his eyes and says, “We do this so people don’t remember us.”  The new commercial takes the thought of a data-strong network to the next level with #StrongerEveryHour, by adding that Voda-Idea are adding a tower every hour.  This is a sea-change from a year ago when Vodafone brought its mascot, the lovable pug, back into its advertising, while opting to convey the message of #StrongerTogether. The merger with Idea had yet not been completed then and Vodafone chose to push the message of a data-strong network using symbolism loved by all: an army of pugs following a boy through a street, symbolic of the network that follows you.  The new ad with the engineers however points to a sad reality: the cute, little pug has been bid good-bye by the merged entity.  Vodafone introduced Cheeka, the pug, in 2003. Many great renditions of the pug have been seen ever since. One cannot be sure if this strategic shift away from the pug is the result of a management decision at Voda-Idea to jettison brand values of both the earlier avatars of the merged entity and forge an identity completely different from imagery attached to either brand in the past. Or, the pug has been exited because of the adverse PR generated by the PETA controversy on the last pugs ad wherein the NGO gunned at the telecom operator alleging pain and torture in the shooting of the animals and labeling them ‘vulnerable’. Or, that Vodafone globally has decided not to use animals in its advertising, under pressure from consumer groups, especially in Europe.  Vodafone had run afoul of the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland for its infamous ‘Bull’ ad in 2016, and ever since the global telecom giant has largely stayed away from showing animals in its advertising.  Whatever be the reasons, the cute-ness associated with Vodafone advertising is gone. Vodafone advertising always had a certain attitude, a certain slickness that distinguished it from competition. It wasn’t stiff-upper-lip. It wasn’t just city-smart. It had class while still being mass. It had swag. It had charm. It had sophistication. It was cool.  With the pug gone, will the zoo-zoos die too? The zoo-zoos were introduced in 2008 during IPL 2. Ironically, Vodafone received the first People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) 2009 Glitterbox Award, for replacing the pug with more humane alternatives in their ads.  PETA was of course not to know then that the pug had just been granted temporary leave-of-absence and that the zoo-zoos would only make a tactical appearance every year at IPL time while the pug would continue to be a constant ambassador for network goodness for years to come.  But it will be interesting to see whether the zoo-zoos will resurface this year when the IPL commences in mid-March. Chances are they won’t. Because Voda-Idea is not Vodafone. It is a different company; it is a company that is distancing itself from all of the past of its two merged brands: good or bad.  The new Voda-Idea commercial is actually an attempt at wry humour vaguely reminiscent of past Idea advertising. Not exactly the same, but in the same mould. But honestly, while the engineers may be good PR for the company’s HR policies of recognizing the contribution of employees, and publicly acknowledging it, it does very little for the ‘new’ Voda-Idea brand. Because it lacks any differentiation. It is manufacturer-speak, no more. Yes, a tower-every-hour. But, so what?  I would really feel sad if the pug is put into retirement. It would be the end of an era. An era in advertising when brands would create and support break-through ideas. An era where the creative idea scored over tech-talk about towers, signal strength, research tests and more. An era when Cheeka was the darling of the country and every small boy and girl wanted a pug for a pet, including mine.

# Letter: Slow snow removal frustrating - BC Local News

Why are the roads in my subdivision out Westside Road not plowed for people who have to work?  We received a good four inches of snow. The one neighbor is plowing the road on his quad. Another neighbor is doing circles around the subdivision in a pickup truck making tracks for people. There is something wrong with the snow plow company that they can’t make peoples’ drive to work safe.  The ambulance has been stuck in my subdivision before and a helicopter had to fly the patient out. This is unacceptable.  People expect the roads to be plowed in a timely manner. Sometimes the plow doesn’t come until the day after it snows. Maybe ICBC wouldn’t be so broke if they plowed in a more timely fashion.  Sharon Schnurr<|im_end|>

# Southwest cancels 40 flights for engine inspections after last week’s deadly accident

Southwest cancels 40 flights for engine inspections after last week’s deadly accident  Southwest Airlines says it has canceled roughly 1 percent of its scheduled flights as it carries out inspections prompted by an engine failure that led to a passenger’s death last week. About 40 flights were affected.  The affected Southwest Boeing 737 took off Tuesday morning from New York, headed for Dallas. About 20 minutes into the flight, at about 32,500 feet, a fan blade broke off the engine and shrapnel shattered a window.  Jennifer Riordan, 43, and a mother of two, was almost sucked out of the broken window and pulled back inside by fellow passengers. She died from blunt force trauma at a hospital after the plane’s emergency landing in Philadelphia.  After the incident, Southwest Airlines said it was accelerating its existing engine inspection program relating to the CFM56 engine family “out of an abundance of caution” over the following 30 days.  In a statement Sunday it said that its flight cancellations had been minimal.  “We have minimized flight disruptions this past week through actions such as proactive aircraft routings to cover open trips, performing inspections overnight, and utilizing spare aircraft, when available. On Sunday, we only canceled about 40 flights due to fan blade inspections out of a planned schedule of almost 4,000 flights,” the airline said.  Southwest said its cancellations were the result of a “voluntary, accelerated engine fan blade inspection program” rather than inspections ordered by US and European aviation authorities. It recommended customers check their flights’ status on its website.  Inspections ordered  The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) each issued an emergency airworthiness directive on Friday requiring airlines to perform an ultrasonic inspection of certain CFM56-7B engines within 20 days.  The FAA and EASA directives came on the same day that the engine manufacturer, CFM International, issued a service bulletin recommending the CFM56-7B engine be inspected more frequently.  “CFM recommends ultrasonic inspections within the next 20 days to fan blades of CFM56-7B engines with more than 30,000 cycles since new,” it said. “Also, it recommends inspections by the end of August for fan blades with 20,000 cycles, and inspections to all other fan blades when they reach 20,000 cycles.”  After reaching a certain age, the engines should be inspected approximately every two years, the manufacturer said.  According to CFM International, about 680 engines will be impacted by the order to inspect engines with more than 30,000 cycles within the next 20 days. More than 150 of those have already been checked by operators, it said.  Another 2,500 engines will be impacted by the recommendation to inspect fan blades with 20,000 cycles by the end of August, CFM International said. A jet engine cycle comprises an engine start, takeoff and landing, and full shut down.  “The inspection, conducted on-wing with an ultrasonic probe along the surface of the fan blade, takes about four hours per engine,” the manufacturer said.  US federal safety investigators have said the naked eye cannot detect the cracks and signs of metal fatigue that doomed the engine on Southwest Flight 1380.<|im_end|>

# After Viral Story, Man Tries Wine In A Pringles Can | Mix 94.1

They say before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. Following this sage advice, a writer for Food & Wine picked up a bottle of red and a Pringles can in an effort to recreate the viral sensation from over the weekend. 
If you were paying attention to the news, you probably heard a woman was busted at a Walmart for imbibing from the potato chip container, which earned her a ban at the shopping giant’s stores. 
But does it work? Turns out, very much so, according to Mike Pomranz, who notes that the Pringles can holds the exact volume as a bottle of wine. 
Pomranz suggests that you don’t even need to start by washing out the chip residue before pouring your bottle and you won’t have to worry much about leakage, as the can is surprisingly watertight. What steps have you tried to conceal your alcohol in public?<|im_end|>

# Sneaky ways stores like H&M, Zara, and Uniqlo get you to spend more money on clothes

\nH&amp;M, Zara, Uniqlo, Forever 21, and Fashion Nova all rely on the lucrative business model of fast fashion.&nbsp;\nFast fashion allows stores to continuously sell a high volume of clothes for cheap prices &mdash; in other words, clothes are made for immediate consumption, rather than for long-term wear.&nbsp;\nOur brain chemistry makes it difficult to resist low prices. The brain gets pleasure from new items, but also experiences pain when it considers losing money.\nH&amp;M outsources most of its labor overseas, to countries like Bangladesh, where the working conditions are difficult to oversee.\n\nDaniel: So like Cardi B says, \u0027I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks, right?\nNarrator: Wish you could have the shoes that look like socks? Well, if you don\u0027t wanna spend $770 you can head over to Zara and get something pretty similar for about 60 bucks. Chances are, your closet probably has some H&amp;M logos in it.\nH&amp;M isn\u0027t alone: retailers like Zara, Forever 21, Fashion Nova, Uniqlo, and so many more all fit the definition of fast fashion. The fashion industry is one of the largest industries in the world, and it\u0027s growing. Why is it so easy to buy cheap clothes at stores like H&amp;M? Well it turns out, part of that irresistibly is in our brain chemistry.\nTraditionally, the fashion industry has been organized into two clearly defined seasons: autumn winter, and spring summer. Fast fashion emerged in the late \u002770s and early \u002780s, at a time when trends became much more sought-after. Technology started advancing, manufacturing was outsourced overseas, and synthetic fabrics started to be incorporated a lot more into clothing. The original idea was simple: make runway fashion cheap, and available as soon as possible.\nResearchers define fast fashion as a marketing tool to drive retail footfall. It allows retailers to make up-to-date product offers to their customer base frequently. Retailers create demand with a constant flood of new items. Fast fashion functions &nbsp;like this: designers travel to fashion shows and closely monitor platforms like Instagram, then immediately send off photos to get modeled. Materials get sourced and made overseas, stores get stocked, and H&amp;M can do this process all internally, and all under a week.\nThe only way fast fashion can turn a profit is if they sell a ton of clothes, which they do. H&amp;M\u0027s yearly sales in 2017 were $25 billion, and their CEO\u0027s net worth is $1.9 billion. In order for consumers to return and keep purchasing, the clothes need to be cycled through quickly, rather than invested in for long-term wear. It is for immediate consumption. It is to capture the look of the moment. It is not to linger in the wardrobe. So, back to Cardi B and the shoes that look like socks.\nDaniel: So you go and you get the Balenciagas that look like socks.\nNarrator: That\u0027s Daniel. Daniel went from the world of high fashion to combating the effects the industry is having on the planet.\nDaniel: Everything is made from textile waste, and all of the other products in the store are made from recycled materials. So you go and you get the Balenciagas that look like socks, and it\u0027s only making money for the brand and the endorser. It\u0027s not functioning the way it used to, which was to buy into a brand because of the value, or the quality. It\u0027s buying into a trend to make money.\nNarrator: Following trends is a uniquely human trait, and fast fashion retailers know that. That\u0027s why when you go into an H&amp;M, all the designs seem new, and freshly updated. Unfortunately, it\u0027s impossible to ignore what\u0027s going on behind the scenes. Over the past few decades, fast fashion retailers have been accused of exploiting developing countries for cheap labor, cheap materials, and poor regulation of working conditions. In 2018, the rights group Global Labor Justice released a report detailing allegations of threats and abuse at Asian factories that supply clothes for Gap and H&amp;M.\nIn a statement, H&amp;M said:\nThis report clearly shows the need of continuously addressing these issues. The empowerment of women, economically and socially, is a way to prevent gender-based violence. Our position is very clear, and we actively support such development within the global textile industry. We do this by working to enable freedom of association, strengthening workers\u0027 voices, and the right to join or form a trade union, as well as bargain collectively. \nSo, why does this keep happening almost every year?&nbsp;\nAnita: The bigger issue for fast fashion is that you have factories, suppliers, sub-contractors, sub-sub-contractors. And so the question is When you look at a global supply chain, how can a major brand know that the laws in a local jurisdiction are being respected? That\u0027s the bigger problem.\nNarrator: Combine a poor ability to &nbsp;regulate working conditions and synthetic materials, and you can start to understand how a T-shirt can cost so little. The problem is, our brains have a really difficult time looking past a slashed price tag. A study done by researchers at Carnegie Mellon revealed that subjects who were presented items at discounted prices revealed reactions in three parts of the brain. When you consider buying something, the brain gets pleasure from anticipating a new item, but also experiences pain when considering the loss of money. However, when the price is low, there is almost no pain. So while it may feel good to get deals at H&amp;M, the low prices help us forget the frequent news headlines, and in the end, we\u0027re already thinking about what we need next. Naturally, this yearlong shopping season is creating a lot of waste. The culture of trendy fashion leaves 14 million tons of textile waste in landfills each year.\nDaniel: It\u0027s impossible for an entire item of clothing to be completely made from start to finish for the prices that things are sold for. It changes the consumer\u0027s perspective on the value of things, so it makes things that have a healthy value and a healthy appreciation for themselves, exclusionary. Fast fashion isn\u0027t sustainable, because sustainability inherently means something you\u0027re able to maintain doing at a certain rate or level. If we continue to demand new materials, and produce waste materials and byproducts at the rate that we\u0027re doing it, it will have catastrophic effects on the environment, worse than it already has.\nNarrator: When things are cheap, we tend not to really care about them as much, or how they got here, or where they eventually end up.\nAnita: Consumers need to educate themselves and when the price tag is really low they should be asking the question: Why is it so low? Again, people live on budgets, we understand that. But the question is: Is there a strong human rights policy behind that? And I think the larger issue for fast fashion is rather than saying I need 10 T-shirts at H&amp;M and I\u0027m gonna buy one and throw it out And not be sustainable as a consumer That I\u0027m maybe gonna invest a little bit more, and buy less So there\u0027s really just an issue of responsible consumption And responsible buying.\nNarrator: However, H&amp;M says that it\u0027s moving toward a more sustainable future. According to its 2017 Sustainability Report, the company\u0027s goal is to be climate positive by 2040. So what does this mean? Well, for starters, it hopes to use 100% recycled or other sustainably-sourced materials by 2030, and move to a toxic-free fashion future. When asked for a statement, H&amp;M directed me to its sustainability blog, which provides frequent updates on its efforts. So, what next? Well, at the risk of sounding cliche, real change comes first from the individual, but if you\u0027re like me, it\u0027s pretty hard to justify spending 100 dollars on a white t-shirt. With all things considered, it\u0027s up to consumers to choose what businesses they want to support. The money we spend determines where the industry goes, and right now, the fashion industry isn\u0027t going anywhere but up.&nbsp;<|im_end|>

# Apple’s Clips App Is Snapchat For People Who Don’t Get Snapchat

Apple has announced a long-rumored video app called Clips, which allows you to shoot video and layer on graphics and filters–and even speak video subtitles–to then be shared on any social media platform you like. Essentially, it’s Apple’s answer to new media apps like Snapchat. Clips isn’t out yet–it’s “coming soon”–but you don’t need to investigate it very deeply to recognize the move from Apple’s playbook: It’s pure dadcore UX. It’s Apple translating a tweenspeak media interface into something that’s both obvious and nonthreatening for the olds. (And in the age of Snapchat, don’t we all feel just a little bit old?) Last year, Apple added a literal emoji dictionary to iMessages that automatically translates words into pictures for anyone unfamiliar with emoji. Much the same way, Clips introduces Snapchat’s “hold to record” function to the masses. But the difference between how Apple and Snap introduce the same feature with UI is telling. Snapchat first introduced “hold to record” with a tiny button and zero explanation. You had to decipher the app’s speakeasy-style interface to unlock its treasures. Evan Spiegel famously told the Daily Mail‘s Jon Steinberg, who was 38 at the time, that it didn’t matter if he didn’t get the UI. “You aren’t really the target,” Spiegel said. How did Apple introduce hold-to-record? By going full dadcore. It built a giant red button stretched across the screen like a piece of saltwater taffy that came free with a decoder ring. Emblazoned on the button are the words HOLD TO RECORD or HOLD TO ADD THIS PHOTO. Let’s hope that at least the instructions disappear over time–but then again, what else is Apple doing with this super wide button real estate but broadcast reaffirming messages? In fact, Apple might as well pile on more messaging: “hold button to record and stop holding to stop recording, and congrats on still being a 34 waist, you silver-dusted cowboy” would be welcome on my screen. It’s not beautiful UI. It’s by no means subtle. And frankly, there are so many buttons on the Clips screen–with upper and lower menu bars!–that it’s hard to imagine anyone not being a little bit overwhelmed compared to alternatives like Instagram, or even Snapchat. But it is designed with a very specific purpose that plays to Apple’s strengths–a massive user base that, with the right instruction, could learn to use the internet in new ways, too. (Today, as Snap has gone public and is facing Wall Street pressure to go truly mainstream, it too is loaded with UI assistants that pop up to explain how to do things until you’re proficient.) Plus, Clips can’t be any worse than Apple’s existing photo editor, right? And at least users will know: Make sure you HOLD TO RECORD.<|im_end|>

# Coast Guard halts search for missing cruise crewmember | WTOP

MIAMI (AP) — The Coast Guard has ended the search for a crewmember from a cruise ship in the Atlantic Ocean off Florida’s coast.  According to the Royal Caribbean cruise line, co-workers saw the 26-year-old crewmember go overboard from the Majesty of the Seas early Thursday. The ship was about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Florida’s Hillsboro Inlet and sailing to Port Everglades at the end of a six-day cruise to the Bahamas.  In a statement Friday, the Coast Guard said its search covered nearly 1,400 square miles (3,600 square kilometers) and lasted roughly 24 hours before it was suspended.

# How Alexander Girard’s Folk Art Obsession Changed The Course Of Modernism

An amateur collector might own a handful of pieces, a hobbyist a few dozen, and a serious collector a few hundred. But when you hit 100,000, it’s a downright obsession. One of the few to attain that level of collector mania? The midcentury architect and designer Alexander Girard. Girard’s folk art collection reached 106,000 pieces before he donated it to the Museum of International Folk Art, in Santa Fe, in 1978. Dozens of those items–which include figurines, toys, and spiritual objects–are on view this summer as part of Alexander Girard: A Designer’s Universe, an exhibition at the Cranbrook Museum of Art that also did a stint at the Vitra Design Museum. “You can’t look at Girard’s work without looking at his folk art; to me they’re inseparable,” Monica Obniski, a curator at the Milwaukee Museum of Art and expert on Girard’s work who spoke at a recent symposium on the designer, tells Co.Design. “He was collecting vernacular and designing modern.” Girard’s collection wasn’t just an eccentric hobby–it was part and parcel of his work as an architect and a designer and a reflection of his legacy. He broke the rules of modernism by embracing the past, and in doing so, tempered its austerity. The collection, and the work that sprang from it, shows how collecting can nurture creative work. Designers collect for myriad reasons: to surround themselves with beautiful things, to explore variations on a theme, to admire the ingenuity of an object. But Girard had a more intimate relationship with his enormous collection: It informed his work, with some of his textiles and graphics directly referencing objects in his collection, and he often used pieces as prominent–and anachronistic–elements in the interiors he designed. The scale of Girard’s collection and how much he worked with traditional objects in the context of modern design was, and still is, a rarity. Girard’s collection included objects from the American Southwest, Mexico, Central and South America, India, and Eastern Europe. Growing up in a family of antique dealers, an appreciation of objects was in his blood, but he didn’t gravitate toward old artifacts so much as knickknacks aimed at tourists. On his travels, he would purchase folk art in bulk, often buying multiples of the same objects since he was thinking about his current and future interior design, staging, and exhibition work. A frequent collaborator with Charles and Ray Eames (who also collected folk art), Girard also used his collections as elaborate dioramas and sets for the couples’ films, like one on the Day of the Dead. Girard established the textile division of Herman Miller and eventually became the furniture company’s director of design. To Obniski, his work in the realm of office and commercial design signaled a shift in how tradition was perceived in the context of modernism. After all, the modern movement that actively broke with the past and embraced the machine-made over handcraft, earning it a reputation as cold, sterile, and void of personality. But Girard’s version of modern design embraced warmth, color, and personality. His interiors were vibrant, exciting, welcoming, and livable. They adhered to the foundational principles of modernism, but enlivened it by synthesizing industrial production with the colors and motifs of folk art. “This is really important when a corporation takes folk art on as part of their brand identity,” Obniski says. “It’s okay to not be a dogmatic, cold version of modernism, but to soften around the edges. One way to do that is through folk art.” The environmental enrichment panels Girard designed for Herman Miller riff off of folk art motifs. He also made it easier for everyday shoppers to welcome folk art into their homes through the company’s Textiles & Objects Shop, which he opened and curated in the 1960s to sell toys and figurines from around the world. Girard’s focus on selling objects that exist to bring people joy plays into Herman Miller’s recent revival of retail, since its New York store sells curated objects, housewares, and decorative items–folk art included. In fact, the designer’s eclectic approach feels right at home in the context of maximalism, which is experiencing a resurgence today. Today, Girard’s obsession with folk art and traditional craft is proof that faithful observance of rigid rules doesn’t necessarily yield the most exciting design.<|im_end|>

# Evacuees narrate their ordeal

Alvin Mwangi and James Magayi @PeopleDailyKe  ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi’s son Mike was one of the scores of people rescued yesterday by police from the DusitD2 Hotel complex 14 Riverside Drive, Nairobi.  The younger Mudavadi, who has an office on the second floor of the building, was trapped inside for an hour following a suspected terrorist attack.  He thanked security agents for the swift response to the incident. The complex houses hotels, offices and banks.  Scores of other people who had been trapped were rescued by multi-agency officers, with some narrating their near-death experience after gunmen took control of the complex.  Some who came out were too shocked to speak to journalists, while some shared their hideout locations on social media seeking help.  A handicapped employee of LG Electronics narrated how she hid under her desk as one of the attackers shot randomly. Her colleagues took off when gunfire erupted, leaving her alone.  “I crawled under a desk and stayed calm even when the attackers shot at something in the office,” she said sobbing  Another evacuee, Thiong’o Wachira, said he and his colleagues hid in the ceiling until help arrived. “I could only think about my children while up there.”<|im_end|>

# NT department heads put on notice over budget blowouts

NT Chief Minister threatens disciplinary action against agency heads for budget blowouts  Posted  Reining in routine overspending across Northern Territory Government departments forms the centre point of a plan to curb the region's spiralling debt crisis. Key points: Treasurer says expenditure growth rate should be lowered from 6 per cent to 3 per cent Health, corrections and police departments have been singled out as serial offenders for overspending Chief Minister will head up a review of government department efficiencies  Chief Minister Michael Gunner has pledged to take disciplinary action against department heads who come in over budget, making special reference to the "serial offenders" in police, corrections and health. In the weeks before Christmas last year, an interim fiscal report revealed the Territory was on track to be $35.7 billion in debt by 2029-30. Although the final version of that report is still about six weeks away, Mr Gunner and report author John Langoulant have outlined part of the budget repair strategy. According to Mr Langoulant, a former under-treasurer for the Western Australian government, the Northern Territory's budget would be manageable if it lowered expenditure growth from 6 per cent to 3 per cent a year — the equivalent of about $200 million. Otherwise it was on track to end up with the worst debt-to-revenue ratio in the country. "A 6 per cent to a 3 per cent reduction doesn't necessarily sound a lot, but in a public sector environment where that has become the standard practise, it does require a significant change in the way all the public service goes about their task," Mr Langoulant said.  'A change in culture needs to occur'  Mr Langoulant said forcing departments to stick to their allocated budgets would go a long way towards constraining expenditure growth. But that will take significant cultural change, with the NT Health Department blowing its allocated budget seven times in the past eight years. It was among three departments, along with corrections and police, that Mr Gunner singled out as chronic over-spenders. "Government now is actually going to require agencies to manage to a set budget, as distinct to having a mindset that a budget is, if you like, nothing more than an estimate which can be broken," Mr Langoulant said. "And that's a change in the culture which needs to occur." Mr Langoulant, who said he had been a part of five similar fiscal reviews, said he would be talking with industry groups and community representatives early next week, before his panel delivered a final set of recommendations to the Government in late February or early March. "The importance of this report is the Government now recognises that measures must be taken to wind that rate of expenditure growth back," he said. "If we wind that rate of expenditure growth from 6.2 per cent to 3 per cent … then the management of the Territory's financial position, particularly the debt profile, becomes a far more manageable outcome." Measuring spending against outcomes Yet Mr Gunner conceded these problem departments bore the brunt of the Territory's significant social problems, from alcohol abuse to chronic illness. "We know that there are reasons why police are busy at night, why our hospitals are full, why our prisons are full," Mr Gunner said. "A lot of what we need to do in the structural budget-repair space is that social reform around generational change."  Partly for this reason, Mr Gunner said he would be heading up a "root and branch" review process, as part of a wider budget repair strategy. This will see the chief executive of every NT government department make a presentation on how they deliver services efficiently, effectively and find value for money. But they will also have to detail how their department aligns with four recently articulated "government priorities", which focus on job creation, generational change, community safety and integrity. "We will need to make tough but smart decisions to bring the budget back to operational balance in the medium term," Mr Gunner said. "I can guarantee Territorians we won't be putting the economy and jobs at risk by following the advice of those calling for savage cuts to the public service." Disciplinary action promised While Mr Gunner promised disciplinary action would be used if NT departments continued to blow their budgets, he was vague about what form that would take. "We are actively looking at how we hold CEOs and agencies to account around their budget allocations. That's the work we are doing as a cabinet going into this budget," he said. Mr Langoulant pointed to examples from Western Australia, where if a government department blew its budget, it would be subjected to an external review of all its expenditures, and recommendations would then be made, removing a great deal of budget flexibility from those in charge. He also said if a WA health board blew its budget, the chief executive and chairman would be removed. While you're here … are you feeling curious?   _<|im_end|>

# Brother-Sister Duo, In Their 70s, Found Dead Inside House In Nagpur

A septuagenarian brother-sister duo were found dead inside their house in Tatya Tope Nagar area in the city on Tuesday, police said. Police suspect that they might have died due to some disease or committed suicide. Their bodies were recovered after the police were alerted about foul smell from the house. The victims were identified as Mohan Otwani and his sister Shanta Otwani, both aged between 70 and 75 years, an official said. "We received a call around 3 pm about foul smell coming from the house. However, when a police team went to the place, they found that the house was locked from inside," police inspector D R Patil said. "Besides the elderly siblings, nobody else lived in the house. The door of the house was always shut. Both of them might have died three days back due to some disease or committed suicide. But it will be confirmed once we get their post-mortem report," he said. Further investigation is on.<|im_end|>

# Want Your Coworkers To Take You More Seriously? Stop Doing These 8 Things

Most professionals care what their colleagues and the higher-ups think of them. That’s because how people perceive you and your work is often the determining factor in whether or not you get a promotion, raise, or access to leadership opportunities. Unfortunately, there are a lot of elements that go into determining what your work reputation actually is, and they’re not always easy to keep tabs on. The quality of your work matters of course, but the small actions you take each day add up to create a bigger picture about who you are. Ahead, find the most common pitfalls that people don’t realize are hurting them. 1. Saying Yes To Everything It might seem like being game for anything and everything asked of you, despite being busy, is a surefire way to earn a stellar rep, but it can actually pigeonhole you into a specific job longer than you want to be there–and make you look a little too eager. “If you always take on tasks, there will come a point in time when you become irreplaceable–and not in a good way,” says Leonard Kim, managing partner of InfluenceTree, a personal branding accelerator that teaches you how to position your brand, get featured in publications, and grow your social media following. Oftentimes, when people say yes to every single task presented to them, they are seen as so “good” at their role that they become the only person who can do it. “They’re never promoted because they have become the best person in the world at filling that job role,” Kim explains. In a sense, they become so synonymous with the role, that they’re no longer considered for opportunities to move up. So instead of biting off more than you can chew, stick to projects that interest you and that you realistically have time to do. 2. Getting Too “In The Zone” At The Office There’s nothing wrong with being focused, but it’s important to take stock of how you act in your day-to-day. “If you’re passing someone by, are you smiling? Do you say hi? Excuse me? Or do you seem rushed?” Kim asks. Sometimes, keeping your head down and your eyes on the prize can be mistaken for a negative outlook or an unfriendly attitude. “People take notice of all the small actions you make, so make sure you’re aware of what you’re doing and how it reflects on you.” 3. Only Caring What Your Boss Thinks “Your boss isn’t the only person who matters at work,” Kim says. “Your coworkers matter, too, and the last thing that you want them to do is to turn against you.” So yes, it’s good to impress your boss, but don’t do it at the cost of alienating your colleagues. 4. Refusing To Adapt “The most common thing I see people do that ruins their reputation at work is when they take a job that doesn’t fit with their personality, but don’t try to adapt,” Kim explains. “Employers try their best to hire culture fits for their office, but sometimes it just doesn’t work out. That means it’s up to you to adapt and mold yourself into your company’s culture.” Sometimes this situation can be tough to spot, but Kim says behavior that goes against the grain is generally an easy tell that something’s not quite right. “Do you work in a fast-paced environment, but you’re someone who takes things slow? Are you a stiff personality who tries to keep things all business in an office environment where everyone treats each other like family? Do you like to share stories about your weekends when everyone tries to be a bit more professional in the office? Chances are, you’re destroying your reputation and you don’t even know it.” 5. Talking Too Much (Or Too Little) There’s a delicate balance between saying more than necessary and not saying enough, and it’s important to strike that balance. “Let’s say you hopped on a conference call and introduced yourself, but said nothing afterwards. Maybe you said one sentence. Or maybe you talked for the entire conversation. People will think you have nothing to contribute, your opinion doesn’t matter, or that you want to steal the show for yourself,” Kim says. The key here is to learn to contribute the right amount–adding value but still listening to others–and then stay consistent. 6. Relying On Your Superiors To Solve Minor Conflicts Don’t get us wrong–if you’re having a serious issue with a colleague that requires HR involvement, by all means, get your superior involved. But if it’s something small, like a team member not pulling their weight on a specific project or a one-off comment that didn’t sit right with you, don’t go straight to the top, Kim says. Being seen as someone who will run to their manager as soon as things get tough isn’t exactly desirable. “If you’re having a conflict with someone at the office, try your best to resolve it on your own. If you can’t, then just avoid the other person. And if it becomes too much for you to handle, it may be time for you to take a conflict management class.” 7. Not Kicking Annoying Habits If you’re sensing a theme here, it’s that little things matter when it comes to determining your reputation. “Whether it’s chewing gum, smoking, wearing headphones at your computer, hovering over another coworker’s desk, or constantly being away from your desk, people take notice. Most of the time, the most subtle things are the ones that are holding you back from ultimate success,” Kim says. It might seem difficult to figure out what your little habits are that could be damaging your rep, but Kim suggests you ask yourself how you want to be seen at work. “Then think about how a person with those qualities would act at their office and compare them to your quirks. If the person you’re imagining isn’t chewing gum or hanging up cat pictures, then that’s probably something you shouldn’t be doing, either.” 8. Over-Performing Many people believe that working as hard as they possibly can and outperforming everyone else will put them on the fast track to success. According to Kim, this isn’t always true. “Sometimes, working harder than everyone else will work against you. You may be thinking, what’s the worst thing that can happen if you perform at your absolute best?” Well, sucking up didn’t work in grade school, and it also doesn’t work in an office environment. Kim’s advice is simple: Do your best, but don’t go overboard. “Be humble. Tone it down. Let your work speak for itself. That way, you’ll avoid any office politics.”<|im_end|>

# UFC Fight Night Cejudo vs. Dillashaw Brooklyn Odds, Betting Trends

In what is likely one of the final flyweight fights in UFC history, bantamweight champion T.J. Dillashaw (16-3) is dropping down a division to challenge 125-pound champ Henry Cejudo (13-2) in the main event of UFC Fight Night 143 at Brooklyn's Barclays Center on Saturday. Dillashaw is listed as a -210 favorite (bet $210 to win $100) on the UFC odds at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark in an effort to become the promotion's fourth simultaneous two-division title holder before the flyweights will reportedly be dissolved later this year. Cejudo is a +170 underdog (bet $100 to win $170) at sports betting sites and won the belt from former champ Demetrious Johnson via split decision at UFC 227 last August 4 after his opponent had defended the title a record 11 times. With Johnson no longer with the organization after being dealt to ONE Championship for Ben Askren in a bizarre sequence of events following that last bout, Cejudo has little competition at 125 pounds. Enter Dillashaw, who was interested in facing Johnson as well when he was still the champion of the division, although that matchup never materialized. Dillashaw is riding a four-fight winning streak since suffering a loss to former champ Dominick Cruz by split decision two years ago. The biggest issue for Dillashaw here will be the weight cut from 135 pounds, where he has fought for his entire MMA career. The other three simultaneous two-division champs all moved up a division rather than down. In the co-main event, a pair of heavyweights will duke it out in hopes of moving one step closer to a title shot. Former pro football player Greg Hardy will make his UFC debut as a massive -550 favorite opposite Allen Crowder, who is a sizable +375 underdog. Hardy's six-year NFL career came to an end after the 2015 season when he was not re-signed by the Dallas Cowboys, who gave him a second chance despite domestic violence charges that led to a suspension. As a pro fighter, he is 3-0 with three knockouts, all of which have taken place within the first minute of the first round. Crowder has more pro experience overall with a 9-3 record but lost his promotional debut to Justin Willis via first-round KO at UFC 218. Both he and Hardy made their way to the UFC by way of Dana White's Tuesday Night Contender Series.<|im_end|>

# Raf Simons Has a Peculiar Runway Show Habit—Have You Noticed It?

It is extremely rare for a designer’s bow to be the most riveting part of a fashion show. Those who have historically pulled it off possessed the showmanship gene: Lee McQueen in his infamous bunny suit, John Galliano in his seasonal getups at Dior, Alexander Wang and his mile-long sprints. Raf Simons is far from flashy, and yet, I’ve been watching him appear for his finale walks with eagle eyes since 2012. The reason is a simple hand gesture Simons has made, without fail, at his final fashion shows for Jil Sander, Christian Dior, and Calvin Klein. At Simons’s emotional final show for Jil Sander during the Fall 2012 season, the designer emerged from backstage for a tearful bow as the audience rose for a standing ovation. After waving, Simons then raised his hands, mouthed “I love you all,” and made a heart with his hands. The image of his tearful heart symbol circulated on Twitter and Instagram like wildfire—a beloved designer stepping away from a house he revitalized and then expressing his sorrow and love was exactly the thing to tug at the fashion world’s heartstrings. Less than one year later, Simons started at Christian Dior. For 16 runway shows at the esteemed French house, Simons stepped out for his bow with a simple wave. Then came the 17th, a Picnic at Hanging Rock–inspired display of sweetness and sexiness, set against a landscape of delphiniums. When Simons ran across the runway, he again made the heart shape with his hands. Just weeks after the show, news broke that Simons’s contract was not renewed, and he would be leaving Dior. So for the second time, Simons had made the heart gesture during a final collection’s show. Here’s where it gets interesting. At Calvin Klein’s Spring 2019 show in New York, Simons appeared for a brief bow and made a heart shape with his hands before returning backstage. Three months after the show, Simons parted ways with CK in the middle of a three-year contract. So here’s where we are: three final shows, three heart hand gestures. Related? Maybe, maybe not. But if you happen to see Simons in Paris doing this, please, let me know.<|im_end|>

# UAPD Announces Passing Of Retired K9 Officer, One Of The First To Serve There

FAYETTEVILLE (KFSM) — A retired K9 officer that was one of the first hired by the University of Arkansas Police Department has died, UAPD announced Wednesday night.  K9 Officer Orno died on Jan. 15 at 13 years of age, according to post from the UAPD.  Orno served on the UAPD with his handler and partner Cpl. Chris Krodell for six years and was one of the first two K9s to be employed by the department when the K9 division was created in 2010. Both original K9s retired, but the program continued, and the UAPD currently has four K9 units.  Orno was purchased by the Athletics Department at the UA for the purpose of providing security during game days. Orno was trained both in handler protection and in explosives detection.  Orno retired in 2014 and spent his retirement at home with Krodell, who went from handler to owner.  “K9 Orno will be greatly missed by all of us at the department and especially by Cpl. Krodell and his family,” the UAPD said in the post. “Please keep him and his family in your thoughts and prayers during this time.  “Rest easy, Orno man, we’ve got it from here.”<|im_end|>

# Barcelona Is Really Serious About Its War On Tourism

Barely two days after banning all new hotels from its city center, Barcelona is escalating its war on tourism. Mayor Ada Colau presented her Strategic Plan For Tourism 2020, which includes measures that she says will further curb tourism and reclaim the city for its inhabitants. Barcelona has a population of 1.6 million, and received 32 million visitors last year. Tourism accounts for a significant chunk of the city’s economy–14%–but the ill effects on permanent residents from being such a tourist destination are starting to pile up. The tourism industry pushes out local stores in the city center to make room for bland bars and tourist-trap shopping. Employment is seasonal and casual–a serious problem in a country with an unemployment rate at around 43% for young people–and property prices keep rising, along with rental costs, making it nearly impossible for residents to find affordable housing. The new plan’s goal is to “govern tourism,” according to El País. Colau seeks to curb the worst excesses of the industry, and tightly control those it allows to remain in place. In an effort to dampen the short-term rental market, Barcelona will now apply the highest property tax rate to vacation apartments, and the city will not provide licenses for new tourist apartments. The city council is also seeking permission from the Catalan government to regulate room rentals in non-hotel accommodations, like bed and breakfasts, which would allow the city to dictate how many rooms are available per floor, or for how much of the year those rooms could be rented out. Sleepover tourism, however, is not the only target of the Strategic Plan: New measures will also ramp up charges for day trippers, making Barcelona less attractive as a cheap tourist destination. This will mostly be accomplished through indirect means: A test scheme, for instance, will raise the parking rates for tourist buses stopping at the Montjuïc fountains–a major traffic hotspot as well as tourist hellhole–from €4.50 to €34 ($4.80 to $36). That, in turn, will likely hike the cost for people on the buses. Other measures will affect residents more directly: There are plans to limit the use of Segways and electric scooters in the more touristic parts of the city (they are on the seafront), to pedestrianize certain hotspots on the busiest days, and to relocate the terraces of bars and restaurants, which often take over public spaces. Taken together, it’s obvious that Barcelona is serious about curbing tourism, and instead focusing on an economy that can create greater benefit for its local residents. The tourism sector isn’t happy, of course, but the industry relies on growth and invasion at the expense of local culture. Tourism may be a big money maker, but it has minimal benefits for the majority of citizens.<|im_end|>

# House Committee Plans Hearing About Trump’s Deployment of Military to the Border

The House Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing about the Trump administration’s deployment of the military to the U.S.-Mexico border on Tuesday, NPR reports.  In the run up to the 2018 midterm elections, President Donald Trump frequently claimed that a dangerous migrant caravan was approaching the southern border. He sent thousands of active duty military troops there to help block the migrants—a move some say was a political stunt to drum up support for Trump’s border security plan.  Many of those troops remain at the border today.  The new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, aims to look into the matter.  “We want an explanation of the policy. We want to shine a light on it and make it clear—in my view—that there is no legitimate purpose here,” Smith said on NPR Monday morning.  While he said he broadly agrees with some of the president’s goals, such as pulling troops out of Syria and Afghanistan, Smith told NPR that Trump sending troops to the border was “absolutely not” a legitimate use of the military and that the idea of an immigrant invasion is “utter and complete nonsense.”  “The president is manufacturing a crisis to pander to his base,” said Smith. “He made [the promise to build a wall] because it played well to the crowd. Something that plays well to the crowd doesn’t translate into policy.”  To Smith, sending troops to the border was a waste of resources. He said they may have put up barbed wire and built a temporary structure or two, but “you can’t tell me that was a good use of their time.”  “Most of those people who went down to the border were sitting around playing cards because they didn’t have anything to do because there was no invasion,” he said.  The real crisis, said Smith, is processing asylum seekers.  “These caravans that are coming? They’re turning themselves in,” said Smith. “You don’t need a wall. You don’t need to stop them. We need stuff to process them.”  Trump has long targeted the U.S. asylum program, which allows immigrants to apply for protection regardless of how they arrived in the country. After failing to restrict asylum seekers to official ports of entry, the Trump administration is now returning some asylum seekers to Mexico to await their court date.  Smith said the country could use more money for judges to process asylum seekers.  “Processing asylum seekers is the crisis,” said Smith, “and the president is demagoguing this issue instead of addressing the problems that he raises.”<|im_end|>

# “Big Bet” Philanthropy Can Pay Off Remarkably, But Remember It’s A Bet

The world’s wealthiest philanthropic donors are suffering their own so-far incurable problem: They’re allergic to making big bets, gifts of over $10 million to social change issues. The technical term for this is called the “aspiration gap.” It was coined by Bridgespan, a consulting firm for nonprofits and philanthropists, which has found that while roughly 80% of the world’s most wealthy and seemingly nimble donors–those who’ve committed to the Giving Pledge or are regularly listed among Forbes Top 50 donors–say they’re interested in tackling social change issues, only 20% follow through. That might change now that there’s a big-bet primer: Bridgespan has released a new report auditing the decades long big bets of Atlantic Philanthropies, whose founder, the duty-free shop billionaire Chuck Feeney, inspired the “giving while living” movement. The limited life foundation, which initially started in 1982, plans to give away a total of $8 billion by the time it dissolves in 2020. (Full disclosure: Atlantic is also funding Fast Company’s philanthropy coverage). According to Bridgespan, 60% of Atlantic’s grants could be big bets, and 30% went to social change. No one’s running the table, but it’s a start. According to Bridgespan’s report, the real problem is that social change is messy. There generally aren’t ready-baked processes to improve things like basic human services, the environment, and international development, or make educational and institutional gifts geared directly toward anti-poverty or disease eradication solutions for low-income people. For those with the deepest pockets, finding the right partners or programs can be hard, as is tracking progress. Long term change also requires long term investments, which means placing trust in a group that may not have a totally proven track record–or funding your own, which becomes equally complicated. That doesn’t mean people aren’t trying: Billionaire J.B Pritzker is making great strides in early childhood development. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, whose work was excluded from Bridgespan’s findings because it is such an outlier, has practically outspent all of major social change donors combined. For those willing to go all-in to help others, it provides a rulebook for what’s working (and what doesn’t). 1. Look for funding gaps and leverage them. Several decades ago, Ireland was suffering from a sub-par university system that caused many researchers and students leave the country. While Feeney, an Irish-American, had already invested heavily in improving education, he was seeing a glacial change. He met with the government and offered $125 million, if they would match it. They ended up putting in a total of $176 million to create six times that in government funding. That led to 46 research institutes or programs, 1,000 research positions, and 1,600 new postgraduate positions. Innovations coming out of the space now contribute far more to the economy than the initial investment. Study co-author William Foster, a Bridgespan partner, calls this the “but for” approach: “But for Atlantic this other stuff wouldn’t have happened,” he says. In this case, that meant being able to push for matching funds. Atlantic has used a similar strategy to improve community health clinics in Vietnam, after proving success in two provinces, and then asking other provincial governments, and at times the national government, to buy-in. 2. Offer unrestricted support. To encourage other donors and groups to become more ambitious, Atlantic spent $54 million on professionalizing the nonprofit sector. Their work started in the early ’90s, but that figure jumped to $200 million over time. That included grants to groups like Urban Institute and GuideStar, who pioneered collecting and making publically available the sort of tax and performance data that allows donors, grantees and watchdogs check and measure success. Because the funding was unrestricted, GuideStar was able to grow steadily while figuring out its own funding model. Atlantic also supported Bridgespan with early funding. The limited life foundation helped start or supported emerging nonprofit programs and research centers and major universities including NYU, Indiana University, and Harvard. Within 10 years, the total number of graduate programs quintupled. (They’ve also pioneered a similar “infrastructure-first” to help LGBT rights groups in Ireland.) “For most of their history… when they backed you, they backed you,” Foster says. “They picked a leader and a cause and have unrestricted money because they trusted you. It’s what people in this sector will often say is the right way to do things, but it’s very unusual behavior.” 3. Seek Help: Staying flexible aids success. In 2005, the juvenile death penalty was overturned. Atlantic had backed a part of that effort but wanted to invest more heavily in a push to overturn capital punishment completely. Except the battle plan to do so was extremely complicated. Battles have to be won on a state-by-state basis, with hopes of pushing a Supreme Court resolution. Rather than fund groups directly, Atlantic gave $59 million to Proteus Fund, which had been engaged on the topic for years and better understood the landscape. Eventually, they created the Atlantic Advocacy Fund, a 501c4 that supports more politicized voter lobbying efforts, as opposed to research or litigation. There’s far more work to be done, but since 2007 that big bet has played a role in seven states abolishing the death penalty, and four enacting a general stay-of execution. In 2015, total number of executions and death penalty sentences reached an all time low. “Such collaboration may be more complicated than going it alone,” the report notes, but ultimately worth it. One of Bridgespan’s main reflections is that Atlantic may not have remained engaged long enough in some cases to make the impact it initially intended. Why? In general, researchers agree that it takes about a decade for societal changing projects to make a lasting impact. But in Atlantic’s case, some programs seem to have shifted as their leadership changed. “The most really ambitious social change takes longer to play out than the average tenure of a CEO, “ Foster says. Atlantic’s president and CEO Chris Oechsli agrees with that. Since taking over the group in 2011, he’s tried to abide by two rules. “One, see it through,” he says. “Two, be careful in your transitions as you adjust your grant making strategy to not leave untapped potential on the table.” But Oechsli cautions agencies to be careful about grading themselves against equally ready-made metrics for success. Technically, Feeney’s university building efforts in Ireland, among many other progressive investments, don’t qualify under Bridgespan’s definition of a social change project. They were reviewed because they represent a hugely successful big bet, but not one that created direct social change. Oechsli prefers to think of such programs as “indirect investment.” In this case, Ireland probably groomed a fair amount of academics and entrepreneurs, who will go on to work in the field. (Either way, the experience affected Atlantic’s institutional learning curve for such ventures.) Groups should be cautious about defining themselves too much by “bright line” metrics, he says–those that unnecessarily segregate what works and what doesn’t perhaps a little too neatly. “Does an investment in those types of experiences not count? I don’t know, that’s a question,” he says. “You never stop learning and implicit in that is [the idea] that to be effective and make big bets requires being comfortable with risk.”<|im_end|>

# Are You Suffering From Toxic Masculinity? Know The Warning Signs

More than 40% of men today suffer from it---and their loved ones pay the price.  It's called "toxic masculinity," and it's the latest disease to plague the nation. It can affect every aspect of a toxic man's life. Worst of all, toxic masculinity is contagious, so if you're infected, you need to know right away so you can avoid spreading it to your friends and family.  Are you or a loved one suffering from toxic masculinity? Know the warning signs so you can seek help:  
	 Even the faintest whisper of facial hair - If you have a mustache, schedule a check-up. If you find a goatee on your face, consider going into the emergency room. If you have a full-grown beard, well, it's probably too late for you.  
	 A belief that men and women are at least a little bit different - Should you be infected with the cancerous idea that men and women are even the slightest bit different from one another, you could have toxic masculinity. If you're a woman who believes this, then you suffer from an even worse disease called internalized misogyny.  
	 Throwing a professional wrestler off a steel cage right through the announcer's table - Men who suddenly look around and find that they're tossing a professional wrestler off a steel cage to plummet right through the announcer's table are at high risk of developing toxic masculinity. If a man in your life is suffering from this symptom, encourage him to stop wrestling in the WWE immediately.  
	 Eating meat on occasion - A disease like toxic masculinity can quickly change your diet. If you find yourself leaving your vegan avocado quinoa toast smoothies untouched in favor of wolfing down some bacon-wrapped bacon, you might have toxic masculinity.  
	 Holding the door open for a woman once in a while - It looks innocent enough: a woman approaches, and you hold the door so she doesn't have to open it again. Seems like common courtesy, right? WRONG. It's one of the first warning signs of toxic masculinity, and you need to do better if you're going to beat this thing. One way to reduce your toxic masculinity is to slam the door right in a woman's face and scream, "EQUALITY!!!" through the glass when she glares at you.  
	 Yelling stuff about freedom and charging into battle wearing blue face paint - If you find yourself charging into battle against the English wearing blue face paint in the 14th century, you might be beyond medical help. Do all of society a favor and get yourself drawn and quartered so no one else catches this contagious illness.  
	 Being a man who doesn't hate himself - This is the most telling sign. If you're a biological male and you don't hate yourself, toxic masculinity is already coursing through your veins. If there's going to be any hope of recovery, you need to begin hating yourself today.  If you or your man are showing one or more of these symptoms, contact your medical professional today. Get help, before it's too late.<|im_end|>

# Theresa May no confidence vote: How many MPs will vote AGAINST Theresa May TONIGHT?

How many MPs will vote AGAINST Theresa May TONIGHT? According to bookmakers Betway, more than 300 MPs are expected to support today’s motion of no confidence in Theresa May. Betway has made the number of anti-May MPs at 310 to 319 being the most likely bracket of votes against the leader at 4/9. This would not be enough to force May’s resignation, however, and the firm makes her heavily odds-on at 1/33 to survive today’s vote and 10/1 for a surprise defeat. The online bookmaker expects the PM’s next move will be to seek an extension of Article 50 at just 1/5. For Jeremy Corbyn to endorse a second referendum first is 8/11. Another potential is for May to step down by the end of the week at 7/2 and 8/1 for no significant developments before 29th March, resulting in the UK leaving the EU with no deal. Betway spokesman Alan Alger said: “Theresa May doesn’t have much room for maneuverer ahead of today’s vote of no confidence, with it just 4/9 for her to receive 310-319 no confidence votes. However, there’s little sign of her own party rebelling and we expect May to get through the vote at just 1/33. “The big question is what her next move will be, with an extension of Article 50 the most obvious play at 1/5, though Jeremy Corbyn could put a spanner in the works and endorse a second referendum first at 8/11.” Following Mrs May’s defeat on Tuesday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he "profoundly" regretted the Commons vote and that it was now up to the British Government to say how it intended to proceed. "An orderly withdrawal will remain our absolute priority in the coming weeks," he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg. He said there would be a "favourable response" from the EU side if Mrs May was prepared to re-think her red lines and seek a more "ambitious" deal with Brussels. However, he was adamant the backstop had to remain part of any agreement. "The backstop which we agreed to with the UK must remain a backstop. It must remain a credible backstop," he said. Mrs May has today reiterated the Government wants the UK to leave the EU on March 29, telling MPs in the House of Commons: "The EU would only extend Article 50 if actually, it was clear there was a plan that was moving towards an agreed deal." Votes supporting a motion of no confidence according to Betway 249 or less - 100/1 250-259 - 40/1 260-269 - 33/1 270-279 - 25/1 280-289 - 20/1 290-299 - 12/1 300-309 - 11/4 310-319 - 4/9 320-329 - 10/1 330-339 - 33/1 340-349 - 66/1 250 or more - 100/1<|im_end|>

# Wife of jailed Taiwanese activist condemns Beijing over visit ban

Wife of jailed Taiwanese activist condemns Beijing after she is barred from visits  NGO worker Lee Ming-che is serving a five-year jail term on the mainland on charges of subverting state power His wife, Lee Ching-yu, says she has been temporarily banned from seeing him because she criticised prison conditions last month The wife of a Taiwanese activist jailed in mainland China condemned Beijing on Tuesday after she was banned from visiting him in prison for three months in a case that has strained cross-strait ties.  NGO worker Lee Ming-che was sentenced to five years in prison in November 2017 on charges of subverting state power by a court in central Hunan province.  Lee was arrested in March that year during a trip to the mainland and held incommunicado for months.  Taipei has called his jailing “unacceptable” and a serious blow to relations with Beijing, while his wife Lee Ching-yu described his trial as a “political show”.  Wife of jailed Taiwanese activist Lee Ming-che again barred from boarding flight to see husband on mainland  After visiting him in jail, Lee Ching-yu publicly criticised prison conditions last month saying her husband had lost weight because food was often rotten, that he was denied warm clothing and had to work over 10 hours daily.  On Tuesday she said she had since been temporarily banned from seeing her husband because of the criticism, citing a notice from prison authorities who accused her of a “serious distortion of the facts”.  “Lee Ming-che is a prisoner of conscience,” she told reporters.  “I only truthfully recounted what I saw and heard about his situation,” she said.  “I remember he asked me urgently … to ‘go everywhere and tell everybody’ of his treatment in prison,” she added.  How China’s trial of Lee Ming-che is a warning to Taiwanese activists inspired by freedoms and democracy  During his trial, Lee admitted the charges, stating that he had written and distributed online articles that criticised the mainland’s ruling Communist Party and promoted democracy.  He had shared “Taiwan’s democratic experiences” with his mainland friends online for many years and often mailed books to them, according to the Taiwan Association for Human Rights.  Lee Ching-yu urged the mainland government to allow international rights groups and the Mainland Affairs Council, Taiwan’s top cross-strait policymaking body, to visit her husband if she was now banned.  Amnesty International and Taiwanese rights groups have maintained that Lee is innocent and called for his immediate release.  “When families can’t visit [Lee] in prison, we are most worried that he could be subject to torture or other inhumane treatment,” said Annie Huang, Amnesty International Taiwan’s acting section director.<|im_end|>

# Here’s the latest on the ongoing WannaCrypt global cyber attack

After crippling computers across the world—including some of those used by Britain’s NHS—on Friday, the WannaCrypt ransomware has continued to spread as workers returned to work in Asia this morning. Here’s the latest: • Europol said that as of Sunday the ransomware attack affected 200,000 victims in over 150 countries, reports the Japan Times. • “Hundreds of thousands” of computers at nearly 30,000 Chinese institutions and government agencies have been affected, reports the Guardian. • In Japan, 2,000 computers at 600 locations, including those at Nissan and Hitachi, had been hit. • Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer has written a scathing blog post condemning America’s intelligence agencies for their roles in the attack: This attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem. This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world. Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen. And this most recent attack represents a completely unintended but disconcerting link between the two most serious forms of cybersecurity threats in the world today–nation-state action and organized criminal action.<|im_end|>

# Gemma Collins and Philip Schofield caught in Dancing on Ice 'fix' row

Gemma Collins at centre of Dancing on Ice 'fix' row after THIS comment from Philip Schofield  4 February 2019, 07:19 | Updated: 4 February 2019, 07:50  Viewers' ears pricked up when they heard the silver-haired presenter say THIS to Gemma after her performance.  Dancing On Ice fans think the competition is 'FIXED' after Philip Schofield appeared to tell Gemma Collins she would be in next week's show... despite a terrible performance. As part of 'fairytales' week, the 38-year-old unleashed her inner evil queen to skate with partner Matt Evers to Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do. But as she faced the judges moments after leaving the ice, she burst in to tears, telling them that a terrifying fall last week had knocked her confidence. Appearing to try and soothe her, the silver-haired presenter told her that she still had time to get her confidence back. He said: "Well, we've got next week as well. "So you've got the whole week to build back up again." People at home immediately leapt on the comment, claiming it's evidence that the show is RIGGED. One tweeted: "A blunder? Is the show a fix? She gets consistent bad scores, can’t dance nor skate and yet gets through week after week. Must be a fix?" Another wrote: "Pressure is on @ITV phillip Schofield says about Gemma skating next week and has a week to build, up before any vote has taken place #fix". Another branded the show 'dodgy', tweeting: "Is it worth voting if @Schofe said Gemma will have next week? Was it a slip up? Hmmmm sounds a bit dodgy."   Not amusing.. hilarious. I said it to Gemma cos she was crying. Oh btw .. it’s illegal to fix tv shows and I wouldn’t work on one that was — Phillip Schofield (@Schofe) February 3, 2019  Sorry for consoling a crying contestant. NOT — Phillip Schofield (@Schofe) February 3, 2019 However, Philip was fuming about the accusations and later went on Twitter himself to defend himself - and the integrity of the long-running show. He hit back at one fan - who had tweeted him and OFCOM: "We say that to everyone! You are hilarious with your conspiracy theory. Voting is independently adjudicated. I only know the result as I say it. "Not amusing.. hilarious. I said it to Gemma cos she was crying. Oh btw .. it’s illegal to fix tv shows and I wouldn’t work on one that was."<|im_end|>

# VIDEO: District investigates brawl after high school wrestler appears to attack coach

SAFFORD, AZ (KOLD News 13) - Just seconds after a high school wrestling match ended, an apparent assault happened at a sectional meet on Saturday, Feb. 2.  Multiple videos were sent to KOLD News 13 following the tense situation involving southern Arizona athletes and coaches.  The incident started during a match between wrestlers from Canyon del Oro High School and Salpointe Catholic High School during the sectional meet at Safford High School.  In a video, it appears the CDO wrestler elbowed a Salpointe wrestler in the neck.  The referee blew the whistle and after a little pushing, coaches ran onto the mat, with a CDO coach pulling his wrestler from the center of the mat.  KOLD News 13 has blurred the face of the CDO wrestler involved.  With a disqualification, the referee declared the match for Salpointe. The two wrestlers met in the middle of the mat, shook hands and made their way back to their teams. But the wrestling didn’t end there.  After a few seconds, a Salpointe coach, wearing a white shirt, walked onto the mat and out of the view of the camera. That is when the CDO wrestler appeared to charge at the coach and tackled him to the ground.  The two wrestle for a second and the first video ends.  A second video, shot from a different angle, appears to show the ensuing fight.  The video shows about eight to 10 men, in both CDO and Salpointe clothing, pushing and pulling others away from the mat. Several people joined in from the stands and surrounding area.  About 40 seconds into the second video, the group began to separate and the situation appeared to end.  A Salpointe spokesman told KOLD News 13 the assistant coach is OK.  The Safford Police Department has not yet confirmed released any information about possible citations or charges.  Amphitheater Public Schools provided this statement on Sunday night, Feb. 3:  “Amphitheater Public Schools is aware of the incident that occurred at a wrestling match on Saturday. The District is investigating and will follow its Code of Conduct in determining any disciplinary action.”<|im_end|>

# The Crisis in the Justice System

The State of Grenada comprises three independent but co-equal arms of Government: the Executive (Cabinet), the Legislature (Parliament) and the Judiciary (the Courts). In order for Government to function efficiently, all three arms must be fully operational, none compromised. If one arm ceases to function, there is national chaos. The chaos may not be readily noticeable, but its disastrous effects are sure to be eventually felt by all.  Last Monday, lawyers held a public protest to bring focus on the dire state of the Judiciary in this country. In any country, when lawyers resort to protest action, we know there is a serious crisis at hand.  Since the mid-1990s, the Judiciary has been neglected. The NNP administration for years has been shirking its responsibility to fund and upgrade the courts, the Supreme Court Registry and the Deeds and Land Registry. When the NDC assumed office in 2008, the system was on the verge of collapse. The NDC Government undertook certain remedial measures, including:  (1). With World Bank, desperately needed digitisation of the records at the Deeds & Land Registry. This was to save the records, some of which were already partially lost, and to eliminate the actual handling of the fragile ledgers. The Deeds & Land Registry is the official archive for all land transactions in Grenada. Incomplete records therefore mean unreliable title searches. Unreliable searches put the people and the financial institutions doing land transactions at risk. The project was well advanced by the 2013 elections. There was absolutely no reason why it should not have continued, but it was stopped by this uncaring, reckless NNP administration.  (2). As part of the digitisation project, we introduced online title searches. The need to physically go to the Registry to do title searches (handling the fragile records) was being phased out. Lawyers were already utilising the system. By 2014, the online service was stopped because the Government stopped paying the necessary subscription which was a manageable sum.  (3). By 2013, the NDC Government was in the advanced stages of establishing a land agency. Draft legislation was already done and some staff was identified. That agency would have separated the Deeds & Land Registry from the Supreme Court Registry making for greater efficiency in the system all around. Again there is no good reason why this was not pursued.  (4). In 2011, the NDC set up the Commercial & Intellectual Property Office and passed new Intellectual Property laws. This development removed the registration of Companies, Businesses, Trade Marks & Patents from the Supreme Court Registry. The improved efficiency that resulted was one factor in our improved ranking on the ease of doing business index. That office had to be closed for over a month last year due to neglect by the Government.  (5). For the first time ever, in 2012, the NDC Cabinet approved the appointment of 2 Judicial Assistants to help judges with research and preparation of judgments. These positions were to be filled for the 2013 fiscal year. Up to this day that has not been done. This is how a Government that says it cares for the people, especially the poor, behaves.  (6). The NDC Government negotiated the acquisition of the LIME Building to serve as a temporary Hall of Justice until a permanent home could be constructed. The work was very advanced by February 2013. That’s why the courts were able to move into that facility during 2014.  (7). Work was very advanced for the construction of the Hall of Justice at Mt. Wheldale. There is no conceivable reason why, in the last 6 years, this project was not completed. The architectural drawings, the site and some other resources were already done and identified when the NNP assumed office. This failure only points to pure incompetence and an uncaring Government.  (8). Two additional judges were appointed to cater for the backlog and the increased case load.  (9). The NDC was in the process of sourcing new court reporting equipment to introduce real time preparation of trial transcripts. We were aware of the hardship people endured in having to wait years for judgments and trial transcripts to have their appeals to be heard. Now, some people have been waiting up to six years for their transcripts and the court reporting unit remains under equipped and under staffed.  All of the above initiatives of the NDC were abandoned by the NNP because they have decided that these issues do not win them votes. They are demonstrating their total lack of care for the ordinary man and their obsession with power.  It is unconscionable for Mitchell to appear on national TV and tell the nation that things are not as bad and that the lawyers are not accurately representing the facts. No one but Mitchell must take responsibility for the dire state of the judiciary. Under our laws, the only entity responsible for the Courts is the Executive. Imagine he is even blaming the Privy Council, stating that they never helped. Since when is a Court a funding agency? Shame on you Mitchell!  The NNP has shown time and again that they are a wholly incompetent bunch. They did nothing for the judiciary for 13 years between 1995 and 2008 and even after getting a jump start from the NDC, they have proved incapable of building on that start or of starting any new initiatives to enhance the judiciary.  In life, anyone who is given a start and does not build on it is deemed an abject failure. So is the NNP with the judiciary of Grenada.  (The above reflects the views of the main opposition National Democratic Congress)<|im_end|>

# Youtube suspends adverts on Tommy Robinson’s account

YouTube has demonetised the account of controversial activist Tommy Robinson for breaching the site’s advertising guidelines.  The Google-owned video platform said it had placed the restrictions on Robinson’s YouTube channel - which has 270,000 subscribers - for content around controversial issues and sensitive events. The ban comes a day after YouTube removed adverts for far-right group Britain First from the platform for breaching rules which prohibit content which promotes “hatred, intolerance or discrimination”. Video creators on YouTube are able to collect money from advertising by allowing adverts to be shown on their videos. “We have suspended ads on Tommy Robinson’s YouTube channel as it breaches our advertising policies,” a YouTube spokesperson said. In response Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, told the Press Association the incident was “continued censorship”. Last year, the former English Defence League leader was banned from Twitter and online payment platform PayPal, both of which pointed to their rules on hate speech as reasons for imposing a ban. Referencing his most recent video on the site, which recaps 2018 and is one of those now subject to the restrictions, Robinson said “there’s nothing hateful in it”. The video includes footage which Robinson claims shows him punching a migrant on a street in Italy. YouTube said it believed strongly in the freedom of expression but it had a responsibility to protect its entire community of creators, viewers and advertisers from what it called derogatory and disparaging content.<|im_end|>

# Musician Books of Poetry / Lyrics

Florence Welch is in New Zealand this week with Florence and the Machine, playing at Laneway Festival as well as doing a standalone concert.

# Police: Finding Savannah Spurlock 'continues to be a top priority'

RICHMOND, Ky. (WKYT) - Richmond police are continuing the search for a mother of four who was last seen leaving a downtown Lexington bar January 4.  Photos: Richmond Police Department  Detectives released new frames of surveillance from when Savannah Spurlock, 22, left The Other Bar early that morning in a new Facebook post.  Police identified and questioned the men last seen with Spurlock, and detectives have yet to file criminal charges. Police did serve a search warrant in Garrard County in connection to the case. This included a car being towed at a home where the search was conducted.  Search teams continue to volunteer time in hopes of finding Spurlock. This includes a Louisiana crew which is coming to Kentucky after helping in the search for Cynthiana native Emily Wade in Texas. The police department is thanking for the outreach and the continued publication of Spurlock's disappearance in news media and social media.  Anyone with information should call the Richmond Police Department at 859-624-4776 or email information to detective@richmond.ky.us.<|im_end|>

# School of social work lends perspective on off-campus learning

By Adrienne Redman | Reporter  Walking into the Baylor School of Social Work often leaves people wondering if they have walked into the wrong building. Located at 811 Washington Ave. in downtown Waco, the Diana R. Garland School of Social Work campus thrives in a repurposed Wells Fargo bank.  The social work department at Baylor University outgrew its on-campus Speight Plaza offices in 2010 and moved downtown, where students say they are given a glimpse into how the real world of social work operates.  Rosemary Watson, a masters of social work student from Baton Rouge, La., decided to pursue a career in the field during her freshman year at Baylor.  “My family is deaf, so I’ve seen a lot of injustice and have really sought to help them find their voices and advocate for them,” Watson said. “That’s what got me in the direction of social justice.”  Watson changed her major from business within the first week of the semester, and fell in love with social work during the introductory class. The building has served as a safe-space for her, where she can experience and process the tough issues social work students face daily.  “You talk about a lot of really hard things. And so the spaces that you have where you need to process those things need to be safe,” Watson said. “When you’re on main campus, sometimes it may feel like those areas are not as safe because so many other things, other classes, other experiences, all happen there.”  Students like Watson have also felt comfort in the lobby of the social work building that sits at the top of the escalators, lovingly referred to as the “Living Room.” Complete with tables, couches and blankets, this gathering area serves as a place where students can interact with one another and find support.  “I know that if I was to be sitting in the lobby and start crying someone would check on me,” Watson said.  Sarah Pitman, another masters of social work student from Waco, loves the downtown campus for the bridge it creates between Baylor and the community that surrounds it. As an undergraduate, Pitman was a university scholars major and says she rarely left campus aside from the internship that eventually drew her to pursue a Masters in Social Work.  “It gives us a push to leave the Baylor bubble and to expose ourselves to things,” Pitman said. “In my mind it gives the Waco community more access to Baylor. It kind of bridges the gap between what they perceive Baylor as being and what we perceive the Waco community as being.”  The downtown building poses some logistical issues, however, as students may find it difficult traveling back and forth for on-campus classes. Students without vehicles often find rides from friends, as Watson did after breaking her shoulder last year.  “I put it in our class GroupMe that I needed rides and six people immediately were like, ‘I’ll come pick you up!” she said.  There is also a bus route to and from the building but it is not always reliable, according to Pitman.  “[The bus is] not the best and I’d say that’s a downside. It can be kind of inaccessible,” she said.  Despite the distance, the positives of having a Social Work Building downtown far outweigh the negatives for many students. For Pitman, it is the real-world experience her Social Work professors can impart, many of whom are currently practicing in Waco in addition to teaching classes. And for Watson, it is the safety and comfort she feels within the community of the building.  “At the School of Social Work it’s almost a sacred space,” Pitman said. “This space is one where you know you’re going to learn and be challenged, but also be supported.”<|im_end|>

# PRECIOUS-Gold prices near 1-wk lows as investors turn to riskier assets

* SPDR Gold holdings fall for second straight session * Liquidity light due to Lunar New Year holiday (Adds comment, updates prices) By Sethuraman N R Feb 5 (Reuters) - Gold prices on Tuesday held near one-week lows touched in the previous session, pressured by a firmer dollar and as investor appetite for riskier assets improved in the wake of strong U.S. economic data. Spot gold was steady at $1,313.95 per ounce at 0349 GMT. Prices in the last session fell to their lowest since Jan. 29 at $1,308.20. U.S. gold futures dipped 0.1 percent to $1,318.40 an ounce. Trading was muted in Asia with many markets closed for much of the week for Lunar New Year holidays. “Gold fell overnight as bond yields ticked up and the dollar was also strong due to a risk-on environment,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, OANDA. “There is strong technical support and the Fed is mostly dovish, which should see gold supported around the $1,300-area. The focus would be more on the U.S. earnings season due to the absence of China for the whole week.” The dollar held on to recent gains against its peers on Tuesday, supported by the recovery in investor risk appetite. Spot gold rose to its highest since late April at $1,326.30, last week, after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady and said it would be patient on further hikes amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy due to global growth concerns and the U.S.-China trade dispute. However, solid U.S. jobs data that came out on Friday allayed concerns of an immediate slowdown in the U.S. economy. The central bank may need to raise interest rates a bit further if the economy does well, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Monday. “It seems to us that investors will need to get more signals before getting more aggressive in (acquiring long positions in gold), which won’t come until $1,360 or so,” analysts at TD Securities said in a research note. “Despite the fact that the Fed has gone dovish, they could still hike one more time.” Meanwhile, holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, dropped 0.50 percent to 813.29 tonnes on Monday. Holdings have fallen for a second straight session. Among other precious metals, palladium gained 0.2 percent to $1,367 per ounce. Silver rose 0.1 percent to $15.88, while platinum dipped 0.1 percent to $817.00. (Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru; Editing by Joseph Radford)<|im_end|>

# Tulsi Gabbard apologizes, again, for past antigay views

One week after her 2020 presidential rollout, the campaign of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has hit a pothole. Gabbard issued an apology Thursday for antigay views she expressed in the past, attributing them to her conservative upbringing. “In my past, I said and believed things that were wrong,” said Gabbard, who represents Hawaii’s second district in the U.S. House of Representatives. “And worse, they were very hurtful to people in the LGBT community and to their loved ones.” Saying she “grew up in a socially conservative household,” Gabbard explained in her video that she was “raised to believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman,” although she said that she has always believed that every person was created equal in God’s eyes. “So, for a period of my life, I didn’t see the contradiction in those beliefs,” Gabbard said, explaining that she was raised by a father, Mike Gabbard, who was a legislator and Catholic activist “fighting against gay rights and marriage equality.” Gabbard gravitated toward Hinduism, her mother’s religion, as a teenager. When she was a teenager, Gabbard also joined her father’s effort to pass a constitutional amendment in Hawaii to ban gay marriage, and when she was elected to Hawaii’s state legislature in 2001, at the age of 21, she continued that fight. In 2012, when Gabbard ran for Congress, she apologized for her antigay advocacy. Her latest apology comes six days after she announced her presidential candidacy. Gabbard is not well-known nationally, and in a survey conducted in December of liberal activists, she earned only 2 percent support. At a time when Gabbard’s main campaign focus is to raise her profile and introduce herself to voters, the focus on her past could reduce her appeal to voters. A 2018 Gallup poll found that 83 percent of Democrats supported the legalization of gay marriage. “My views have changed significantly since then, and my record in Congress over the last six years reflects what is in my heart,” Gabbard said in her video. ____ Read more from Yahoo News: House ‘will open up money-laundering inquiry’ into Trump-Russia ties The shutdown is about to get worse for federal workers Will the House Progressive Caucus play ball — or hardball — with Pelosi? 8 heartwarming things that happened in 2018 Can a wall stop drugs?

Historically, Netflix shows and movies become available at 3 a.m. Eastern on the release date (12 a.m. Pacific).

10:01 a.m. Eastern Europe Summer Time The Season Will Include Original Songs from Composer Alana De Fonseca  According to the streaming giant’s official description, the animated series will continue telling stories that take place after the popular film starring Justin Timberlake. “Picking up where the film left off, the Netflix original series is an all-new chapter in the the endlessly upbeat adventures of the Trolls as Poppy, Branch and all of Troll Village keep the party going in their fantastical forest home,” the website states.  Animation Magazine also provides some insight into some of the episode’s main plot points. “Queen Poppy decides to create a new Bergen-free Troll anthem… Guy Diamond loses his glitter, and all of Troll Village comes together to celebrate the one day it snows with an epic Snow Day,” they reveal. The season will also delve into the identity of the mysterious Mr. Glittercakes.  Romper also reports that there will be a subplot involving the character Branch and her discovery of a sack of eggs in the forest. The eggs reportedly hatch into three adorable chicks, forcing Branch into the role of parent. Like the film upon which it was based, Trolls: The Beat Goes On features original songs. This time, the songwriting duties go to Alana Da Fonseca. Da Fonseca was the executive music producer on Pitch Perfect 3, which starred Trolls voice actress Anna Kendrick.<|im_end|>

# The 5 Best Apps For Freelance Designers

Managing your time and money is tough with any job, but going freelance will inevitably increase the frustration–and the necessity–tenfold. The organizational infrastructure that often goes unnoticed and underappreciated at a full-time job is suddenly obvious once it’s missing. Processing business expenses, delineating work hours, saving for income taxes–it’s all on you. But this is 2016, so it goes without saying that there are about a million apps for each hurdle you might encounter. We narrowed it down to our favorite five. We didn’t include tools for the actual designing–for that you should head over to Khoi Vinh’s Subtraction blog–just apps that help manage the business side of things. But yes, we did factor in clean and clever interface design. Boomerang has been around since 2011, but it’s such a simple, useful plug-in that it hasn’t gone out of style. For freelancers working weird hours, it’s especially handy: The Gmail plug-in let’s you schedule your emails to be delivered during regular work hours, so you don’t pester people at 11 p.m. You can schedule your own messages to repost at the top of your inbox, unread, to serve as a reminder to follow up. A new feature will rate your email’s strength based on things like subject length, word count, and politeness, though that seems like overkill. You never think you’ll miss your office’s clunky Xeroxes until you’re without them, and you need to print, sign, and scan a contract with a new client. Going to FedEx is always a terrible experience, and the expense adds up. HelloSign is another Gmail plug-in that lets you fill out and sign forms and contracts from your computer, then send them back, all without leaving your Gmail browser. (Or your house.) There are plenty of to-do list apps out there, but TeuxDeux is beautifully designed and exceedingly simple. Add your daily tasks in a list under the date, click to erase them when you’re done, and add more long-term tasks in a list at the bottom. It’s essentially a digital version of a pen and paper to-do list, which is all you really need, except that it’s always with you. TeuxDeux is the brain child of design blogger Swiss Miss, and will cost you a subscription fee of $3 a month. Poor time and money management can be the downfall of any freelance designer, and Cushion can help with both. The app manages projects by visualizing your upcoming schedule from a bird’s-eye view then allowing you to zoom in on a specific task or day. It will alert you when you’re overbooked. And a new invoicing feature, now in beta, will offer a sharp-looking template, allowing you to enter your rates and expenses, calculate the tax, then save it into a PDF ready to send out to clients. Budgeting personal finances is crucial for a freelancer: If you have a slow month or your clients don’t pay you on time, you want something to fall back on. Plus, taxes sneak up on you when they aren’t getting taken out of your pay check incrementally. Setting aside money for taxes and accruing a savings is as easy as setting up an automatic transfer through online banking, but Digit will help keep you accountable for saving a little more when you can afford it. Using an algorithm generated through your personal settings, the app takes money out of your spending account and puts it in your savings–but the amount it transfers depends on the state of your finances. If you’ve been spending a lot, it will take out less, but if you’ve just had a good project load it will put more aside for a rainy day. Sometimes, the apps know best.<|im_end|>

# GRAPHIC VIDEO: Alabama hunter fires 2 rounds at buck just yards away from fishermen

The hunter made two errors: It is illegal to remove a deer from the state’s waters and firing into the water where fishermen could be considered reckless endangerment, a law enforcement agent told WRBL.com. The official said that the hunter's actions were "disappointing." The buck was crossing Lake Mitchell in Clanton, Ala., Todd Stephens, one of the fishermen, told the station. Andrew Guy, another fisherman, said he was glad the guys the nearby boat were OK. He said they were all shaken up after the two shots were fired. "Then the hunter had the never to come back and yell down the hill asking if the buck had run back down towards us. He didn't even know he was breaking the law," Guy told the station.<|im_end|>

# North Charleston's Ashley Phosphate railroad crossing will close again Wednesday morning

North Charleston police on Tuesday said that the railroad crossing at Ashley Phosphate Road, which was closed in the morning, will re-open around 4 p.m., ahead of rush hour traffic. The crossing was closed to allow for maintenance work, and motorists were detoured to Northside Drive, Weber Boulevard and onto Palmetto Commerce Parkway. The crossing will again be closed first thing Wednesday morning around 5 a.m. so that maintenance crews may continue their work. No timeline concerning how long the maintenance work will take has been provided by Norfolk Southern Corp., the Virginia-based company contracted by the city to perform the repairs. A spokesperson for the company could not immediately be reached on Tuesday for additional information. The repairs follow North Charleston officials' complaints that the uneven and bumpy crossing was to blame for accidents and vehicle damage. Workers are replacing 14.4 miles of rail between Charleston and Summerville and could take up to several weeks or longer, a Norfolk Southern representative previously said.<|im_end|>

# Bathurst 12 Hour: Bentley's Soucek takes blame for 'amateur' errors

Andy Soucek admits he accidentally pressed the kill switch twice on the #108 Bentley Continental while leaving the pitlane during the Bathurst 12 Hour, costing the squad a victory chance. Soucek rolled to a halt at the pitlane exit twice during today's race with the first time coming just after the two-hour mark when he had first taken over the car. At the Bentley's final pitstop Soucek repeated the error and, instead of slotting into second with then-leader Jake Dennis in sight, he ended up rejoining in seventh and more than a minute off the lead. He had also earned a mid-race drive-through for passing a car before the control line on a restart. Soucek told Autosport he owed his team-mates an apology for twice hitting the switch located on the steering wheel. "I'm gutted," he said. "We travelled around the world to come to Bathurst. "Everything was ready, my team-mates did a mega job, the strategy and car was there. "Sometimes you don't have a good day, and it wasn't a good day for me personally. "I drove well, but I made way too many mistakes. "In all of my stints I did something. "I got a drivethrough for passing a car before the line - a slow car, the differential in speed was way too high - but it was my fault. "I should have waited. "And then I pressed the stop button twice going out of the pits. The car stopped and I had to make full reset, so all of the blame is on me. "I want to apologise for my team, who did a great job, and my team-mates. "It's going to be a tough 20-hour flight home." Soucek said he could not blame Bentley for an operational error because the drivers requested the kill switch button. "I don't want to blame the car," he said. "We asked to put a button on the steering wheel to be able to stop the car quicker. "It never happened before. Sometimes you just have that bad luck where it's not your day. "And I hit it twice. I don't know what to say. It's an amateur mistake. "I've won most of the championships I did myself in single-seaters, I'm experienced in GTs, so it shouldn't happen. "I'm disappointed in myself. "I can't blame anyone for putting the button there, it's for us to stop the car. My fault." Soucek admitted that the Bentley was in contention to win the race without his error. "We would have been seven seconds behind the Aston going out of the pits if I didn't hit the button," he said. "Then there was this [late] safety car and I probably could have had a chance to overtake him the same way [Matt] Campbell did at the end. "I don't know if we would have won, but we would have been in contention for sure because we had good straightline speed and the car was mega."

# Maduro Rejects Election "Ultimatums", Warns Trump Will Leave White House "Stained With Blood" If Venezuela Invaded

Less than twenty-four hours after telling thousands of supporters that he "agreed" and was "committed to holding parliamentary elections this year," as demanded by the National Assembly...   "They (the opposition) want to bring forward elections, let's have elections," he said defiantly just ahead of the Sunday deadline set by European nations to hold fresh presidential elections, though he stopped short of any reference to fresh presidential elections.  ...embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has flip-flopped rather aggressively, warning Donald Trump he will leave the White House “stained with blood” if he insists on pursuing what he called a “dirty” imperialist conspiracy to overthrow him.  Perhaps Maduro's newfound resistance was sparked by support he witnessed yesterday (as John Bolton continued his interventionist threats)...   While millions of #Venezuelan people are protesting against #Maduro in support of Juan #Guaido in tens of cities and towns, a few thousand supporters of #Maduro are gathered in Avenue Bolivar at #Caracas as a part of a propaganda counter protest. pic.twitter.com/ZnLYOx92XI — Babak Taghvaee (@BabakTaghvaee) February 2, 2019  “Stop. Stop, Trump! Hold it right there! You are making mistakes that will leave your hands covered in blood and you will leave the presidency stained with blood,”  “Why would you want a repeat of Vietnam?”  Maduro clearly signalled that he had no plans to go anywhere...   “If the north American empire attacks us, we will have to defend ourselves... We aren’t going to hand Venezuela over..."  However, Maduro admitted he was facing a “tough” fight against powerful opponents, but was not backing down...   “They use sledgehammers instead of boxing gloves,” Maduro said of the US, which he claimed was seeking to topple him to seize Venezuela’s oil.  “But it’s like David against Goliath,” Maduro went on. “We have our secrets too – and we have our sling. David’s sling is in our hands.”  Maduro also sent a message to his opposition challenger Guaidó:   “Think carefully about what you are doing,” he said, urging Guaidó “to abandon his coup-mongering strategy”.  The democratically-elected Venezuelan president also rejected European calls for elections, saying:   “We don’t accept ultimatums from anyone. I refuse to call for elections now – there will be elections in 2024. We don’t care what Europe says.”  Adding, “you can’t base international politics on ultimatums. That’s the stuff of the empire, of colonial times.”  Speaking to CBS on Sunday, Trump said he had rejected talks with Maduro “because so many really horrible things have been happening in Venezuela”.   Asked if military action was possible, he replied: “Well I don’t want to say that. But certainly it’s something that’s on the – it’s an option.”  Seems like it is time for Trump to unleash a "fire and fury" tweet to get things back on the diplomatic track.<|im_end|>

# 'Officers feared for their lives': Greenough prison guards speak out

Two Greenough prison officers have spoken publicly for the first time about the day inmates trashed and destroyed the jail, with one describing it as harrowing, extremely frightening and something they never want to go through again. The male and female prison officers have revealed some of their colleagues have not been able to return to work since the riot - which caused $2.4 million damage - because they're suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. "The many emotions staff have experienced from that night have manifested in different ways including, anger, loss of trust in the system, stress and PTSD," one officer said. The pair spoke out this week to coincide with National Corrections Day on Friday, a day which recognises prison workers across the country. An independent report into the Greenough riot ruled an increase in lockdowns and staff shortfalls were some of the factors which contributed to the disturbance and breakout of 10 inmates on July 24/25. The female prison officer who spoke this week said she had never seen anything like the riot as it was unfolding before her. "We were watching the prisoners on camera during the riot trying to break lights so that the prison officers couldn’t see what they were doing next," she said. "It was an extremely frightening situation for those four hours before reinforcements arrived. "At one point of the riot I was stationed at the gate house and answered a call from female prisoners who were locked inside and could smell the toxic smoke coming from the fire. It was the worst feeling in the world not being able to go in and help them. "It is still hard to talk about without getting upset, but I felt helpless and all I could do was to try and comfort them over the cell call system, tell them they were safe and to take a deep breath and get down on the floor. "Officers feared for their lives, we are all so extremely lucky no one was seriously injured or killed and I believe that is because we all banded together, looked out for each other and acted quickly by removing risks such as knives from the kitchens." The female officer said she was fearful a similar event could occur in the future. “I fear it could happen again, I am still not confident the prison will be safe once it is back up to full capacity and many officers share my opinion," she said. "I never want to go through anything like that again." The male Greenough officer said some staff had managed to return to work soon after the event, while others had not been able to. "We currently have no idea when they will return , if ever," he said. "The general public do not know a lot about what our job involves. "Police officers are the white knights who swoop in when criminals strike and they do an amazing job. "But prison officers are the ones who have to work 12-hour days with those criminals that the rest of society doesn’t want to live with. "Somebody has to do it and it takes a special someone to do that job day in and day out.” WA Prison Officers Union secretary Andy Smith described the Greenough riot as a "dreadful day". He said the bravery and professionalism shown by some of the officers at the jail last July was nothing short of extraordinary. Mr Smith said he hoped events like National Corrections Day would prompt people to stop and think for a moment about the work prison officers do. "This is an opportunity to recognise people that work with all the people in the community that nobody wants to be with," he said. "I had an interesting phrase given to me only last week by a police officer that they're the catchers and we are the keepers. "It is an extremely stressful job. The general public don't actually know what they do in there. "Everything prison officers do is hidden behind four walls so this (National Corrections Day) is an opportunity to recognise those officers." The independent report into the riot said it was a credit to the Greenough staff nobody was killed during the disturbance in what was "a chaotic and complex situation. "By all accounts the Greenough prison staff were courageous in their endeavours to contain the incidents ... with preservation of life the priority," the report noted.<|im_end|>

# Deadly disease outbreak across CQ prompts vet warning

Deadly disease outbreak across CQ prompts vet warning  LOCAL vets are urging dog owners to vaccinate their beloved pets after a recent outbreak of parvovirus across Central Queensland. The deadly disease is back with a vengeance, with 17 cases reported at Alma St Vet over the past three weeks, with more expected. Dr Gregory Muir is urging owners to stay vigilant and protect their four-legged friends from a grisly end. "It's certainly been a bit of an outbreak and it's quite a high number,” he said. "But any number is too high. "We haven't seen it for a few months, there haven't been too many cases until three weeks ago.”  The disease is rampant across the region, with cases reported from dogs located in Rockhampton, Gracemere and Mount Morgan. "Scientifically, we don't know at this stage why you tend to get outbreaks but we do,” Dr Muir said. "It may be associated with rainy periods and it gets flushed out and as parvo is a hearty virus, it lives in the ground for a couple of years. "Or it could be that we just get a couple of cases and it tends to spread. "Scientists are researching to look at that situation but it happens in other towns as well. "Although we don't know what starts it, we know when it gets going we are going to get a few cases.”  As the virus can be transmitted easily through exposure to fluids such as vomit and faeces, as well as dirt carried on shoes, the only way to prevent infection is to vaccinate. "You can pick it up easily on your shoes and introduce it into the house because it stays in the ground for quite some time,” Dr Muir said. "Vaccination is highly effective and basically vaccinated dogs are generally fine. "The cornerstone of prevention is to make sure your dog is fully vaccinated and for a puppy that generally means a course of three vaccinations. "Some people will get a puppy that has had one and think they are safe but they need the three as they are the most susceptible to the virus.” Owners should also keep un-vaccinated pets away from areas with lots of dogs, such as dog parks, and consult their vet for what vaccination plan is best for them.  "Some vaccinations can last three years but each individual is a little different,” Dr Muir said. "Generally speaking, dogs are updated with the vaccination yearly. "If your dog is showing signs, the sooner we get them, the better their chances of survival. "We can get the majority through but it's expensive. We often quote $1000-$2000 to save them and, although it's fairly intensive therapy, some dogs cannot be saved. "The treatment is way more expensive than vaccinations and, in all honesty, the disease is just horrible and painful for the dogs. "I couldn't urge owners enough tovaccinate, especially with puppies.” Most infected dogs that die from the disease die from dehydration. Initial signs to look out for are dogs seeming "dull and very quiet”and going off their food, as well as frothy vomit and bloody diarrhoea.<|im_end|>

# Toxic smog forces Bangkok to close hundreds of schools

Toxic smog forced Bangkok authorities to issue an unprecedented order to shut nearly 450 schools on Wednesday as authorities struggled to manage a pollution crisis that has stirred widespread concern.  The Thai capital has been shrouded in murky haze for weeks, forcing residents to don masks and sparking social media criticism of the uneven response by the government.  Reasons given for the lingering pall include exhaust from traffic, unfettered construction, the burning of crop stubble, and pollution from factories getting trapped in the city.  Authorities have seeded clouds to provoke rain, sprayed overpasses with water to catch micro-pollutants and even asked people not to burn incense sticks and paper during Chinese new year celebrations.  The measures so far have provoked derision from many Bangkok residents, while stocks of pollution masks have run out in many shops.  But on Wednesday the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration stepped up its health warnings, ordering all 437 city-controlled public schools to close from lunchtime until Friday, while designating 1,500 square kilometres (580 square miles) of the city a “control area”.  “The situation will be bad until February 3 to 4, so I decided to close schools,” said Bangkok governor Aswin Kwanmuang, adding he hoped the move would also empty the road of cars on the school run.  Three to four of the city’s districts were “severely hit with smog”, he added.  Fleets of drones are set to be deployed to disperse sugary liquid solution to help clear the air of microscopic particles. It is not clear how effective that will be given the scale of the smog cloaking the city.  Aswin also said city hall may soon issue a warning against exercising in parks.  Air Visual, an independent online air quality index (AQI) monitor, on Thursday pegged Bangkok at the “unhealthy” level of 171, up from 156 mid-month.  The measurements are higher than some cities in China but well below the Indian capital New Delhi.  Greenpeace Thailand country director Tara Buakamsri said the levels in Bangkok were the worst in “at least a year”.<|im_end|>

# Dense fog disrupts flight operations at Delhi airport

Dense fog disrupts flight operations at Delhi airport Arrivals and departures have largely been put on hold at Delhi’s IGI airport due to fog. Two flights were also diverted between 5.30 AM and 8.30 AM. New Delhi: Dense fog enveloped several parts of the national capital, leading to disruption in flight operations at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here. Arrivals and departures have largely been put on hold at the IGI airport. Two flights were also diverted between 5.30 AM and 8.30 AM. “Flight operations have largely been put on hold. Very few aircraft are departing and that too on the basis of their size, visibility and ATC (air traffic control) clearance for taking off,” an airport official said. According to the official, departures were completely put on hold from 5.30 AM to 7 AM and arrivals happened only intermittently in between 6 AM to 7.20 AM. Departures were not allowed even after 7 AM due to dense fog. One of the flights diverted from the IGI airport was coming from Singapore. It was diverted to Kolkata, he said. At Delhi, the minimum runway visibility required for take off is 125 metres. The Delhi airport was facing low visibility conditions since 4 AM Friday due to dense fog, the official said. Vistara Airlines tweeted at 8.23 AM on Friday that “due to dense fog and poor visibility in Delhi, delays are expected for both arrivals and departures with likely consequential impact on flights across network”. “Currently, flight departures from Delhi are on hold and will resume by 0930 hrs subject to weather clearance,” it added. Jet Airways also tweeted on 6.33 AM that some of its flights have been affected as there is dense fog at Delhi airport as well as Bengaluru airport.

# William Barr answered 2 questions during his confirmation hearing that could spell trouble for Trump in the Russia investigation

BuzzFeed News published a bombshell report on Thursday night, alleging that President Donald Trump instructed his longtime lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about how long the Trump Tower Moscow deal had been worked on. Following the release of that report, people began sharing a clip from William Barr's confirmation hearing. Barr is Trump's nominee for attorney general. If confirmed, he would oversee the special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia investigation. In an exchange with Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar from Wisconsin, Barr answers questions on what he considers obstruction of justice. During his Tuesday hearing, William Barr, President Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general, answered a series of questions from Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota about obstruction of justice. In June 2018, Barr sent an unsolicited memo about obstruction of justice to the White House. The memo addressed the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election and whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to sway the election in Trump's favor. The memo, which has prompted skepticism from Democrats over Barr's ability to serve as attorney general, questions the scope of Mueller's investigation — and whether the special counsel can probe Trump about obstruction of justice. During the hearing this week, Democrats questioned Barr about the memo — including the following exchange with Klobuchar— and where he did acknowledge that a president can obstruct justice. "In your memo, you talk about the Comey decision and you talk about obstruction of justice, and you already went over that, which I appreciate," Klobuchar says. "You wrote on page one that a president persuading a person to commit perjury would be obstruction. Is that right? "That — yes," Barr replies. "Or any, well any person who persuades another." "You also said that a president — or any person — convincing a witness to change testimony would be obstruction," Klobuchar continues. "Is that right?" "Yes," Barr says. "OK. And on page two you said that a president deliberately impairing the integrity or availability of evidence would be an obstruction?" "Yes," Barr says. "OK. So what if a president told a witness not to cooperate with an investigation or hinted at a pardon?" Klobuchar asks. "I'd have to know the specific — I'd have to know the specific facts," Barr replies. "OK, you wrote on page one that if a president knowingly destroys or alters evidence that would be obstruction." "Yes," Barr says. "OK. So what if the president drafted a misleading statement to conceal the purpose of a meeting?" she asks. "Would that be obstruction?" "Again, I'd have to know the specifics," Barr says. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and who is a close ally to Trump, posed a similar question to Barr: "If there was some reason to believe that the president tried to coach somebody not to testify or to testify falsely that could be obstruction of justice?" "Yes," Barr responded. The exchanges — focused specifically on the first two questions about witnesses — was being shared Thursday night, after a new report from BuzzFeed News alleged that President Donald Trump instructed his longtime lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about how long the Trump Organization was in talks for a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow. If these allegations, told to BuzzFeed News by two law-enforcement sources, prove to be true, this could point to obstruction of justice as Democratic lawmakers pointed out on Twitter.<|im_end|>

# High def on a budget: HD VMD muscles in

While the Blu-ray and HD DVD camps were slugging it out at IFA 2007, British company New Media Enterprises (NME) quietly launched its next-gen high def format - HD VMD, or High Definition Versatile Multilayer Disc. HD VMD uses the same 12cm disc as a regular DVD, but a proprietary manufacturing process increases the number of layers and so adds extra capacity. HD VMD discs typically have a storage capacity of 5GB per layer with triple-layer pre-recorded discs already available. HD VMD even uses similar red laser technology to that found in DVD and is capable of delivering 1080i/1080p video signals at a bit rate of 45Mbps (Megabits per second). It also includes support for Dolby Digital, DTS and Dolby Digital Plus surround sound formats, and NME hopes to add next-gen surround formats like Dolby TrueHD soon. So what does this all mean? HD on the cheap One of the supposed benefits of the HD VMD system is that discs and hardware are incredibly cheap to make. "European consumers have waited for an HD solution at DVD pricing; and with HD VMD, we believe we have met this desire through a stellar quality, high-definition disc and player at a price point that almost anyone can afford," says NME CEO Mahesh Jayanarayan. To prove it, NME has launched its first HD VMD player - the 622 - for just £119, along with five new movie titles. These join a slowly growing content library of 150 titles for Europe that include 16 Blocks, Apocalypto, Passion Of The Christ, Lord Of War, Lucky Number Slevin and We Were Soldiers. Pre-recorded titles cost between £13 and £16 each, around the same as a regular DVD movie. The 622 will also be joined by a higher spec version - dubbed the 777 - before Christmas and will be available from Amazon, Dabs and other online stores. Both players are backwardly compatible with DVDs and include 1080p video upscalers, which Patrick Henningsen - the company's marketing communications director - says "are the best on the market and for the best price". Henningsen also said that the HD VMD format doesn't suffer from any of the problems that plague its Blu-ray and HD DVD rivals - problems like slow loading times, 24p content playback, etc. "We're really excited about taking on a couple of companies [Sony and Toshiba] who already had an early start... We have the advantage because we're a small company and we can concentrate on a market [low cost HD] that's being completely ignored by the big players," says Henningsen. HD VMD specs Disc (single side) HD VMD15 and HD VMD20 Disc Diameter:; 120 mm Disc Thickness: 1.2 mm Laser Wavelength: 650 nm Native Resolution for all models: 1920 x 1080p Video codecs: MPEG- 2, MPEG-1, VC-1, H-264(AVC) Audio codecs: Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, DTS Data transfer rate: 45Mbps Video bit rate: 45Mbps Security: AES, AACS available Additional features: USB port, card reader, HDMI, internet connectivity<|im_end|>

# Dani Dyer 'disappointed' as Jack Fincham confesses cocaine binge

The reality star has spoken out on the pressures of fame  The reality star shot to fame last summer when he won the ITV2 reality show alongside 21-year-old Dani.  But in a candid new interview, 26-year-old Jack has now revealed the downside of being in the public eye after he gave in to the pressure of constantly being offered drugs.  ‘I’m in a new world of partying and stuff, and being in circles that I would never normally have been in,’ he said.  ‘I’d never normally be in these situations but, yes, since winning the show I have been offered cocaine a lot.’  Recalling a night out with his Love Island pals Adam Collard and Sam Bird over the weekend, the star continued to The Sun: ‘I went out all night, I was drinking and I just got carried away and made a stupid, stupid mistake which I wish I’d never done, you know. I regret it.’  After admitting to snorting cocaine in the early hours of the morning, Jack continued: ‘That night, it was a complete error in judgment. It’s a silly thing to do, it’s not something I’ve made a habit of. I mean, what an idiot.  ‘It’s not a reflection of my character, but I’ve had a blowout. It was a lapse in judgment, but it’s not something that I’ll ever do again.’  Owning up to his mistakes, Jack has since confessed the slip up to girlfriend Dani, who is said to have been ‘disappointed’ by her boyfriend’s actions.  ‘I’ve told Dani, and obviously she doesn’t agree with anything like that at all,’ he said. ‘She doesn’t like all that. But obviously she’ll always support me.  ‘She said, “I’ll always support you, you made a mistake, we all make mistakes, but don’t ever do it again”. I don’t want to bring her into it, I’ve had a conversation with her and it’s not fair on her.’  Asked what Dani’s dad Danny Dyer would think about his confession, Jack said the EastEnders actor would ‘take a dim view’ of his wild night out.  ‘It will never happen again but I’m pretty sure any parent would take the same view on it,’ he said.  ‘I’ve made a mistake and I’m sorry for it and that’s the truth.’<|im_end|>

# Becky Lynch attacks Stephanie McMahon after suspension from WWE

Bengaluru, February 5: Becky Lynch started this week’s WWE Raw in the most heated way possible to prove yet again why she is the hottest property in sports entertainment now. What was a formal invitation to the flagship show, turned into a brawl inside the ring albeit to the pleasure of the fans. In the process, The Man got herself suspended from WWE.  WWE Raw kicked off last night with Stephanie McMahon's return to the show after a gap of almost two months. She was indeed happy to introduce the #1 contender for the RAW Women's Championship, Becky Lynch. After congratulating The Man for her achievements, Stephanie went on to address a bigger issue.  Becky Lynch has suffered a knee injury at Royal Rumble thanks to Nia Jax and that worsened during a brawl with Charlotte Flair on last week's Smackdown. After that Becky Lynch was reluctant to receive any medical attention from the doctors just because she did not want to go on any further hiatus.  Stephanie McMahon demanded her to follow WWE’s policy and immediately go for a check-up. Or else, she threatened to suspend her. But, The Irish Lass-Kicker disobeyed the orders which prompted McMahon announce her suspension. An irate Becky Lynch pounced on the Billion Dollar Princess from behind and attacked Stephanie in the turnbuckle area.  She tried to lock in the dis-arm-her on the commissioner, but the security personnel ran out to stop her. A number of security guards were also out inside the ring and they also received some shots from the fired-up contender. She was ultimately escorted out of the arena, but not before a verbal confrontation broke out between her and Ronda Rousey in the backstage.  For now, Becky Lynch will have to stay out of action as per the updates from WWE.com which are as follows,  “Stephanie McMahon suspended Becky Lynch until The Man has her injured left knee examined and cleared by WWE medical personnel. On the night she won the 30-Woman Royal Rumble Match, which she parlayed into a Raw Women’s Championship opportunity against Ronda Rousey at WrestleMania, Lynch sustained a knee injury and has required a brace ever since.”  It looks like 2019 Royal Rumble winner might return to in-ring action only for the Wrestlemania 35 main event when she challenges Ronda Rousey for the WWE Raw women’s championship.<|im_end|>

# The Best Selling Gaming Accessories on Amazon That You Absolutely Need

Scouted By The Beast Clean up your gaming space and stylize your experience with function and umph. Scouted By The Beast An old friend of mine who briefly played video games competitively scoffs at any mention of console games and swears playing on a PC is the only true way to do so — you know the type. But the spread and popularity of consoles begs to differ with him and whoever popped into your mind. Whatever poison — er, platform — you choose, accessories are tantamount to your experience. An old or slowly breaking controller will negate the most advanced graphics and leave a sour taste in your mouth. Whether it’s time for an upgrade or you’re looking to add flavor and nuance to your gaming life, we scanned the best selling video game accessories to give you an idea of the peripheral enhancements lying at your fingertips. No matter what you’re playing or how, hearing the action is crucial to the experience. The Cloud Stinger Gaming Headset from HyperX packs 90-degree rotating cups and noise cancellation for less than $50, not to mention a swivel-to-mute microphone so you can quickly vocalize your masterplan and get right onto executing it. Another option that works on any platform is RUNMUS’s best selling Gaming Headset, packing all the essential heat for under $30. Keep in mind these are both wired sets. Now on to the platforms. The Playstation 4 is my platform of choice. I love the controller that came with the console itself (I got mine in the days of the first Destiny but a Spider-Man themed slim edition of the console is currently selling for $333). If I still needed a second controller, I’d be eyeing the Midnight Blue because it’s really very pretty, and yet serious in a way that commands respect — gamers, amirite? And don’t be that person whose living room is crossed by charging cables — graduate from that, friends. I recommend the best selling Dual USB Fast Charging Station Stand from Megadream. I wasn’t surprised at all when I saw the Xbox One selling a Minecraft bundle for $229 — a family member recently bought the console specifically to assuage children with that game. And just like the Playstation, this console also leaves you scrambling with just one controller in the box so be sure you shelf a second one before you need it. And no, Xbox gamers are no better than Playstation ones when it comes to strewn cables. The charging station from Minnesotan company Fosmon comes with two battery packs that store more than 30 hours of standby charge. The whole thing runs you less than $30. A Pro Controller for the Switch is essential — you should at least peak at the striking design on the Xenoblade 2 Chronicles Edition. If you haven’t played the game, do yourself a favor. Of course, be sure to protect your investment when you’re traveling with amFILM’s best selling screen protector and Orzly’s Switch-compatible carrying case. I wish I was a dedicated Pokémon player if only to be able to sport the best selling Poké Ball Plus and persuade my friends to also invest in the $50 sphere so we can get really (really) into it during bouts of Nintendo’s Switch staples Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! Amazon’s best sellers include much more in the way of consoles than PCs, but a few notables are worth mentioning. The highly rated gaming mouse from PICTEK gives you seven programmable buttons for just $15. Logitech’s $50 Proteus Spectrum RGB Tunable Gaming Mouse has a long name and a likewise long list of features: custom weight and balance tuning, 11 custom buttons, and an adjustable scroll wheel, to mention a few. Both of those are wired. Finally is a keyboard from Redragon. About $30 gets you a splash-proof design with red back lighting that’s adjustable. A white version is similarly priced but full RGB backlighting is a bit pricier investment with a choice between black keys and white keys. Whatever platform you’re on or game you’re playing, do so intentionally with the right peripherals for any occasion. Scouted is internet shopping with a pulse.

# Slash Releases New Concert Film As A BitTorrent Bundle, Global Headbanging Commences

Axe master. Hair farmer. Tech innovator. Yep, Slash is the latest artist to experiment with digital content distribution outside proprietary storefronts like iTunes and other on-demand services. The former Guns N’ Roses guitarist has just released Live at the Roxy 9/25/14, a concert film with his solo band featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators, as a BitTorrent Bundle, a direct-to-consumer download using BitTorrent’s peer-to-peer technology. “There’s so much going on right now, there’s no one format that everybody uses anymore,” Slash tells Fast Company from a tour stop in Hamburg, Germany, for his third solo album, World On Fire. “Us musicians who do this want to facilitate people getting our music however they want to get it. It’s like the Wild West out there, there’s no one main avenue.” Bundle, whose early adopters were independent musicians, has gained traction this year in the video space–initially, film studios used it primarily to distribute supplementary content, but BitTorrent has recently released two feature films–David Cross’s HITS and Drafthouse Films’ Spring), as well as a Doctor Who 10-episode box set with the BBC. Unlike a storefront or service, BitTorrent Bundle is a download-only product that protects multimedia content behind a gate that can be unlocked for a price set by the publisher and promoted on any site or platform. The gate travels with the content as it is shared. Files are DRM-free, and the artist or publisher keeps all revenue except for transaction costs and BitTorrent’s 10% cut. This means that Slash and any co-copyright holders will keep most of the $15.99 download price for every Bundle. In addition to the film’s digital download, Live at the Roxy 9/25/14 is also available on physical Blu-ray and DVD, as well as audio-only on vinyl, CD, or digital formats, at all major retailers through Eagle Rock Entertainment. “It was a nostalgic kind of a thing,” says Slash about the performance at the Roxy in West Hollywood, one of four small club performances just after the release of World On Fire. “All four [shows] were wild gigs. The whole reason behind recording one of them at least was to be able to capture that vibe of a small, intimate setting, packed to the rafters, loud and boisterous. We didn’t have plans to make a live record, we just thought it would be good to memorialize that little period.” Slash is also using his output around World On Fire to support the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and raise awareness about the slaughter of elephants as a result of the ivory trade. “We had written a song [“Beneath the Savage Sun”] that was through an elephant’s eyes about what’s going on with the elephant population as a result of the ivory trade,” says Slash. “It was inspired by a trip to Africa. This issue has always been important to me.” Fans can download the song for free with a donation to the organization, and Slash and Kennedy created a video last month to further IFAW’s efforts.<|im_end|>

# Call for tougher sanctions for cable theft | Cape Argus

These are the views of the Cape Chamber of Commerce and the United National Transport Union (Untu) after incidents in Durban and Nyanga.  In Durban, Metrorail train driver François Gouws was shot at at Umbogintwini station. On Sunday, a train was petrol-bombed and looted at Orient Hills near Krugersdorp, west of Joburg, while on the same day, at the Nyanga substation, a security vehicle was shot at on the notorious Central Line. The bullet went through the windscreen.  Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Janine Myburgh said: “The chamber has campaigned for years for copper and cable theft to be treated as major crimes, even as sabotage.  “What makes the situation so serious is that stealing R500 worth (scrap value) of copper and cable theft can do many thousand of rand worth of damage. Replacement costs are high, and there is the huge cost of the disruption they cause. This makes it different and much more serious than other forms of theft.”  Myburgh said cable theft had much greater consequences, and a charge such as sabotage would justify treating it as a serious crime and not simple vandalism.  “Thieves have been getting away with cable theft for years, and until they are made to believe that the law will find them, they will continue to steal,” she said.  Untu announced that it was going to launch a Nedlac 77 process through its affiliated federation, which will allow protest action to be used to force the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) and Minister of Transport Dr Blade Nzimande to find solutions to the ongoing attacks on Untu members.  Political analyst Ralph Mathekga said the focus and sabotage charges should be for scrap dealers. “The guys who take the cables are the vulnerable guys, the addicts; harsher measures should be exerted on those who create an economy for this. They are the ones who benefit the most and have more knowledge - prosecute them with sabotage.” @Zoey_Dano Cape Argus<|im_end|>

# MK:U International Design Competition

The MK:U International Design Competition seeks world-class design teams for a new model university in the Oxford to Cambridge innovation arc. Beloved by architects as the most original and successful of the mid-twentieth century’s wave of ‘New Towns’, and famously ‘different by design’, Milton Keynes (MK) has successfully reinvented itself as a ‘Smart City’ and is a key contributor to the United Kingdom’s knowledge economy. This success has highlighted the need for a university — MK is the largest urban area in the UK without its own university — and to resolve this, MKC and Cranfield University, a global leader for postgraduate education and transformational research in technology and management, joined forces last year. Their intention is to transform thinking about higher education and create a new exemplar that is open, accessible, dynamic, technologically-focused, innovative, diverse, business-oriented and entrepreneurial. Through its ambitious curriculum focused on digital economy skills, MK:U will honour the innovative spirit of nearby Bletchley Park, the birthplace of modern computing, and further MK’s pioneering work in ‘Big Data’, transport innovation and urban design. Headline subjects include robotics and artificial intelligence; digital and cyber; smart cities; business and entrepreneurship; and design thinking. MK:U will go beyond the scope of a traditional university, using its own University Quarter and the wider city as a ‘living lab’ to test out new concepts and ideas, and inspire MK’s students and citizens. MK:U is one of the flagship projects of the MK Futures 2050 programme, which supports MKC’s ambition to create a city of opportunity for all. It is expected to open to its first students — undergraduates, returners and mature learners — by 2023. All three phases are due to complete within 15 years, when the university will serve 15,000 students. The MK:U International Design Competition is a two-stage competition comprised of an open Expression of Interest followed by a design period for a shortlist of five teams. Collaboration between established and emerging talent, and between UK and international talent, is strongly encouraged by the university. Creative teams, led by an architect, should, as a minimum, include: urban designer/masterplanner, landscape architect, structural engineer, civil/utilities engineer, and MEP (services) engineer. Internationally-based teams will be required to propose a UK-based executive architect as part of their team. Stage one criteria include a demonstration of qualifications: company information; details of your proposed team; and your relevant experience. Shortlisted teams will create an overall masterplan for the site as well as concept designs for 61,120sqm of built area in phase one; this phase has a construction budget of approximately £188m. An honorarium of £30,000 will be paid to each shortlisted team that submits a compliant tender. A technical panel will review the entries and produce a report for the jury, who will conduct interviews and select a winner. The international jury (full details to be announced later) will be chaired by Sir Peter Gregson, Chief Executive and Vice-Chancellor of Cranfield University and chair of the MK Futures 2050 Commission. There will be a public exhibition (physical and online) of all the second-stage designs before the jury meets. The winner announcement is expected in summer 2019.

# Zach Witman, who fatally stabbed brother in southern York County, is granted parole

On Feb. 8, 2018, Zachary Witman admitted to murdering his 13-year-old brother Gregory nearly 20 years earlier. This is how he explained what happened. Sean Heisey, York Daily Record On Oct. 2, 1998, Zach Witman, who was 15, stabbed and slashed his brother, Greg, to death at their home in New Freedom. He's first eligible to be released on May 21. Zach Witman, who fatally stabbed his 13-year-old brother in a killing that shocked and horrified the idyllic bedroom community of New Freedom, on Friday was granted parole. Witman, 35, of New Freedom, is first eligible to be released on May 21. He must fulfill requirements and remain misconduct free. The Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole cited his participation in and competition of prescribed institutional programs; positive institutional behavior; and recommendations from the Department of Corrections and prosecuting attorney. On Oct. 2, 1998, Witman, who was 15, stabbed and slashed his brother, Greg, more than 100 times with a penknife after he got home from school. The attack nearly decapitated him. In 2003, Witman was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He maintained his innocence for almost 20 years. His parents, Ron and Sue, have supported him, raising questions about the evidence in the case. In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court made retroactive a ruling that it's unconstitutional to hand down mandatory life sentences for those who commit crimes before they turn 18. Witman was entitled to be resentenced in the case. But Samuel Encarnacion, Witman’s new attorney, discovered that a plea agreement had not been conveyed to his client before trial. Common Pleas Judge Michael E. Bortner threw out the conviction and sentence in the case. Instead of having a new trial, Witman pleaded guilty to third-degree murder in exchange for a sentence of 15 years and 230 days to 40 years in prison. “Yes, I can say I killed my brother by stabbing,” he said. This is a developing story. Check back later for more information. Contact Dylan Segelbaum at 717-771-2102.

# Warwickshire vets warn dog owners to be vigilant after outbreak of potentially lethal disease

A vets in Warwickshire is warning dog owners to be vigilant after a confirmed outbreak of a potentially-lethal condition in the county.  Avonvale Veterinary Centres has issued the warning in the wake of several confirmed cases of parvovirus, a viral infection which is extremely contagious and often leads to death if left untreated. The outbreak has been confirmed around the Shipston-on-Stour area and owners are being urged to ensure their dogs’ vaccines are up-to-date to keep them protected. Mark Taylor, clinical director at Avonvale, said: “Parvovirus can affect dogs of all breeds and age and spreads through direct contact or infected faeces. Affected dogs can even spread the virus after recovery for up to eight weeks. “Symptoms include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, uncontrollable vomiting and diarrhoea, often with blood. “Unfortunately, the virus is highly resistant and can remain in the environment for many months outside. “It’s important to spread the word about this virus so that more dog owners can be aware of its severity, take precautions and be able to spot the symptoms.” The best way to protect against parvovirus is to have dogs vaccinated as puppies, with an additional booster vaccination usually done at one year of age. “If you think your dog is displaying any symptoms of parvovirus, get in touch with your local vet straight away. There is an instant test that can be done on a faecal sample or swabs, so treatment can be started immediately,” said Mark. Avonvale Veterinary Centres has branches in Warwick, Stratford, Kenilworth, Southam, Wellesbourne, Heathcote and Cubbington.<|im_end|>

# Hamilton-area Conservative MPP says concerns about Bill 66 are unfounded - Hamilton | Globalnews.ca

Hamilton-area Conservative MPP says concerns about Bill 66 are unfounded  Hamilton’s voice in the provincial government says concerns about Bill 66, a series of controversial planning changes, are “absolutely unfounded.” Flamborough-Glanbrook Progressive Conservative MPP Donna Skelly says the changes are designed to cut red tape and make Ontario “open for business” by helping municipalities to attract and retain major employers.  She insists they will “absolutely not” override environmental or health legislation, adding that her government has been “very, very clear that we are going to protect the Greenbelt.” City of Hamilton planners have outlined concerns about “potential unintended consequences” of Bill 66, titled the Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, including the risk of encouraging development within the Golden Horseshoe’s swath of protected agricultural and natural land.  Skelly counters that while the changes will in no way “impact the provisions that are in place to protect our water, our lakes” or the Greenbelt, they will give municipalities “a bigger seat at the table.” If passed, the province, developers and municipalities could, in theory, bypass some regulations, provided a development could prove it would create jobs and generate an economic benefit.  Skelly says she has heard from many businesses that it currently takes too long to get anything done in Ontario, adding: “We have to create a more competitive environment.”  © 2019 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.<|im_end|>

# 'Liam Neeson insists he's not a racist - but his use of words speaks volumes'

Liam Neeson gave one of the most explosive, career-ending interviews I have ever heard when he told a journalist he wanted to murder a black person, after someone close to him was raped.  He revealed he wasn’t trying to track down the actual perpetrator who had committed this hideous crime. He didn’t want to kill that person for what he did. Neither was he looking for convicted rapists to take revenge on.  No, Neeson wanted to find ANY black person who so much as looked at him the wrong way and kill them. Not just beat them up, but actually murder them. He specifically asked his friend this question about her attacker: “What colour were they?”  He’s now furiously back-pedalling and telling anyone who will listen that he is not racist – no doubt with one eye on the effect his comments will have at the box office. It is easy to apologise when there is money at stake.  But what am I supposed to think when, even now, he uses the words “black b*****d” when he is talking about his potential victims?  It does not matter they were said with “air-quotes” and he made inverted commas with his fingers as he said them.  The fact he felt it was OK to use the phrase speaks volumes about his lack of understanding of racism and shows how far he still has go to understand the power of his past thoughts and actions. Neeson has admitted he walked around with a cosh for a whole week trying to find someone to attack.  I find this utterly terrifying, sickening and really saddening. That he could have killed someone’s innocent father, son, brother, uncle meant nothing to him.  That is partly what is so hideous and dangerous about racism. It is wrong and irrational. There is absolutely no reason to hate someone because of the colour of their skin, but sadly people do.  Innocent people die as a result. Just ask the parents of Stephen Lawrence.<|im_end|>

# 'I have more confidence than last year': A healthy Yu Darvish eyes his return to dominance with the Cubs

Eleven years ago, Yu Darvish was in his own universe. “Darvish only spoke in Japanese,” recalled Cubs assistant hitting coach Terrmel Sledge, a teammate of Darvish with the Nippon Ham Fighters of the Japan Pacific League for two seasons. “He was 21 and young. We foreigners spotted him and we recognized that year he really wants to be the best. “He was in his own world, and that’s the first perspective you had on him. He really wanted to be the best.” With a surgically repaired right arm, Darvish is eyeing a return to dominance that made him one of the marquee free-agent starters last offseason, leading to him signing a six-year, $126 million contract with the Cubs.  At the Cubs Convention last month, Darvish appeared to be more comfortable than he did last season, speaking in English without an interpreterwhile discussing optimism about contributing — thanks to a healthy right elbow. Team President Theo Epstein emphasized two months ago that the Cubs hired Sledge, who played with Darvish in 2008-09, exclusively to aid hitting coach Anthony Iapoce and not because of his association with Darvish. “I have more confidence than last year,” said Darvish, who agreed to terms with the Cubs only five days before their first spring workout and was nagged by a stomach virus for parts of the first three weeks. Posts to Darvish social media accounts this offseason showed him throwing off a mound with a fluid delivery at full speed. Nevertheless, this represents the biggest challenge of Darvish’s career, at least since he made his Nippon Professional Baseball debut less than a year after graduating from Tohoku High School.  The Cubs rotation fell short of manager Joe Maddon’s proclamation last spring that it could be the best in his four seasons with the team, in part because injuries limited Darvish to eight starts. His discomfort initially was diagnosed in late June as an impingement in his right elbow, then a stress reaction in late July after an abbreviated minor-league rehab start, eventually leading to season-ending surgery in September to remove debris. Also, a wrist cramp shortened his Cubs debut to 4 1/3 innings against an inexperienced Marlins team, and he was pulled from his penultimate start against the Braves on May 15 after only 61 pitches because of a right leg cramp despite striking out five in four innings. Epstein, meanwhile, took no chances as he pursued and acquired left-hander Cole Hamels from the Rangers on July 27 — more than three weeks before Darvish was ruled out for the season. And Darvish’s injuries and Tyler Chatwood’s struggles forced the Cubs to pick up Hamels’ $20 million team option for 2019.  But Hamels’ return, while solidifying the rotation, left the Cubs with no room to make major upgrades, as they did the last four offseasons.  Kyle Hendricks and Hamels believe a healthy Darvish could be a difference-maker. “It was unfortunate the year he had to go through,” Hendricks said. “It was tough having to watch him and go through that mentally. You feel bad for him. But he feels awesome, he’s healthy and he’s throwing a bit. It’s obviously great to hear.” Before the Cubs shut Darvish down, he displayed snippets of his past dominance. He struck out 17 and allowed five hits in 12 innings covering two April starts against the National League Central rival Brewers and struck out seven and allowed two hits in six innings in a win against the Reds in his final start May 20. “I know he wants to do very well, and he’s capable of so much,” said Hamels, who played with Darvish during the 2016-17 seasons with the Rangers. “He’s really good and can carry a month of starts for a team. “So to put him between all of us and working together, it’s going to be a lights-out rotation. I know he’s ready to do it. And if he’s healthy, he’s one of the best in the game.” Left-handed batters hit .276 with a .368 on-base percentage and .474 slugging percentage against Darvish in 2018, compared with a .195/.315/.377 slash line against right-handed hitters. Darvish has six pitches but has relied less on his fastball and curve and more on his slider and cut fastball over the last three seasons, according to the Bill James Handbook. Darvish isn’t sure if the nagging discomfort in his elbow influenced his choice of pitches but said, “I want to change the percentage.” “I will be meeting with (coach) Mike Borzello,” Darvish said in a convincing tone.

# Caught on camera: Porch pirate throws package back as family dog scares him away

SALT LAKE CITY (KSTU/CNN) - Though one Utah family’s 9-year-old black Labrador is usually a scaredy cat, he stepped up to chase off a thief, who tried to steal a package off the front porch.  Whitney Cahoon says her dog Zero is a ball-loving, good boy, who’s normally scared of everything, including dusters, plastic bags and cats.  But when porch pirates targeted the family’s home in Ogden, UT, Thursday, the pup went from Zero to hero.  A doorbell camera caught the moments when a man run up to the porch and grabbed a package. Seconds later, Zero bolted from the house towards the thief.  “I just kind of yelled, 'Get 'em, Zero. Get 'em!” Cahoon said. “He just went for it. It was awesome.”  The thief got in the waiting getaway car but threw the package, which contained a $4 dimmer switch from Ikea, back out onto the road.  Cahoon says porch pirates have been a common occurrence in the neighborhood.  "People have been trying to steal packages. They’ve caught them on camera but never here. We’re on a pretty busy street. I didn’t think that anyone would ever dare attempt that,” she said.  But now, thanks to Zero, their house is one that won’t be messed with.  "I’m hoping the word spreads from them not to mess with us,” Cahoon said.  Cahoon says she thinks it would have been funny if the man had gotten away with the package because the dimmer inside was pretty much worthless.<|im_end|>

# Mentally ill man who may pose 'catastrophic' risk made ward of court days before his release from prison

Mentally ill man who may pose 'catastrophic' risk made ward of court days before his release from prison  A convicted mentally ill man whose release from the Central Mental Hospital posed potentially "catastrophic" risk to himself and others was lawfully made a ward of court days before his sentence for serious violent offences was due to end, the Supreme Court has ruled. The man needed to be detained in the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) for his protection and that of the public and remains appropriately detained there under the High Court's wardship jurisdiction for reasons including he is of unsound mind, the five-judge court also held. Its unanimous judgment dismissing the man's appeal over his wardship and detention addresses important issues, with effects for other cases, concerning the intersection between the High Court's wardship jurisdiction and mental health laws. Lawyers for the man accepted his detention in the CMH was appropriate but the dispute was about the legal mechanism for that. They argued his rights would be better protected under mental health legislation. Giving the judgment, Mr Justice John MacMenamin said a lot of the problem arose because, while the man met criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act 2001, that provided he could not be admitted directly to the CMH and must first be taken for assessment to an "approved" centre. Psychiatrists told the High Court they had been informed by the HSE assessment had been "explored" but it appeared none of the approved centres were willing to take him for security reasons. Otherwise, the man, deemed very dangerous, could have been released within four days into the community with "potentially catastrophic" consequences for himself and others. There was no direct evidence before the High Court regarding the HSE's attempted compliance with the provisions of the 2001 Act, he said. He ruled there was sufficient material before the High Court to show it was not possible to operate the provisions of the 2001 Act and said Mr Justice Kelly's description of the relevant provisions as "unwieldy" was "an understatement". While it was possible some of those provisions were inspired by "overriding concerns"" about overcrowding in the CMH, the High Court was owed a "much fuller"" explanation about why "this crux" had risen but it had no time to seek that. The courts have inherent jurisdiction to be used only as a "backstop" when statutes do not govern a particular situation but, in this case, there was a statutory regime of wardship, he said. The "unavoidable logic" was the wardship and detention orders were "necessary and appropriate" and the High Court had no other legal option but to make them. The orders were necessary to vindicate the man's right to life and welfare and to protect the rights and welfare of others. Fair procedures were also observed and provision was made for the man to be legally represented, he held. While the man undoubtedly met the criteria for admission to the CMH as defined in the 2001 Act, the requirements for wardship orders, on the evidence before the High Court including he was of "unsound mind", were also satisfied. Under wardship, the safeguards and protections as regards procedural rights, review by the courts, consent and treatment could be no less than if he was admitted to the CMH under the Mental Health Act, the judge said. The fact wardship is a separate jurisdiction does not prevent the High Court adopting ""mirror" procedures to vindicate the constitutional and ECHR rights of wards of court and Mr Justice Kelly set out a list of those, he added. Without such protections, questions might arise concerning compliance with the Constitution and ECHR, he stressed. In cases of minors at risk in the last two decades, the exercise of the High Court's inherent jurisdiction became "the rule" and "a first, not a last, resort", he observed.<|im_end|>

# Look, No Hands: Watch These Amazing Videos Of A Designer Who Draws With Her Nose

Five years ago, as a new design intern who wanted to make a good impression, Michelle Vandy was putting in 10- to 15-hour days. Suddenly, she realized her arm hurt so much she could barely type. “I ended up working the whole summer without any breaks, and one day, my arms were really sore–it happened quickly,” Vandy says. “I was using my middle finger to zoom in and zoom out all the time in this 3-D design program. Basically, the whole summer I was using one finger. Then I’d come home and instantly sit in front of my home computer and start drawing, exhausting that same finger.” She tried using the mouse in her other hand, but that just caused another repetitive stress injury. After trying a never-ending list of solutions that didn’t work–holding a stylus in her mouth, drawing with her toes, using new eye-tracking tools, therapy for her arms–Vandy stumbled on something new: She realized that she could draw on a trackpad with her nose. “I was in bed one night and I held up the trackpad to my nose,” she says. “That’s when I realized that, hey, I have a lot of precision in my head, and I was surprised. The tip of your nose is kind of like a finger.” Vandy set up a trackpad on a tripod in front of her computer and has used it for design work ever since. In her current job as a designer for Omada Health, she’s building a library of graphic assets, including nose-drawn illustrations and UI and UX work. “I’ll still put in the same long hours, but I’ll just do it with my nose, and the nosepad, as I call it,” she says. Since the trackpad doesn’t work for typing, she usually uses voice recognition software as well. And her arms are no longer in pain. She hopes that her solution might inspire other designers, and has created a new website to share the story. “I want to tell other people that have the same problem and might think their jobs are in jeopardy that no, it doesn’t have to mean that. There are different ways of interacting with a computer. A mouse isn’t the only way.”<|im_end|>

# Chinese pork prices to rebound next quarter, world's top exporter predicts

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The Chinese pork market, currently flooded by domestic supply, is expected to recover in the second quarter, the head of the world’s top pork exporter said on Wednesday. China’s government this month encouraged pig farmers to quickly replenish their herds and said it would buy more pork for its reserves as it sought to curb price rises later in the year. “The fear of swine fever means that lots of pigs are being slaughtered in China at the moment, which limits the options on that market,” Danish Crown Chief Executive Jais Valeur said in an interview. “But I expect that to change around the second quarter, when we’ll see a shortage of domestic supply in China.” China’s agriculture ministry said this month it expects pork prices to rise in the second half of the year. China, the world’s biggest producer of pork, is battling the world’s fastest spreading epidemic of African swine fever. The disease has now reached 24 of its provinces and led to the culling of more than 900,000 pigs. The disease is deadly to hogs, but does not affect people.

# Big Events Drive Big Returns at this BlackRock Fund

Imagine being the CEO of a company with a 600-pound gorilla sitting in your boardroom that wants you to merge with another company. Are you going to say no?  The gorilla in this case would be BlackRock (ticker: BLK), which manages $6 trillion worldwide. “BlackRock is probably a top-five shareholder for nearly every company in the world,” says Mark McKenna, manager of BlackRock Event Driven Equity (BALPX), a $1.3 billion fund that seeks to profit off mergers, spinoffs, restructurings, management changes, and other key corporate “events.”  Working for the world’s largest money manager has clear advantages. “We invest in change that originates in the boardroom,” he says. “A top-five shareholder really can be a thought leader as it relates to the value creation of these situations.”  Merger arb and event-driven funds like McKenna’s might be particularly attractive to investors now, as markets have become more volatile. When one company seeks to acquire another, the target usually trades near the announced acquisition price until the deal closes or falls apart. Arbitrageurs like McKenna hope the deal closes, so they can capture the spread between the official offer and the target’s pre-acquisition price.  What’s nice about such a strategy is that the returns are largely uncorrelated with the market, as mergers can occur regardless of whether stocks are up or down. Thus, while the S&P 500 fell 13.5% in 2018’s last quarter, BlackRock Event Driven Equity was up 1.3%. In the past three years, the fund has gained 6.1% annualized, besting 95% of its peers in Morningstar’s Market Neutral category. Those returns came with volatility more on par with bonds than stocks—an annualized standard deviation of 3.6%, versus 11% for the S&P. Little wonder this fund has been so popular of late: It started 2018 with $200 million, McKenna says, and assets grew 600% over the course of the year.  McKenna stresses that this influx of new money won’t hamper his strategy, especially since his fund invests in more than just merger arbitrage deals. He employs a three-tiered strategy, investing in stocks of companies with “hard” catalysts or “soft” catalysts, or in their debt. Hard catalysts are traditional mergers or spinoffs with binary outcomes—either a deal happens or it doesn’t. Soft catalysts have more variable outcomes, and can include a management or product change. Debt investments are another low-risk source of return.  The fund has a highly experienced 12-member investment team. McKenna got his start as a mergers and acquisitions advisor for investment bank Solomon Smith Barney in 1999. “If you look at my entire investment team, we all started our Wall Street careers doing M&A advice directly for companies,” he says. “In the boardroom, I advised on over $100 billion in transactions directly myself.” Having an M&A insider’s perspective is an advantage.  Soft catalyst investments typically make up 30% to 35% of McKenna’s portfolio. “Let’s say the CEO of an energy company changes, and we think the new CEO can create value in a way the market underappreciates,” McKenna says. “We’ll do a number of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the risks. If this is an energy company, we will look to short or hedge out the energy component.” By being long the individual stock, but shorting or hedging against its market sector, the fund is exposed only to the risk of getting the event analysis right.  BlackRock Event Driven Equity  Note: Holdings as of December 31, 2018; all returns as of January 15, 2019; three-year returns are annualized.  Sources: Morningstar; BlackRock  Sometimes, an investment’s catalyst can shift, from soft to hard, or vice versa. Consider managed-care company Cigna (CI) and pharmacy-benefits outfit Express Scripts. Prior to their March 2018 merger announcement, McKenna was investing in health care on a soft-catalyst basis, as he saw it as ripe for consolidation. He likens contemporary health care to tech/media 20 years ago, when separate devices were needed to watch TV, use your phone, or surf the internet. “Today with your health-care providers, no one talks to each another,” he says. “My health-care [insurance] manager doesn’t talk to my hospital, which doesn’t talk to my pharmacy-benefits manager, which doesn’t talk to my diagnostics provider.”  McKenna says new technology and mergers will integrate the system. Once the deal was announced, Cigna became a hard catalyst investment; with a binary outcome, the merger took place in December 2018. McKenna still holds Cigna shares, but as a soft catalyst investment, based on the combined companies’ growth prospects.  Newsletter Sign-up  The Cigna deal also illustrates the advantages of having BlackRock’s clout. Corporate raider Carl Icahn opposed the merger, but BlackRock’s influence helped thwart him. Another example: When computer maker Dell Technologies (DELL) sought to go public by announcing in July that it would merge into VMware, in which it already had a stake, McKenna and his team didn’t think the transaction reflected the long-term value of the combination. After they and other investors engaged with Dell’s brass, the offer rose by about 20%.  While BlackRock units voted in a bloc in these deals, they didn’t have to; each money manager has a fiduciary duty to independently decide what’s best for his shareholders. But if a 600-pound gorilla’s on your team, why not let him do some arm-twisting?  Email: editors@barrons.com<|im_end|>

# Payment plans available, including for furloughed workers, in Bexar County

SAN ANTONIO - The tax assessor and collector in Bexar County announced Friday that payment plans are available for anyone struggling to afford their home property taxes. These same payment plans also can help qualifying furloughed federal employees.  “I fully understand the financial hardships created by the federal government shutdown and how it has left families struggling to make ends meet,” said Albert Uresti, Bexar County tax assessor-collector. “To assist these employees and others in similar situations with their 2018 residential property tax obligations, my office already has a 12-month payment plan available for those unable to pay their entire tax amount due by Jan. 31.” State law dictates that some penalties and interest will still apply, according to a news release from Uresti’s office. The penalty, in some cases, will be fixed at 6 percent, as opposed to 12 percent -- however, interest will still accumulate on the balance due at 1 percent per month until it’s paid in full. Payment arrangements can be made after Jan. 31. Anyone looking for more information is encouraged to visit the Tax Office website, or call 210-335-2251.

# Williams sends Central past Hutch

Harper Williams had one of those nights Tuesday against the Hutchinson Salthawks. The Salina Central senior tied a career-high with eight 3-pointers and scored 28 points as the Mustangs ended a frustrating two-game losing skid with a 50-35 victory on their home floor. The victory boosted the Mustangs to 11-4 overall and 4-4 in the AVCTL-I. They are currently locked in a logjam in the Class 5A west division standings where a team can go from fourth place to ninth, or vice versa, in a span of one or two games. "We kind of talked about that before the game," said assistant coach Ryan Modine, who coached in place of Doug Finch, who was serving a one-game suspension. "We're sitting there at 10-4 with a lot of other teams. The west is loaded, but you know, we've been ahead in the fourth quarter in all those games and there's no part of us who's thinking we're in trouble. "We play a tough schedule and like I told our team, wins are precious and you have to enjoy them. We have a tough one Friday at (Salina) South, but it was nice to see us get back and get in the groove." Williams, a 6-1 senior, was certainly in the groove, burying four consecutive 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to keep the visiting Salthawks at arm's length. Williams finished the game making 10 of 11 shots. The only shot he missed came at the start of the third quarter. He also made eight 3-pointers in the championship game of the 2018 Salina Invitational. "I kind of wanted to break (the record) a little bit, but I'm fine with eight 3s," Williams said, smiling. "Some nights, you're on; tonight was my night." Williams made 10 of Central's 18 field goals and 8 of its 10 treys. His 10 of 11 shooting offset a 9 of 27 performance (33 percent) by the rest of the Mustangs. The Mustangs needed Williams' hot hand throughout the game. Hutchinson (2-13, 0-8) cut Central's lead to five points midway through the third quarter and still were within six (37-31) with 4:36 left in the game. "We know when we play teams the second time on our schedule, it's going to be a lot harder than the first time," Williams said. "And tonight, it was just a real physical game and our defense got the job done. Down the stretch, my teammates needed me to step up and I delivered." Williams also led the team in rebounding with six boards. "The funny thing is, I knew he was playing a great game, but now that you say it, it's even better than I thought," Modine said. "I thought he was phenomenal. Defensively, he was good. He got some big boards and every time (Hutch) came scratching back, he'd come down and knock down a three." The Mustangs also got a spark off the bench from 5-9 senior Kameron DeMars, who forced several turnovers and scored five points in the fourth quarter, and 6-6 senior Caleb Glen, who had four points and four rebounds in the second quarter. Tate Webster, a 6-8 senior, had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Hutchinson.  Central girls 55, Hutch 43 Freshman guard Aubrie Kierscht popped in five 3-pointers and scored 25 points for the banged-up Mustangs, who held off the Salthawks for their ninth win of the season. Kierscht, a 5-5 guard, scored 11 of her game-high total in the first quarter as the Mustangs (9-6, 5-3) opened up a 15-5 lead. She finished the game hitting 6 of 12 shots from the field and 8 of 10 free throws. "My teammates just look for me at the 3-point line," Kierscht said. "I've got to give them credit because they find me when I'm open. I knew I was on, so I kept shooting. That's what the coach tells me to do, so I do it." Central led by 15 points (45-30) with 6:51 remaining in the game, but Hutchinson came charging back with a 13-5 run to close the margin to 49-43 with 1:58 left. But, Hampton Williams knocked down a pair of free throws and Kierscht made four in-a-row to ice the game. The game was reminiscent of the first time the two teams played this year when Hutchinson wiped out a16-point deficit in the fourth quarter. Central was playing short-handed with junior Peyton Griffin missing the game with a knee injury. Senior forward Selah Merkle was back for the first time in two weeks after suffering a concussion, but was not yet at 100 percent. Junior guard Kadyn Cobb also played much of the game with an injured hand. "We need to get ourselves healthy, but I thought we showed a lot of grit tonight, to battle against a solid group," Central coach Chris Fear said. "We've been playing through some adversity here." Kierscht made 5 of 8 three-pointers to boost the Mustang offense. She was joined in double figures by Williams, a fellow freshman, who finished with 12 points and team-high nine rebounds. Gabbie Posch scored 14 points for Hutchinson (5-10, 2-6).<|im_end|>

# Amcu calls for reopening of Lily mine | IOL Business Report

JOHANNESBURG - The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) on Wednesday called for the immediate reopening of the ill-fated Lily Mine in Barberton, Mpumalanga, so that the bodies of three workers can be recovered.  Tuesday marked the third anniversary of an accident at Lily Mine in Mpumalanga which trapped and killed three workers.  Pretty Nkambule, Solomon Nyirenda and Yvonne Mnisi were trapped underground when the lamp-room in which they were working was swallowed by earth after a crown pillar collapsed and a container they were working in fell into a sinkhole. Their bodies remain underground.  Operations at the mine ground to halt in February 2016 after the accident, and the mine was placed under business rescue with about 1,000 workers losing their jobs.  Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa said everything must be done to bring dignity to the memories of these fallen workers.  "Comrades Pretty, Solomon and Yvonne are still buried in there and there is nothing dignified about this situation. We will never stop making noise about this tragic Lily Mine disaster. Those are our people down there and we want them out," Mathunjwa said.  "When Amcu called on the former president Jacob Zuma to declare Lily Mine a disaster zone we were met with useless resistance. Vantage Goldfields cited that recovering our comrades would be an expensive undertaking -- an example of monopoly capital that places profits above the lives of our people. Amcu demands rightful dignity for the buried comrades, their families and the community of this mine."  Siyakhula Sonke Empowerment Corporation (SSC), the new owners of Lily Mine, said on Tuesday that it would soon resume operations after the process of recruiting new employees started early this year.  The company which is planning on taking over the Lily Mine from Vantage Goldfields declared through its chief executive, Fred Arendse, that it is committed to re-opening the mine and creating jobs to restore the livelihoods of community members.  "This mine must be re-opened so the people of this community may have their jobs back and their livelihoods restored. This is one of the ways we want to honour the lives of Pretty, Solomon and Yvonne," Arendse said.  He further committed to commence the recruitment process for employees as early as March 27.  Arendse also assured all members that his company is financially stable to take over the mine and would ensure that stringent safety measures are implemented to ensure the safety of workers once the mine is re-opened.  In December, the department of mineral resources approved the transfer of ownership of Lily and Barbrook mine from Australian owned Vantage Goldfields to SCC's subsidiary, Flaming Silver Trading, in terms of Section 11 of the Mineral and Petroleum Development Act.  SCC then received R190 million from the Industrial Development Corporation to restart the mine.  - African News Agency (ANA)<|im_end|>

# Randy in the Rings: Back-and-forth battles mark elementary championships

The city has witnessed many an outstanding youth curling rivalry over the course of time. While many pre-date my involvement in covering the winter pastime, I can vividly recall the early days of the Tracy Horgan-Amanda Gates high school battles, giving way to countless other variations, including, most recently, the titanic tug-of-war between Team Brunton and Team Croisier for NOCA junior women’s supremacy. No reason to act terribly surprised, then, as the Churchill Cougars and St. Pierre Pantheres were back in familiar territory at the very end of the Elementary Curling Bonspiel last weekend at Curl Sudbury. The tables were turned in a rematch of the 2018 championship affair. “Last year, we lost by a lot,” noted Churchill skip Brendan Rajala. “This year, we were down by four in the first end. But then we took two, stole two, stole two again, so we were up 6-4. Then we made a key shot to steal another one, a hit and roll. They would have gotten four. “We just tried to keep them down in the last end. They scored two, but we won 7-6.” There was no lack of gold medal encounter experience on hand for this contest as St. Pierre returned virtually an identical roster to one year ago (Mia Toner-skip; Jesse Crozier-vice; Emilie Glabb-second; Justine Toner-lead), while Churchill graduated just one regular, boasting a 2019 lineup of Brendan Rajala, Nathan Radey, Emma Salvati and Caitlin Slavinski. The younger brother of Team Croiser lead Lauren (Rajala), the competitive skip of the Cougars noted a somewhat different strategy as he returned for another shot at this title this winter. “Last year, I was putting up more guards than usual,” said (Brendan) Rajala. “But then I realized that some of the curlers can’t do takeouts, so I threw a clean game and put a lot of shots in the house, except for the last couple of games, where I had to put up guards.” In fact, strategy would come into play with a couple of different facets of the Churchill game for coach Sandy MacEwan, including positional movement based on the throwing tendencies of a few team members. “I played vice and lead,” noted 11-year-old Grade 6 student Nathan Radey. “At the start, they asked me what position I wanted to play and I just chose lead. But then I got switched to vice halfway through the year. I think it was just because I was throwing heavier for my guards than what I was supposed to. The girls are really good at setting up guards for our skip. They’re not whipping it past the lines.” Now in his third year of curling, Radey has noted an increased comfort level with his game, even if not quite at the level of the club curlers who populate some of the rosters at the event. “I’ve been getting better, because my team has given me tips, and I have more experience,” he said “I think just coming out of the hack is where I have improved the most.” “I just try and go as close as I can to the broom. My weight is not usually the greatest, so I am learning to get my weight right. I always have to shoot it either a bit lighter or a bit heavier.” Semifinal action would see St. Pierre defeat Marymount A, while Churchill stopped Nesbitt Public. The annual bonspiel attracted a total of 16 teams, including entries from St. Augustin, Algonquin, St. Charles, Macdonald-Cartier, Confederation, Hanmer and Notre Dame de la Merci. St Pierre did walk away with one additional consolation prize, emerging as champions of the skills competition (each players throws two draws to the button). From the ultra young to the not so young as the NOCA senior championships continue through to Sunday at the Port Arthur Curling Club in Thunder Bay. With six draws in the books, the top end of the men’s eight team-field is engaged in quite the horse race. A huge 8-2 win over former world champion Al Hackner (Fort William CC) Friday morning had seemingly put the Curl Sudbury rink of Robbie Gordon (skip), Ron Henderson (vice), Dion Dumontelle (second) and Doug Hong (lead) in very good shape to secure no worse than a berth in the tiebreakers. Unfortunately, a 6-5 extra-end loss to Floyd Hopson of the McIntyre/Timmins later the same day has now set up a winner take all Saturday morning battle with Tim Warkentin of Keewatin in the seventh and final draw. Currently, the Hackner quartet are showing the way in the standings with a record of 5-1, with both Gordon and Warkentin at 4-2. Hackner must face Hopson in Draw 7, but even a loss there would leave him no worse than tied for first place with the winner of the Gordon/Warkentin tilt. Earlier action saw Team Gordon blank Roger Sauve of Coniston (7-0), before being saddled with a loss, courtesy of Kent Maarup of the host club (5-4). No worries for the quartet that has represented the North on several occasions in the past decade, as Gordon and company bounced back with victories over Chris Gordon of Copper Cliff (11-2), Patrick Chartier of the Idylwylde (8-2) and Hackner (as noted above). Once that event is in the books, all eyes will shift to Prince Albert, Sask., site of the 2019 New Holland Canadian Junior Curling Championships. The Northern Ontario men’s team of Tanner Horgan, Max Cull, Jacob Horgan and Maxime Blais will open with games against Nova Scotia on Saturday, and P.E.I and New Brunswick the next day, while the women’s foursome of Kira Brunton, Megan Smith, Sara Guy and Kate Sherry face Alberta on Day 1, and Saskatchewan (host) and Nunavut on Sunday. Some big curling news locally, albeit with much still to be decided, as some structural issues with the roof at the Coniston Curling Club have forced the group to temporarily close down the facility. With an emergency membership meeting set for Saturday and an engineer’s report with possible options due early next week, the CCC executive is looking to provide more clarity to the course of action, moving forward, by the time our next column appears on Jan. 26. Randy in the Rings runs weekly during the curling season.<|im_end|>

# UT Vols: Will Dyersburg late-bloomer Chris Russell pick Tennessee, Arkansas, another SEC school?

With a college decision looming, here's a look at Dyersburg's Christopher Russell before he makes his next step. Kenneth Cummings, Jackson Sun DYERSBURG — Chris Russell was a late bloomer among college football recruiters. However, the Dyersburg senior could find himself in the SEC after a standout senior season that grabbed colleges attention. Russell, a former Memphis commitment, enters the final few days before the Feb. 6 signing day with options. Russell committed to the Tigers in June and was then offered by Arkansas. After he decommitted from Memphis in November, Russell quickly was offered by Auburn, Tennessee and Texas A&M within a 12-day span. “He’s the type of player you want to coach because he’s very humble, has a blue-collar attitude, comes in ready to work and takes it to the field on Friday night,” Dyersburg coach Bart Stowe said. “Not only does he work great here in the offseason in the weight room, practice fields, but he takes it to the field every Friday night. He’s been a really good leader for this team.” Russell said he wants to go to a football program where it has had previous success and he may be able to get them back to that level. How Chris Russell became an SEC prospect Russell is a 6-foot-1, 228-pound inside linebacker. He's the No. 27 prospect in the state according to the 247Sports Composite. Russell finished with 112 tackles on defense and had 870 total yards with 18 touchdowns on offense. The Trojans reached the Class 4A state quarterfinals before finishing the season 12-1. It was their most wins since 2006. Russell was a three-year starter at Dyersburg, playing along side his stepbrother Daviaon Henderson on defense since the third grade. The two dreamed of playing together in college. Then Henderson's final high school season ended prematurely due to a torn ACL. “We both had the same mentality when we were on the field together,” Russell said. “We wanted to win and we both knew what it took to win. You sometimes worry when you’re playing alongside someone you haven’t been playing with for awhile, but playing with him I never had to worry.” Russell remained supportive of Henderson after the injury. “He would just tell me to keep my head up and that things were going to get better,” Henderson said. “He told me that even though that had happened, that I still had made an imprint on him and I was still going to be helping out.” Russell and Henderson are the last of five boys. Their three older siblings also played football with two going to Virginia Military Institute. While Russell doesn't have the offers that his brother has, He has been invited to walk on at Arkansas and Tennessee. A chance to play with his brother would be a dream come true for Russell. “Wherever I go, my family is going to be there,” Russell said. “They’re football-minded. We had three brothers in front of us so I know that they’ll go see us wherever we end up playing.” Russell is set to visit Tennessee this weekend.

# 7 Lessons In Creativity From The Brilliant Code Breaker of “The Imitation Game”

Building on his Sherlock Holmes smartest-guy-in-the-room persona, Benedict Cumberbatch portrays genius Alan Turing in The Imitation Game, opening November 28. Based on an astonishing true story, the period drama chronicles how the secretly gay British mathematician and his team of well-dressed geeks saved an estimated 14 million lives during World War II by building a proto-computer that cracked the Nazis’ supposedly unbreakable “Enigma” encryption code. Turing overcame childhood trauma, a prickly disposition and office politics to outsmart Hitler in an achievement deemed by Winston Churchill as the single most important contribution to winning World War II. Norwegian director Morten Tyldum, hired on the strength of his hit European thriller Headhunters (based on a book by Jo Nesbo) says “Turing was uncompromisingly honest. As soon as he didn’t think you were interesting or smart, he’d just turn around and walk away even if you were in the middle of a sentence.” Tyldum talks to Co.Create about the creative takeaways embodied by Turing’s transformation from awkward loner to shrewd team leader. In 1939 Turing survives a tense job interview and lands work at the government’s secret code-breaking operation at Bletchley Park in the south of England. Turing gets hired not because he’s likable but because his resume includes a scholarly paper establishing him as England’s reigning expert on artificial intelligence. Tyldum says, “This is a man who was 23 years old when he theorized the idea of creating a programmable machine and in that way, Turing foresaw computers and artificial intelligence. These were revolutionary ideas at that time.” Midway through The Imitation Game Turing hires a woman for his all-male team simply because 25-year-old Cambridge University graduate Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) solved a test crossword puzzle faster than all her rivals. “The prejudice at the time was extraordinary because sexism was institutionalized and built into the law,” Tyldum says. “One important thing the movie shows is that Turing embraced people who were seen as being outsiders, who were different kind of thinkers.” Clarke becomes a key member of the “Hut 8” operation. “Turing looked past prejudice, which then allows you to do new and brilliant and great things. You do not move forward by following convention. You celebrate those who are different, who are not burdened by ‘normality.'” Turing needs 100,000 pounds to build the thinking machine that would perform the work of hundreds of men in a matter of hours. When his boss, Naval Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) denies the request, Turing writes a letter directly to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and quickly receives the funding along with a job promotion. “Turing was fearless,” Tyldum says. “He’s extremely direct, which can be seen as socially awkward, and that becomes both his big obstacle but also in many ways his strength.” A loner by temperament, Turing isolates himself to obsess over the bronze, copper, and wire “Bombe” contraption he’s built to beat Enigma. Helen upbraids him for leaving his collaborators in the dark, saying: “I’m a woman so I can’t afford to behave like an ass but neither can you. You need help and the only way you’re going to get it is to make them like you.” The next day Turing passes out apples to his co-workers and clumsily tells a joke. The gesture is appreciated and shortly thereafter, Turing’s most talented colleague Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) makes a critical improvement to Bombe electro-mechanics. “Alan was very much a man who kept to himself and sort of pushed away other people,” Tyldum says. “Joan makes him understand that he has to bring other people into his world in order to solve EnigmaI. The Imitation Game shows how important it is to have this uncompromising drive, but you also need to work together with other people.” When Turing and his team finally break the code, they face a brutal dilemma: if the Allies immediately act on intercepted messages to stop German attacks, the Nazis will realize their code has been broken and change tactics accordingly. In the film, Turin decides “Our job isn’t to break Enigma. Our job is to win the war.” For the next four years, he insists that Britain conceal the sources of its intelligence. Tyldum observes, “Sometimes you can’t afford to do what is human, you have to do what is logical. Turing had this very logical mind. He wasn’t thinking about emotions in the same way as most people. MI6 created fake double agents, leaked rumors to Nazis about German officers who partied too much in Paris and did all kinds of things to camouflage the fact that Turing had actually broken Enigma.” Turing’s wartime service remained a state secret for 50 years but his personal life became public knowledge when he got arrested in 1951 for consorting with a gay man. Secrecy defined Turin’s legacy, Tyldum says. “In his paper ‘The Imitation Game’ Alan wrote that you’re only human to the extent that you can convince other people that you are, that you are what other people think you are. If a machine can convince you it’s a human, then it’s a human. This is coming from a closeted gay man who is imitating a straight man, who is hiding who he is his whole life. You can see how these revolutionary ideas that essentially created computer science came from all closeted gay man who had to hold everything inside at a time when homosexuality was illegal.” Flashbacks in The Imitation Game shed light on Turing’s difficult childhood. “Alan was an awkward boy who had a stammer so we wanted to show what it was like for him to be this outsider at school,” Tyldum says. “When bullies put Alan in a box and buried him in the ground, he’s saved by Christopher Morcom (Jack Bannon) who’s also extremely smart and shares this interest in cryptology.” Tragedy ensues. “Alan had very deep feelings for Christopher and it’s almost like his life’s work became about trying to bring him back. Turing was obsessed with artificial life, artificial intelligence, questions about ‘Is there a soul?’ ‘Is there a mind?’ ‘Can we re-create consciousness?’ You could argue that all of that comes out of Turing’s sense of loss and unfulfilled love.”<|im_end|>

# L.A. County debates how to limit use of pepper spray in juvenile halls, camps

LOS ANGELES – Concerned about the use of pepper spray in Los Angeles County juvenile halls and camps, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Tuesday proposed more training, more cameras and more mental health resources, while juvenile justice advocates called for a outright ban. A report by the Office of Inspector General found that some probation staffers use oleoresin capsicum spray, more commonly known as pepper spray, as a threat or first line of defense, even though department policy dictates its use as a last resort when youth are physically aggressive. The threat of use sometimes gets young people to comply with staff orders, but at other times, threats seemed to unnecessarily escalate situations, based on video reviewed by the OIG. The OIG also reported that staff sometimes failed to decontaminate kids after using the chemical spray, which when sprayed in the eyes brings tears, pain and even temporary blindness. The report mentioned one child with a mental health condition who was sprayed in the groin and buttocks when he was found trying to hurt himself. After being sprayed, he was left in a room without running water for about 20 minutes before staff returned to help him. Policy prohibits using the spray on youth taking psychotropic medication or who have asthma or are pregnant. Public Defender Ricardo Garcia said the use of pepper spray is excessive, out-of-policy and amounts to child abuse. “I believe the only solution in this situation is to ban the use of pepper spray in our facilities,” Garcia told the board. The December request for an OIG review was prompted by media reports, including a nine-month investigation by NBC4 finding the use of pepper spray had more than doubled from 2015-17. The department’s own numbers show the use of pepper spray was up roughly 200 percent at Los Padrinos and Barry J. Nidorf juvenile halls and more than 330 percent at Central Juvenile Hall. However, probation officials reported that usage was down 20 percent in 2018 as compared with 2017 and said the majority of pepper spray use was in line with policy. Chief Deputy Probation Officer Sheila Mitchell, who oversees juvenile probation, said only 36 percent of staffers used OC spray and of those, nearly half were employees who had worked for the department for less than two years and another 30 percent had more than 10 years on duty. That points to the need for more training of new staffers around de-escalating potentially violent situations, as well as the need to change embedded cultural attitudes. Mitchell ran Santa Clara’s Probation Department before coming to Los Angeles. “When I was chief of Santa Clara County, we never used it,” Mitchell told the board, though she stressed the need for additional training rather than proposing a pepper spray ban. Its use is allowed in all three Los Angeles County juvenile halls and two juvenile camps, Camp Ellison Onizuka and Camp Ronald McNair, although 35 states prohibit its use on juveniles, as do San Francisco, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz and Marin counties, according to the OIG report. Probation Chief Terri McDonald, speaking outside the meeting room, told City News Service that Santa Clara County had the advantage of updated juvenile facilities. Los Angeles County’s juvenile halls are “very prison-environment-like and that may actually breed that custodial setting,” McDonald said. “So if you look at what the county’s done at Campus Kilpatrick — small group model, rehabilitative, campus-like feel — that creates a different culture, a different environment than a detention facility like we’re running in most of our juvenile halls.” The department is continuing to close juvenile facilities as it focuses on diversion programs, which has increased the concentration of “high needs, high risk” children among the population of roughly 900 in the halls and seven camps. Supervisor Kathryn Barger said that mirrored issues in the county’s jail system. “All roads lead to mental health, whether it be in the jails or our juvenile halls,” she said. Barger and Supervisor Janice Hahn also emphasized the safety concerns of front-line probation employees. “It’s almost like they feel like they’re being set up for failure,” Barger said, urging more training. Hahn said she was troubled “to hear that our workers … are feeling unsafe. The morale is low, (they are) not feeling supported.” Department numbers show youth-on-youth assaults were up 66 percent and youth-on-staff assaults were up 58 percent from 2016-17, though Mitchell said those numbers have since dropped. Probation officers told the OIG they lacked effective policies and training to de-escalate tense situations without using OC spray. Some also called for more supervisory staff. Though many staffers manage to manage tense situations without ever using pepper spray, Assistant Inspector General Cathleen Beltz told the board, “Most express a firm belief that it is absolutely necessary to their personal safety.” The OIG recommended more cameras, more reporting and more staff training. The department installed 460 cameras at Central Juvenile Hall, where the highest number of assaults have occurred, and the department has requested another $30 million-plus for additional cameras at other facilities. Beltz also suggested that the board consider restricting or eliminating the use of OC spray, calling it “physically or emotionally harmful to youth.” Juvenile justice advocates agreed. “What you’re telling that kid when you’re pepper spraying him is ‘you belong in here,'” said Kent Mendoza, policy coordinator for the Anti- Recidivism Coalition. “You’re preparing him for prison.” However, Beltz also warned the board that “any changes (related to a ban) should absolutely be incremental.” Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, who had called for the OIG review, proposed a special hearing on the issue by the CEO’s Probation Reform and Implementation Team and recommended that the Probation Department develop an implementation plan for the OIG’s recommendations. He also asked the OIG to update data on pepper spray use and report back in 30 days. “The need for reform, investigation and oversight has never been as vital as it is now,” Ridley-Thomas said. –<|im_end|>

# A Photographic Celebration Of The Sikh Beard And Turban

In contemporary hipsterdom and among Hollywood’s leading men, the beard is a fashion statement. But in the Sikh religion, a resplendent beard is a symbol of spiritual deference and discipline. London-based photographer duo Amit and Naroop, who were raised on a mixture of Western and traditional Sikh values, were intrigued by how trendy beards had become among the hip secular set. It inspired them to do a photography project documenting contemporary Sikh men; they would focus on the symbolism of those men’s beards and turbans. “We wanted men who wore their turban in their own style and with beards that had character,” Naroop tells Co.Design. Currently being funded on Kickstarter, The Singh Project series documents 35 British Sikh men–a diverse and colorful bunch, including temple volunteers, fashion stylists, boxers, doctors, magicians, architects, watchmakers, and students. “We selected young British Sikh men whose style was a fusion of East and West, as well as older Sikh men who kept their look more traditional,” Naroop says. Speaking to their subjects, the photographers were struck by the pride they took in their beards and turbans. Specifically, Sikhs’ beards symbolize the belief that God made humans in perfection, and that they shouldn’t alter his choice in facial hair. Then there are the turbans, many in bright colors and prints, worn to protect the uncut hair and to guard the spiritual opening Sikhs believe resides at the top of the head. Some of their subjects pose with a Kirpan, a dagger that symbolizes a Sikh’s duty to come to the defense of those in peril. Baptized (and practicing) Sikhs wear these daggers on their body at all times. “Some of the younger Sikh men told us how their younger years were spent drinking, smoking, and getting into trouble,” Naroop says. “But when they embraced Sikhism, grew their hair, and wore a turban, they no longer needed their previous false physical pleasures as Sikhism gave them everything they needed on a deeper spiritual level.” A few of the older Sikh men told stories of having to cut their hair when they first came to England–just to be accepted by a xenophobic culture and to get jobs to feed their families. The photographer duo found Sikhism’s compatibility with modern science attractive. As they were growing up, “religion was never forced on us,” Naroop says. “We find following its teachings in the modern world feels natural and not prohibitive,” he says, and emphasizes, “Singh is a project close to our heart. It represents our identity as British born photographers and our Punjabi, Sikh roots.” Back the project here.<|im_end|>

# This Crazy Suit Will Age You 40 Years In 5 Minutes

For a little while on a recent weekday afternoon, my body aged about 40 years. The arthritis in my fingers made it nearly impossible to make a fist, let alone pick up a pen, without grimacing in pain. I could only walk up the stairs by shuffling sideways. The din of the crowd was so loud that I could barely hear; as I result, I shouted my responses in casual conversation. And the macular degeneration in my eyes clouded my vision. I was wearing pieces of the R70 aging suit, a full body suit and helmet commissioned by Genworth, a company that provides life- and long-term care insurance. The suit, set to debut to the public at the upcoming Social Innovation Summit in the San Francisco Bay Area, provides a preview of what it’s like to grow old by simulating normal aging along with common conditions like arthritis and vision loss. The suit was designed through a collaboration between Genworth, the makeup and creature effects studios Spectral Motion, and Edward Schneider, a professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California. First, Genworth hired a costume designer to sketch out a design. Then Schneider brought the design–which originally resembled something straight out of Tron–to Spectral Motion, so they could discuss what aspects of aging would be possible to replicate in a suit. The assignment was a novel one for the studio, which usually creates flexible designs for people who need to move around a lot, like dancers and stuntmen. “Our area of focus has always been to try to make suits to help people move as much as possible. That actually puts us in the position of knowing quite accurately what does impede movement,” explains Spectral Motion president and creative director Mike Elizalde. To mimic the muscle loss that occurs with aging, this meant inserting the very heavy metal tungsten into the suit’s gloves and boots. Stiffness in the suit around the knees, elbows, and knuckles mimics arthritis by making it hard to bend, while an internal harness moves the wearer’s entire posture forward, making it impossible to truly stand upright. In the helmet, an audio system blasts the sounds of a large crowd, so wearers can experience what it’s like to not be able to hear people talking directly in front of them. A series of mechanically operated lenses (much like what you’d find at an opthamologist’s office) mimic different eye diseases, including cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. There are actually two versions of the suit–one designed for men, and one for women. Each was modeled on the body cast of a famous actor, though Spectral Motion wouldn’t say who. My experience with the R70 seemed at times to be like an extreme version of aging; I could certainly imagine my eyes and hearing abilities deteriorating in the way that the suit suggested, but it was nearly impossible to use any fine motor skills while wearing the clunky gloves. Schneider says that in reality, the suit replicates a fairly normal aging experience. (The suit isn’t meant to mimic a specific age, just what it’s like to be old). “They’ve really done a spectacular job replicating the problems I have and my peers have,” he says. The suit certainly does a better job than the makeshift props (glasses, gloves, earplugs) that he uses in his Introduction to Gerontology class to help students understand aging. Genworth is planning to take the R70 on a countrywide tour so that the public can experience it (and presumably be persuaded to buy insurance); the company is also lending the suit to its customer service representatives so they can understand what their customers go through.<|im_end|>

# Former Gloucester player returns to Hartpury on loan from Bristol

Mat Protheroe has returned to Hartpury as one of five players to join the club on loan from Bristol.  The full-back has made one Premiership appearance this season after returning from a serious knee injury that kept him out for a long period.  He will now be able to get some game time at Hartpury, where he starred in two AASE Championship triumphs with Hartpury before joining Gloucester, en-route to Ashton Gate.  Protheroe’s most recent Hartpury performances were in the National One campaign of 2016-17 when he regularly combined with the likes of Harry Randall, Jake Polledri, Ben Vellacott and Lithuanian express Jonas Mikalcius to terrorise opposition defences.  The former England Under-18 and Under-20 international signed his first professional contract at Gloucester and made four appearances in the 2016-17 season before joining Bristol.  Joining Protheroe on loan at Hartpury will be Ehize Ehizode, who has been performing well for the club in recent weeks, as well as Sam Graham and Charlie Powell, who both had some limited involvement earlier in the season.  Powell’s single appearance was in the 23-17 win over this Saturday’s opponents, Coventry, back in September.  The fifth member of the quintet – and the only one with no prior Hartpury involvement – is prop Jake Armstrong, signed by Bristol from the Jersey Reds prior to the current season, and previously of both Doncaster Knights and Wharfedale.  Hartpury director of rugby John Barnes, said: “We would like to thank Bristol Bears and Pat Lam for the loan of these players.”  “Clearly, we are having some serious issues with injury this season and we are hoping that the addition of these top-quality young players will be of great help to us in the weeks to come.”  “For our supporters, of course, it will be exciting to see an alumni, Mat Protheroe, back in a Hartpury shirt at some point in the next few weeks.”  Bristol director of rugby Pat Lam added: “Over the next block of crucial fixtures, it’s important we ensure that every player in the squad get game-time and have an opportunity to get minutes under their belts.”  Hartpury will hope that the new arrivals can help keep them in the Championship. They are currently six points adrift at the bottom of the table with nine games left.<|im_end|>

# Optimistic about Indian market despite changes in new FDI policy: Walmart - Indiaretailing.com

US retail major Walmart, which invested $16 billion in Flipkart, Wednesday said it is committed to the Indian market and is optimistic despite recent changes in the FDI policy for e-commerce firms in the country, according to a PTI report.  The Bentonville-based retailing major’s statement came after a recent report by global consultancy firm Morgan Stanley, which had hinted that Walmart may quit Flipkart as the new foreign direct investment (FDI) policy came into effect, which would lower its profitability in the long run. Morgan Stanley, in a report titled ‘Assessing Flipkart Risk to Walmart EPS’ dated February 4, claimed that “an exit is likely, not completely out of the question, with the Indian e-commerce market becoming more complicated.” “Walmart’s and Flipkart’s commitment to India is deep and long term. Despite the recent changes in regulations, we remain optimistic about the country,” said Dirk Van den Berghe, Executive Vice President and Regional CEO Walmart Asia and Canada.  He further added, “We will continue to focus on serving customers, creating sustained economic growth and bringing sustainable benefits to the country, including employment generation, supporting small businesses and farmers, and growing Indian exports to Walmart’s global markets.” Tightening norms for e-commerce firms having foreign investment, the government, from February 1, barred online marketplaces like Flipkart and Amazon from selling products of companies where they hold stakes and banned exclusive marketing arrangements that could influence product price. The revised policy on FDI in online retail, issued by the commerce and industry ministry, also said that these firms have to offer equal services or facilities to all its vendors without discrimination. Last year on August 18, Walmart had completed acquisition of 77 per cent stake in Flipkart for about $16 billion (Rs 1.05 lakh crore), a deal which gave the US retailer access to the Indian e-commerce market.<|im_end|>

# Former Army Chief Wants To Run For Karabakh President

Samvel Babayan, Nagorno-Karabakh’s former military leader, has expressed his desire to run in a presidential election that will be held in the Armenian-populated territory next year.  In an interview with RFE/RL’s Armenian service, Babayan said he will start collecting next month signatures of local residents in a bid to circumvent a legal provision that bars him from running for Karabakh president.  “I realize that I still have a role to play there,” he said. “I’m not finished and will try to do everything to be of use [to Karabakh.]”  Babayan, 53, was the commander of Karabakh’s Armenian-backed army during and after the 1991-1994 war with Azerbaijan. He was widely regarded as the unrecognized republic’s most powerful man at that time.  Babayan was arrested in 2000 and subsequently sentenced to 14 years in prison for allegedly masterminding a botched attempt on the life of the then Karabakh president, Arkady Ghukasian. He was set free in 2004.  Babayan lived in Russia for five years before returning to Armenia in 2016. He was again arrested in Yerevan in March 2017 on charges of illegal arms acquisition and money laundering which he strongly denied.  The arrest came about two weeks before Armenian parliamentary elections. Babayan unofficially coordinated the election campaign of an opposition alliance challenging then Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian.  A Yerevan court sentenced the once powerful general to six years in prison in November 2017. Armenia’s Court of Cassation overturned the verdict in June 2018, ordering Babayan’s release from prison. The decision came more than a month after Sarkisian was overthrown in a popular uprising led by Nikol Pashinian, the current Armenian prime minister.  Around the same time Bako Sahakian, Karabakh’s president, announced that he will not seek reelection when his current term in office ends in 2020. Sahakian has been in power since 2007.  Under Karabakh law, only those individuals who have resided in Karabakh for the past 10 years can participate in the 2020 presidential election. Babayan does not meet that requirement.  Citing another legal provision, the former strongman said that he can overcome that hurdle if his presidential candidacy is backed by thousands of Karabakh Armenians. “We will start the signature collection in March and then see if the authorities comply with or ignore what the constitution stipulates,” he said.  Asked whether he thinks the current Karabakh leadership will let him enter the presidential race, Babayan said: “At my penultimate meeting with Bako Sahakian, I said: ‘Let’s draw a line and forget everything: all the conflicts and problems.’ It seemed to me that they must realize that Armenia and Karabakh are now in such a difficult situation that it makes no sense to keep having grudges, settling scores or feuding with one or another person.”<|im_end|>

# Young Voices: Social media is a fake reality

11:47AM, Thursday 07 February 2019  Maleeka is 12 years old and lives in Holyport. She was born with leber's retinal amaurosis, which is an eye condition that severely impaired both eyes.  She is currently attending Holyport College and runs a blog – Meeks Speaks VIP – spreading awareness on physical challenges and empowering young people to accept who they are and to embrace their individuality. meeksspeaks.com    The main problem for teens, in era of information age and social media, is the feeling of being judged and becoming someone that society demands.  The media does not help, especially the fashion, beauty and music industry and those magazines that target young  people.  Luckily as a VIP (visually impaired person) as I can’t see images and adverts, I have the space to find out who I am, what I love about myself and my unique personality and not pretend to be someone I am not to be accepted by others.  Pretending to be someone you are not to impress others can cause many health issues like depression, anxiety, bulimia and anorexia. It can also make teens feel suicidal with the pressure to keep up with society expectations that are simply unrealistic.  Also people who do not ‘act cool’ or follow the latest trends may be neglected, which is wrong because they are not appreciated and don’t get a chance to share their unique qualities. By ‘acting cool’, I mean dressing a certain way or using abusive language, even bullying and disrespecting others, to seem strong or being part of a collective force against a vulnerable person.  Some people also don’t stand up for injustice against another as it is seen as ‘not cool’ by their peers.  To me being cool is having a kind heart, not about what you look like, and treating people with respect.  Being cool is being open to different people, their cultures and accepting for who they are.  Teens are obsessed with social media, the likes, shares and comments on their posts, but if you look deeper they really only want one true person who will accept them for who they really are and not pretend to be.  Social media is a fake reality.  Anyone can pretend to be anything they wish but in day-to-day life they may be really lonely and sad and suffer from many health problems.  We all just want to have one special person or a small group of people who love you and are loyal to you.  How to help yourself?  Calm down, try to get away from the noise and have a think. Understand the nature of social media and bring to your awareness that is not your real world.  Find out what you are passionate about, what makes you smile, brings joy into your life. Find your unique way of expressing yourself whether through art, sport, music, voice, writing and comedy. Put your focus on developing your area of interest and be the best you can be in your chosen passion.  You will attract the people who will admire you for who you are and be happy in the process of genuine meaningful friendships and interactions with others.  Don’t take personally what people say or opinions about you. It is more important to be unique and find a special group of friends than to have many and still feel lonely.  It’s not cool to be part of a crowd but being unique is cool.  Don’t feel pressured to follow the ever-changing trends that ruin personalities and confuse identities.  As a VIP I love makeup and fashion. It is great to look good and look after yourself but don’t make this your purpose.  Luckily as a VIP I can’t see what people are wearing or looking like so I don’t judge them for this. It is my heart’s eye that ‘sees’. I am impressed with people who have good hearts and I like to surround myself with people who bring value into my life and I can do the same for them.  Helping people find their uniqueness is my big passion behind my blog. To empower young people not to copy others but to be you. There is only one of you just as our fingerprints are all different, we as people are all different too and should be happy to embrace this fact.  This way society can grow as you bring unique ideas and creativity to the table rather than the same old thoughts being regurgitated over and over again.  To expect a change, be the change and encourage others to do this too.    If you’re a frustrated millennial or post-millennial with something to say, we want to hear from you. As part of our aim to give a voice to all sections of the community we serve, the Advertiser is looking to provide a platform for younger people living in the area we cover.

# DC Man Sentenced To Serve 5 Years For Human Trafficking Of Minor-Conspiracy

FREDERICK, Md. (WJZ) — Luis Privado, 24, was sentenced to 25 years in the Division of Correction, with all but five years suspended, effectively serving five years in prison.  After his sentence is complete, he will be placed on five years of supervised probation, with the conditions of no contact with the victim, no contact with the co-defendant and no unsupervised contact with individuals under the age of 18.  He must also register as a tier II sex offender.  Privado entered a guilty plea on July 31, 2018 to human trafficking of a minor-conspiracy. His bond was revoked at that time.  Frederick police officers responded to the McDonald’s on Jefferson Street on December 30, 2017, for a reported abduction.  Officers made contact with the co-defendant, Abiathar Vance, and the 16-year-old victim who had been reported missing for the previous two months.  
Luis Privado and Abiathar Vance: Courtesy Frederick State’s Attorney Office The victim said she had met Privado and co-defendant Vance in August 2017 at Union Station.

# UAE News: UAE's nine-month non-oil foreign trade hits $330bn

The UAE's non-oil foreign trade totalled AED1.2 trillion ($330 billion) in the first nine months of 2018, according to preliminary statistical data of the Federal Customs Authority (FCA). The authority said that direct non-oil foreign trade made up 62 percent (AED726.4 billion) of the total, with free zone trade accounting for 37 percent and the remainder seen at customs warehouses. Ali Saeed Al Neyadi, customs commissioner and head of the authority, said that the country's non-oil foreign trade continued to grow and stabilise despite the slowdown witnessed by many international markets in light of the decline in oil prices and limited growth rates in the major economies. According to FCA figures, the value of non-oil imports amounted to AED697.2 billion, with native and semi-proceed gold the most popular, followed by telephone equipment and cars. The value of UAE exports reached AED134.7 billion, with gold representing 22 percent of the total, followed by raw aluminum, cigarettes and gold ornaments and jewelry. The value of re-exports amounted to AED342.2 billion compared to AED325.2 billion of the previous year period achieving a growth rate of 5 percent, the FCA added, with telephone equipment ranking first, followed by non-compounded diamonds, gold ornaments and jewelry. The figures also showed that the Asia-Pacific region was the UAE's biggest trading partner during the period, accounting for 42 percent of the total non-oil trade (AED460.6 billion), followed by Europe. Al Neyadi said that GCC countries continue to be a major component of the UAE's trade relations, with Saudi Arabia named as the largest trading partner in the region.

# UK weather forecast: Britain set for 8INCHES of snow as HURRICANE-FORCE BLIZZARD hits

The latest weather charts show in the next 72 hours the country will be struck with a sustained drumming of snowfall. Only Northern Ireland will be saved from the wintery conditions. However, once the snow begins to clear-up at the start of next week, the UK faces winds as strong as a hurricane. According to the Met Office, the snowfall is set to start tonight. Forecasting Thursday night's conditions, the weather service’s website said: “Snow, initially moving north and east across parts of southern and southwestern England, the Midlands and Wales, will stall and tend to fragment. “Wintry showers will continue in northern and eastern areas. “Ice is likely in many parts overnight.” The snow will then continue over the weekend, with Scotland bearing the brunt of the bad conditions. Weather maps from WXCharts show parts of the Scottish Highlands will be covered by up to 8 inches of throughout Saturday and Sunday. Meanwhile, parts of Wales will be covered by 3.5 inches and parts of the north of England near Middlesborough will also have two inches of snow. By Sunday night the majority of the snow will have disappeared but quick on its tail will be a blizzard of hurricane strength winds. WXCharts shows Northern Ireland and Wales both be hit gales as strong as 75mph. The huge wind forces will hit on Monday morning but will have cleared up by Tuesday. The high speed winds fall just inside the official Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. According to the scale, winds speeds of 74-95mph fall into category 1 hurricane conditions. In its medium-range forecast for Monday, the Met Office warned of “unsettled” conditions “with strong winds possible”.<|im_end|>

# Concealed carry permit holder hailed a hero after shooting, killing gunman inside bar

ARLINGTON, Texas — A customer with a concealed carry permit shot and killed an alleged gunman inside a bar in Arlington, Texas on Wednesday, May 3rd.  Just after 6:00 p.m., police were called to Zona Caliente on South Cooper Street in Arlington.  There, police said 48-year-old James Jones, who had a gun and two knives, shot the manager of the bar, 37-year-old Cesar Perez before being shot by a customer who has a conceal and carry handgun license.  On Thursday, police expanded on what exactly happened when Jones went into the bar. They said he was yelling incoherently, and that’s when Perez walked over to try to calm him down. Police said at that point, Jones shot Perez in the head.  That’s when the concealed carry permit holder stepped up, told his wife to hide and then shot and killed Jones.  One question some had after this incident is whether a person can carry in a bar. The answer is, it depends. In this case, the answer is yes.  “Right now, just with the preliminary information we have, it definitely sounds like that individual tried to do the right thing to prevent further loss of life,” said Lt. Christopher Cook with the Arlington Police Department.  Investigators are looking into whether alcohol and/or drug use, as well as mental health, were factors in the initial shooting.  Police questioned the concealed carry permit holder before he was ultimately released. His name hasn’t been released, but a lot of people have called him a hero, because who knows what would have happened if he hadn’t been there.  The life of the bar manager, Cesar Perez, was remembered during a vigil.  “He was just a great man and would take care of me all the time and he would always say ‘Hey Mijo, how you doing?’ ‘I’m doing great, tio. How are you?’ And just a lot of meaning behind what he told me. He really cared,” said Sebastian Garcias. “He was a great man and he will never be forgotten.”  The investigation is ongoing.<|im_end|>

# 2019 polls: Broadcasting regulator dangles hammer on erring stations - Vanguard News Nigeria

…says politician have refused to learn from past mistake 
…to distribute 5,000 Set-Top Boxes By Emmanuel Elebeke  ABUJA: Ahead of the 2019 general elections, the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC has vowed to sanction some of the broadcast stations in the country for violating the nation’s broadcasting code in the course of their political broadcasts.  The Director General of the Commission, Dr. Modibbo Kawu made this known while briefing the media on the coming 2019 general elections and the Digital Switch Over, DSO in Abuja.  The DG who said the Commission had taken steps to forestall a repeat of past mistakes in 2015, said it had caution the broadcast stations against breaching the extant code but expressed dismay that despite the warning, most of them had continued to violate the code in the course of their political broadcasts and avowed to wild the big stick on them in line with the law.  Dr, Kawu, who specifically mention some TV stations as major culprits said despite series of warning to all the stations, they have gone ahead to violate the rule and therefore must be punished. Other stations mentioned to have violated the code include radio stations.  Kawu, who berated politicians that heat the polity with the use of abusive words and hate speeches said they have refused to learn from their past mistakes.  DSO  On the ongoing Digital Switch Over, DSO, he said ‘‘a lot is happening around the DSO, saying that the Commission will soon commence distribution of 5,000 Set Top Boxes to public institutions as a way of reaching out to all Nigerians with the Free TV services.  In addition, Kawu said the Commission has concluded plan to offer subscribers a value added service on the DSO through the introduction of Push Video on Demand, PVD .  According to him, this is part of efforts by the Commission to deepen the reality of the DSO and the initiative will afford Free TV viewers to access latest Nollywood films at affordable price on demand.  This he also said will address the issue of piracy in the industry.  ‘‘The NBC is going to distribute 5,000 Set Top Boxes around public institutions: hospitals, police stations, schools, military formations, Houses of Assembly, First Class Traditional Rulers, Civil Defence etc.  ‘‘It is a means to push video access on video decoder within the broadcast network. Once you have the Free TV Decoder, you will have access to all Nollywood films and this is dedicated to Nollywood Industry and Kanywood. We hope to address issue of piracy through this. There is no data required, a secure platform and it cannot be hacked.  With a decoder, all a user needs to do is to buy a Dongle and plug it on the back of the Free TV box and you have access to movie.  The movies, according to him are very seamless and rental is N400 for each film for 72 hours.  This is in partnership with Bank of Industry, BoI that has invested in the industry.  This completely changes the economy of film industry.  It will be first launched in Abuja and Kaduna and in following months in other states of the federation.

# Metro Assessor Named Outstanding Member of 2018 - The Tennessee Tribune

NASHVILLE, TN — The TNAAO, a statewide organization representing all 95 county assessors across Tennessee, presented Davidson County Assessor Vivian Wilhoite with its Outstanding New Member of 2018 award during a meeting with the staff of the Assessor’s Office in Nashville. The award recognizes Assessor Wilhoite for “demonstrating professionalism and leadership” in her representation of Davidson County property owners and the assessment profession across the state.  “I’m humbled by this recognition, but it’s the result of the hard work and dedication of the more than 70 staffers of the Assessor’s Office of Metro Nashville and Davidson County,” said Assessor Wilhoite. “As Nashville has experienced phenomenal growth, our office has worked hard each day to keep up with the changes and invested in the technology necessary to make it as easy as possible for property owners to interact with us. I’m grateful for this award and its recognition of our office’s leadership.”  Assessor Wilhoite has undertaken an aggressive program of community outreach, holding more than 130 meetings with community organizations and neighborhood groups, including a first-ever initiative to reach out to deaf and hard of hearing property owners. The Metro Assessor’s Office has also garnered praise for its publication of a “heat map” showing where property values in Davidson County have risen or fallen. During a 2017 state-mandated reappraisal of nearly 250,000 parcels, properties across the county rose an average of 37%.  In addition to her work at the local level, Assessor Wilhoite was praised for her willingness to assist county assessors in rural areas of Tennessee with significantly smaller staffs and fewer resources by sharing best practices and helping to make assessors aware of policy changes at the State Capitol.  “The level of growth being experienced by Nashville is unprecedented,” said Will Denami, executive director, Tennessee Association of Assessing Officers. “Assessor Wilhoite’s willingness to share her knowledge with her colleagues across the state and across the U.S. has been a real asset to our profession and to the goal of ensuring fairness and equity in valuing property.”<|im_end|>

# Guest View: Government transparency must be a priority in Michigan

Guest View: Government transparency must be a priority in Michigan  Last November, the people of Bay and Midland counties put their trust in me to represent their interests in Lansing as their new state representative. I respect that, and I want everyone to be able to hold me accountable.  That's why the first piece of legislation I introduced after taking office last month focuses on increasing government transparency.  Michigan is one of just two states that still exempts its governor, lieutenant governor and the Legislature from sunshine laws. Because of this exemption, Michigan ranks dead last in at least one study on government transparency and ethics. It's no wonder many residents don't have faith in their state government.  We must do better.  The solution I'm sponsoring will strengthen our system of government as a whole by requiring all elected state officials to become more transparent and accountable to the people. The plan, which was developed in a bipartisan manner, will subject the Legislature to a new Legislative Open Records Act (LORA) and the governor and lieutenant governor to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Under current law, people can request access to most public records from local governments, school districts and state departments through FOIA. It only makes sense for state officials to play by the same rules.  We're all here to serve the public, and the public has the right to monitor what we're doing and keep an eye on the way their hard-earned tax dollars are spent.  Just like some documents containing sensitive personal information are exempt from disclosure by local governments under the current FOIA law, the new LORA will exempt some records, including letters to and from people in the district. This way, people can still contact my office for help regarding personal problems without having to worry about their private information being made public.  A similar plan received unanimous, bipartisan support when it passed the House last year.  Unfortunately, the package died before reaching the governor's desk. Reintroducing the plan early this session illustrates our commitment to making government more transparent and this will be a top priority of mine until this legislation is signed into law.  Approving these much-needed reforms will bring more transparency to everything we do at the Capitol and go a long way toward restoring the public's confidence in their state government.  I respect the people's right to know, and I'm committed to serving with openness and honesty. These reforms will give people throughout Michigan the transparency they deserve.

# Parkland Shooting Report Released

The Florida commission that reviewed the actions before, during and after the Parkland high school shooting on Valentine’s Day 2018 has recommended that districts allow trained school teachers to be armed as well as new law enforcement procedures.  By S.T. Patrick  On Valentine’s Day in 2018, a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (MSD) High School in Parkland, Fla. Seventeen students and staff members were killed, while 17 others were injured. Nearly one year later, the MSD Commission investigating the case has made its final recommendations. The commission’s suggestions may be more controversial than the theories surrounding the original case.  The section immediately highlighted and criticized by the local media was the recommendation that Florida educators who volunteer and undergo training be allowed to carry firearms in schools. The teachers union—relatively weak in Florida, a right-to-work state—and the state PTA both oppose the recommendation of the 446-page report that was unanimously approved by the commission.  The report, however, is not law. The Florida state legislature would have to approve the proposals before they could be enacted by the state’s 67 countywide school districts. Every private school, religious and secular, would then have to create their own separate guidelines, as private entities can still legally ban guns on private property.  The more notable areas of the report deal with criticisms of the Broward County Sheriff’s Office, whose active shooter policy is said to have contributed to the chaos of the event. The ambiguous policy of Sheriff Scott Israel read that deputies “may” rather than “shall” or “will” confront an active shooter. This gave several deputies a reason to not enter the building to subdue any threat that may have existed. Even Deputy Scot Peterson, who was assigned as the school’s on-site resource deputy, chose to remain outside.  While Israel expressed his disappointment regarding the inaction of Peterson, he justified the previous policy by saying that he didn’t want law enforcement to engage in “suicide missions.”  Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, an MSD commissioner, described the generally worded active shooter policy. “ ‘May’ gave them [deputies] the out not to enter,” said Sheriff Judd. “They decided to be cowards instead of heroes.”  Broward County has recently changed its active shooter policy, indirectly accepting some responsibility for the failures of law enforcement. The policy now reads “shall” instead of “may,” which, according to the commission, is more consistent with standard law enforcement procedures.  Other suggestions were contained within the report: that law enforcement officers assigned to public schools undergo annual active shooter training, which would include situations when they are alone; that neighboring, local police forces have radios that can easily communicate between cities; that Florida school districts allow law enforcement real-time access to their internal video surveillance systems; and that schools have single, monitored, staffed points of entry and exit.  There was much discussion about safety within classrooms, themselves. The recommendations were that all classrooms have automatically locking doors, windows that can be quickly covered, and two-way intercoms that can be easily accessed in case of emergency. Modern classrooms regularly have school-wide email or messaging systems, but few schools in the age of technology have improved and modernized their intercom systems.  Still perplexing are the mandatory emergency drills conducted by schools every year. Since many school shooters are students who actually attend the school, the mandatory drills do little but to inform the future school shooters of the procedures that will be taken when he or she engages in the act. The mandatory safety drills then become an informational part of the shooter’s planning.  Parkland remains a lightning rod within the alternative political analysis communities. While it appears that a majority of observers do believe that MSDHS was the site of a tragic Valentine’s Day massacre in 2018, there are still some, such as editor Jim Fetzer (The Parkland Puzzle) and commentator Ole Dammegard, who believe that it was a false-flag operation used to heighten the police state and strengthen the anti-gun movement.  The chaos of the day and the ineffective nature of law enforcement behaviors only add to myriad questions that are still asked.  S. T.

# PHOTO RELEASE--Newport News Shipbuilding Dedicates Habitat for Humanity Home, Breaks Ground on 17th Building Project | MarketScreener

NEWPORT NEWS, Va., Jan. 31, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Huntington Ingalls Industries’ (NYSE:HII) Newport News Shipbuilding division hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Wednesday for a new home company volunteers built in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity Peninsula and Greater Williamsburg. The company also broke ground on its 17th joint project. Newport News joined elected officials and community leaders in welcoming Salima Kabwe and her three children to their new home in the city’s southeast community. The three-bedroom house is the 16th constructed since 2002 when Newport News first began working with Habitat. “Like the aircraft carriers and submarines we build at the shipyard, these Habitat for Humanity homes are built with purpose, and they are built with pride,” said Jennifer Dunn, Newport News Shipbuilding’s vice president of communications. “We are proud to lend our support to these projects. “Each Habitat home is unique in its own way, but this home holds a special place in our hearts, because, at the time we broke ground on it last year, we said good-bye to a member of our shipyard family and the Habitat for Humanity team,” Dunn said. Kabwe’s new home was built in memory of Everett H. Jordan Jr., the former director of The Apprentice School who spent 44 years at Newport News, and Ron Nelson, a longtime Habitat construction supervisor. The men met in 2002 when the partnership with Newport News Shipbuilding and Habitat began, and they formed a friendship. Jordan and Nelson died in February 2018 and November 2017, respectively. The ribbon-cutting ceremony was followed by the ground-breaking of a new project less than a quarter mile away. In addition to being the 17th home Newport News will partner to build, it also will be Habitat’s 200th home. “Habitat cannot celebrate the last 200 families without acknowledging all the support, volunteers and funds from the shipyard on the past 16 homes,” said Janet V. Green, CEO of Habitat for Humanity Peninsula and Greater Williamsburg. “Habitat is so fortunate to have such a caring and committed company like the shipyard in our community.” Photos accompanying this release are available at: https://newsroom.huntingtoningalls.com/releases/nns-habitat-homes-2019. Habitat for Humanity Peninsula and Greater Williamsburg is a non-profit organization serving the cities of Hampton, Newport News, Poquoson and Williamsburg and the counties of Charles City, James City, New Kent and York. The local affiliate has built, renovated and repaired more than 250 homes since its founding in 1985. Habitat relies on building partnerships, volunteer labor, and donated materials to continue to produce safe, decent, affordable housing to homeowners with excellent credit, an income between 45-80 percent of the area median income, and the ability to pay for their new Habitat home. Homeowners purchase the new house with a no-interest, 20 to 30-year mortgage carried by Habitat. For more information, visit www.HabitatPGW.org.

# Yeovil hardman Gafaiti begs to stay on with bloodied face after head KO

YEOVIL defender Adel Gafaiti was left with a bloodied face after a horror head clash with his OWN keeper against Notts County on Saturday.  After a corner came into the Yeovil penalty box, the ball sailed over stopper Nathan Baxter, who collided with Gafaiti.  Chelsea loanee Baxter went head-first into his team-mate, who suffered a brutal gash to his head.  The ball continued to ping around the box but Yeovil safely defended it away as attention soon turned to the bloodied Gafaiti. Amazingly hardman Gafaiti, who had blood smeared all over his face, pleaded with the match physio to stay on.  Gafaiti reportedly said: “Don’t take me off, I’m not coming off.”  Though showing great bravery, Yeovil boss Darren Way decided to take the centre-half off with Bevis Mugabi taking his place with a quarter of the game left to play.  Yeovil were 1-0 up at the time of the head clash, thanks to a Thomas James goal eight minutes in, and their lead was doubled moments before full-time. Alex Dorbe made it 2-0 as Yeovil won their second game on the spin - as they sit 20th in League Two.  Way praised the resilience and organisation his his side after securing a vital three points.  MOST READ IN FOOTBALL He said: "Two clean sheets. It feels good; that winning feeling. It's important to realise why the players are playing like they are.  “I think the hard work never lies. We've done that in the last two games.  "I just felt what with the resilience and organisation and discipline throughout the group, that we were never going to lose that game."<|im_end|>

# Good sport for those who beat the big freeze

Lots of weekend matches on our local lakes and fenland drains were called off due to the heavy frosts.  Of those that survived, most produced some decent sport - the March Open at Beggars Bridge on the Twenty Foot Drain being one of them. Some huge weights were topped by Jeff Tuttlebee with 30lb 6oz of quality roach taken on a short whip line with pinkie over groundbait. Runner-up was Mark Barron, who caught on the same method for 18lb 5oz, then came Richard Linnell on 16lb 10oz. STANJAY OPEN The Stanjay Open on the Twenty Foot Drain, Old Nene at Benwick and Factory Bank also managed to survive. There was a huge turnout and although anglers had to break ice in most sections it fished remarkably well. The worst section was at Factory Bank where Spalding rod Mick Dixon took the top spot with 6lb 5oz. The Old Nene at Benwick was much better. Dave Brown came first here with a net of small roach taken on the pole and whip for 15lb 5oz followed by Cameron Hughes with 14lb 13oz. Best of all though was the Twenty Foot Drain at March which saw Guy Smith put a fine 24lb mixed bag of silver fish to the scales from his peg close to the bridges. March rod Alex Bates did well in the same area, finishing with 22lb 10oz to give him the runner-up spot, then came England star, Steve Hemingray with 17lb 12oz. CASTAWAYS Castaways moved their match on Sunday from the Carrot Wash to Beggars Bridge and what a good decision it proved to be - especially for Mike Mohan, who took top spot with a very good roach weight of 10lb 12oz. Runner-up was Peter Molesworth with 8lb 8oz of small roach and perch and three lads shared third place all with 6lb 12oz. They were Mike Smith, Mel Saggers and Des Dalton. RAMSEY Perhaps the only angling club in the area to complete their fixtures over the last few days were Ramsey and District AS. Wednesday’s match on the Old Nene at Ramsey St Mary’s saw Stu Cheetham top the field from peg six with 13lb 7oz - a net of roach taken on the long pole with hemp. John Locke was second fishing pinkie over groundbait for 9lb 7oz followed by Harry Young with 5lb 15oz. Sunday’s match was on the same venue but obviously with the heavy frost, weights were not as good. Malc Plant took first place in this one from peg three with 7lb 14oz. Runner-up was Matt Page, who weighed in 5lb 8oz, then came Stu Cheetham on 4lb 14oz. Also on Sunday was the club’s Angling Trust Pike match on the Narrows which saw just eight fish in total weighed in. Top rod with two pike was Mark Speed, who had a total weight of 18lb 6oz. In second spot was Martin Smith with 12lb 9oz then in third place came Keith Rayment. He had just one fish weighing 10lb 2oz and that turned out to be the largest fish caught on the day.<|im_end|>

# Lawsuits hit Canadians accused of illegal downloading, uploading of movies | Globalnews.ca

Lawsuits hit Canadians accused of illegal downloading, uploading of movies  Anya Morgante of Toronto says she can’t believe she’s being sued for allegedly sharing a copy of a film featuring Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson. “I am not a pirate,” she said, a term often used to describe people who share copyrighted works like movies without permission or payment. But Morgante is just one of about 3,400 Canadians facing legal actions in Federal Court launched by a prestigious Toronto law firm on behalf of U.S. movie production companies attempting to enforce their copyright claims.  “There is no such thing as a free lunch,” said lawyer Ken Clark, a partner at Aird & Berlis LLP, who is spearheading the litigation.  “If you get caught, you have to pay,” he said. One of Clark’s clients, Bodyguard Productions, Inc., made the Hollywood film A Hitman’s Bodyguard, described as a “genuine smash hit” by Forbes Magazine, earning more than US$70 million when it was released in 2017, according to the publication. But producers and distributors said they believe they have lost significant additional revenue to video pirates who are sharing the movie online for free in violation of copyright legislation, including Canada’s Copyright Act. “We are trying to educate people and make it sting a little,” Clark told Global News, describing how his law firm is methodically sending out hundreds of legal claims against Canadians who shared the movie.  Clark’s law firm sent Morgante a statement of claim in December, 2017, alleging infringement after the movie was shared through her Rogers internet service. The claim has not been proven in court. “It’s been stressful,” Morgante said in an interview, denying she watched or shared the movie. However, she acknowledged it was possible someone else in her home or someone who had access to Wi-Fi service did. “I’m not even computer-savvy,” said Morgante, adding she did not receive any notice from Rogers alleging her account had been used improperly.  She said she has a Netflix subscription, uses pay-per-view television and goes to the cinema when she wants to watch movies. Clark said his client isn’t interested in going after those who merely download video content, but internet users who shared videos with others — something detected by sophisticated sniffer software used by movie companies. “We send warning notices for a reason: to put the owner of the (internet) account on notice,” he said, adding they would not take legal action against anyone who had not received at least two emailed warnings first. He said they would only take action if the person in question ignored the warnings. In response to the claim, Morgante said she got advice from a legal clinic and then submitted a statement of defence. She said she didn’t share the movie, nor does she believe anyone else in her household did.  In January, she received an offer to settle the claim. “The subject defendant shall pay to the Plaintiff the sum of $3,000, inclusive of costs for damages,” the statement said. “It’s not fair. It’s crazy. They should have to prove [their case],” Morgante said. The law firm had been prepared to accept a lower amount of $150 to settle the claim at a later point, but she said paying any amount would amount to an admission of guilt. “It’s the principle,” she said.  Clark said his law firm listens to consumers individually and doesn’t want to litigate against those who have a valid explanation for movie sharing. He said defendants have paid various amounts ranging from $100 to $5000 to settle the claims. Although to date no federal judge has ruled in favour of his clients against someone accused of illegal downloading or uploading, Clark said “we have cases in court.” Clark also warned consumers against the use of so-called Android boxes, devices sold with the promise of free television and free movie content. He said those devices are used to redistribute copyrighted content and may also violate laws. “No law allows people to get something for nothing,” he said.  © 2019 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.<|im_end|>

# Man destroyed American flag on FDNY ambulance: authorities

An unpatriotic vandal was busted for destroying an American flag “that was proudly displayed” on the back of an FDNY ambulance in Manhattan, fire officials said.  Nicholas Leobold, 50, was captured on dashcam footage, released by the FDNY, going after the flag at around 2:30 p.m. Jan. 25 while the ambulance was parked at Second Avenue and East 9th Street in the East Village, according to officials.  When paramedics returned to the ambulance, they found that the US flag had been cut in two and thrown into a puddle of water on the street.  Leobold, who has no priors, was arrested by FDNY fire marshals Wednesday and charged with criminal mischief for the incident.<|im_end|>

# How To Bulk Up Your Process Advantage

I reconnected with Pegasystems‘ (PEGA) CEO Alan Trefler recently. Since my first interview with him in 2010, the enterprise software company’s stock price has grown (granted erratically) by about 50% and its revenue has expanded to $460M from $335M. PEGA’s growth points to an opportunity I find companies forget too often and an opportunity to those of us willing to see things differently. This opportunity has popped up repeatedly in the last two weeks. We worked with a leading consumer packaged goods company who came up with an idea to launch a new business in an emerging market space. They could figure out the product and branding–there is certainly enough expertise in those spaces–but even the greatest product and branding would be worth naught if they didn’t also rethink how they invoice their retailing partners. We met with an executive at large pharma company, and when we explored their biggest barriers to innovation, she immediately said, “How can we cut down the time it takes to launch a new partnership from months to weeks?” Wait. Don’t put this blog aside yet. I know “process” is perhaps the last topic you want to think about. We want innovation to mean beauty and simple designs and community and creativity. Process seems to mean the opposite. But perhaps that is precisely why there are such exciting opportunities to be found by rethinking the “how” of your new “what.” Consider the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), based in Singapore, which came from being well below the industry average in customer satisfaction (as measured by their Net Promoter Score) to being the clear #1 in a recent Bain study. OCBC didn’t depend on new banking products or a marketing campaign. Instead they rethought some of their processes. The bank uses PEGA software on top of its back-office program that allows it to experiment more rapidly than their competition. If someone calls, the bank representative can engage the customer using a shared screen and offer various products. This software learns from the history of other clients and suggests that the representative offer specific products and even permutations of products. The system is continually experimenting and learning–so with each interaction, the experience gets better. It may figure out (this is just my hypothetical example) that working mothers care more about online banking so they can bank after the kids go to bed. Other banks, by contrast, code in a set of rules that do not learn, do not adapt. This means that with every new interaction, the OCBC system gets better, stretching out its advantage over its peers. Imagine you meet two friends for coffee every week. One learns and adapts. By the third week you are past the basics and talking about childhoods and passions. The other adapts only slowly so that by the third week you are still telling them your name and whether you like coffee in your milk or not. Now multiply this advantage by hundreds of customers a day, thousands of interactions a week, and you can quickly see which friend will become more popular. When I tended bar during college, I learned the lesson quickly. Know you regulars’ drink preferences, remember their names, pick up your last conversation, and your tips grow. The problem most large companies have is that they confuse what Trefler calls “memory” with “muscle.” Your enterprise systems (SAP, Oracle, etc.) are great repositories of memory. But unless you have really optimized a process, you want it to strengthen and improve. You want to build muscle. This is what PEGA’s technology allows you to do, build muscle on top of your memory. Process is one of eight dimensions on which you should look for innovation. The others are product, positioning, people, physical experience, pricing, promotion and placement (or channels). Are you building muscle across all of these? I’m working on a set of exercises for each of these “P”s to help us bulk up. I’ll it send out next week. Register at www.kaihan.net to get your copy.

# PGA fine-tuning its Frisco master plan

PGA fine-tuning its Frisco master plan  ORLANDO, Fla. -- In just under two months since the announcement that the PGA of America is moving its headquarters to Frisco, pieces to the giant 600-acre puzzle are emerging.  Ground will be broken on the two 18-hole golf courses in the fall, giving the courses two full growing seasons before hosting the first championship, the KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship in May of 2023. "Our goal is to have the entire campus complete by summer 2022," PGA chief operating officer Darrell Crall said in an interview at the PGA Merchandise Show. "Our first task is to complete the master plan, figuring out where all the puzzle pieces fit together." The primary pieces are the two courses, the nine-hole short course, the PGA headquarters and the Omni resort and conference center. Architects Gil Hanse and Beau Welling have done routing plans for the courses, and stakes are in the ground showing likely locations for fairways and greens. Both courses and the nine-hole course will be open to the public, including the Frisco ISD golf teams. The PGA will operate the courses but won't own them. Crall said the architects are involved in biweekly meetings on the design aspects. He added that he was "super impressed" by the property during his tours. "The movement of the ground is fantastic," he said.  As for the headquarters, Crall said, "We have a very good idea of where it is going to be. Every inch matters." He estimated the headquarters would be 100,000 square feet with 125-150 staff members when it opens. Crall and PGA chief executive officer Seth Waugh said the PGA would maintain a presence with 100 or more staffers in South Florida, where the organization has been based for 60 years. "It made business sense to move," Waugh said during a media briefing at the show. "The root of it is we needed to do something in Florida. The building is 60 years old. Something had to give." Waugh said the Frisco campus has the potential to become a Silicon Valley, suggesting that it could become a hub of golf. "If you create a critical mass with a mind-set around it," he said, "build it and they will come." One major event that won't be coming to Texas, Crall said, is the PGA Merchandise Show, which attracted an estimated 40,000 industry professionals and 1,000 leading golf companies to the Orange County Convention Center for the show that concluded Friday.  "We have no plans but to continue to grow and enhance this show," Crall said. "We're thrilled with what we have here." Twitter: @markkazlowski<|im_end|>

# Police: Deadly injuries to infant caused by father

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (WAND) – A man accused of causing deadly injuries to an infant is behind bars. Police say Champaign man Jaytwon Mobley, 20, caused serious head injuries to a 4-month-old child in January.

# Behati Prinsloo nursed by Adam Levine after wisdom teeth removal

Getting your wisdom teeth out is pretty miserable for anyone, but Behati Prinsloo is trying to make the best of her painful situation by posting hilarious videos and pictures of her recovery. She first shared a clip on Instagram on August 25 returning home from the dentist with her face wrapped in ice singing along to the hit song "I Can't Feel My Face." "My perfect day...LOL bye bye wisdoms," she captioned the hilarious video. "#icantfeelmyface." 
		 
	Upon returning home, the Victoria's Secret model revealed she has some of the best help possible: her husband 
	Adam Levine. The 26-year-old shared a snap laying in bed with her rock star beau holding a teddy bear. "My nurse is the perfect combination of sexy and cute," she captioned the GIF of Adam making silly faces. "Update: day 2 after removing my wisdom teeth SUCK!!!!!!" 
		 Perhaps unable to sleep, Behati took to Instagram again to share another photo laying in bed with an ice pack and teddy bear wearing a sweater that read "Behati." She simply wrote alongside the black and white pic, "On point." This uncomfortable bonding experience comes after the couple recently celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary, after marrying last July at Flora Farms in Los Cabos, Mexico.   The model isn't the only celeb to share about getting their wisdom teeth out. Miley Cyrus posted a few pics of her recovery process in March, including ones of her actual teeth. Rita Ora posted an Instagram video of herself after having her wisdom teeth removed. Groggy and covered with a blanket, the British singer tried to talk to her friend before falling asleep. Lastly, Ariana Grande showed off her puffy cheeks after the surgery, but still rocked cat-eyed eyeliner.<|im_end|>

# Comic Sans Gets A Makeover

Call me mad if you will, but I think Comic Sans gets a bad rap. And I’m not the only one. While the mere sight of the font is enough to make some type purists scream, rip out their eyes, then bite off their tongue, I think that Comic Sans is actually a pretty incredible typeface. And Comic Neue, a new would-be successor, might be even better. First, let’s talk a bit about Comic Sans, the world’s most reviled font. As it was designed by Vincent Connare for Microsoft’s kid-friendly Bob operating system–an operating system it was bizarrely never used in–Comic Sans was a pudgy, slightly clumsy, but otherwise affable font. It looked like the hand lettering of a comic book. The effect was very much by design: Connare needed a font that looked more appropriate when coming out of Bob’s cartoon OS assistants than Times New Roman or other overly formal fonts. Comic Sans was limited, sure, but lots of typefaces are designed to be used in only specific circumstances. Trajan might look great on a poster for a movie about a Roman centurion, but probably shouldn’t be used on a box of breakfast cereal. Likewise, Comic Sans looks great on a preschool sign, but wildly out of place on an accountant’s business card. The problem with Comic Sans is that it was too good at being friendly to people who didn’t really feel comfortable around computers. When it was eventually included as a default font in Windows 95, plebs by the thousands started choosing it for everything they’d once used Times New Roman for: emails, Word documents, signs, and so on. Vilified as typography’s antichrist, there mere mention of Vincent Connare’s name now will usually lead to a snort of derision at best, and the spontaneous forming of a lynch mob at worst. All for designing a typeface that was just too adept at looking friendly for its own good. Which brings us to Comic Neue. Designed recently by Australian designer Craig Rozynski, Comic Neue is an attempt to polish some of Comic Sans’s rough edges–to create a type family that is just a little more sophisticated, a dash more urbane than Comic Sans’s bumpkinish simplicity, meant for people who want to use Comic Sans but not look like rubes. It comes in two variants. Comic Neue takes what Rozynski calls the “squashed, wonky, and weird glyphs” of Comic Sans and beats them into shape, while Comic Neue Angular gives Comic Sans an extra dose of refinement by replacing the font’s round terminals with angular ones instead. Both varieties are available in light, regular, and bold weights, with oblique equivalents. If Comic Sans resembles the handwriting of a 10-year old with excellent penmanship, Comic Neue is the block lettering of that same kid as a high school senior. Rozynski probably overstates it a bit when he says that Comic Neue will make your kid’s lemonade stand look like a Fortune 500 company, but it certainly seems that, at the very least, Comic Neue is less likely to get your kid’s lemonade stand immolated with a Molotov Cocktail by some psychopathic type snob than Comic Sans would. Surprisingly, though, Vincent Connare himself doesn’t seem to care for it. The vilified typographer’s only comment on Comic Neue so far has been to say that it’s not casual enough. Oh, Vincent. Ever the pariah. You can download Comic Neue for free here.<|im_end|>

# Rizal Commercial Banking : Bangladesh sues Philippine bank over cyberheist at New York Fed | MarketScreener

In a complaint filed on Thursday night with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Bangladesh Bank accused Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) and dozens of other defendants of involvement in a massive multi-year conspiracy to steal its money. Bangladesh Bank said funds stolen with the help of unnamed North Korean hackers were funnelled through RCBC accounts in New York City and eventually to the Philippines, where much of it disappeared in that country's casino industry. RCBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment after market hours. It had said on Wednesday, after learning the lawsuit would be filed: "We welcome this complaint, as it is an opportunity for RCBC to put on record again that it was a victim of what was started in Bangladesh by still unnamed persons." The case arose from a February 2016 incident in which hackers tricked the New York Fed into sending $81 million belonging to Bangladesh Bank to four accounts held in fake names at an RCBC branch in Makati City. Most of the money was quickly withdrawn, and only about $15 million has been recovered. RCBC, based in Manila, has contended that the theft was an inside job and has accused Bangladesh Bank of a cover-up.

# NBA: Former MVP Russell Westbrook and Toronto Raptors star Kyle Lowry head list of reserves for All-Star game - Firstpost

Los Angeles: Former most valuable player Russell Westbrook and Toronto Raptors star Kyle Lowry head the list of reserves announced on Thursday for the NBA All-Star game.  Oklahoma City Thunder guard Westbrook received his eighth all-star selection while Lowry was chosen to his fifth straight game.  Westbrook was the MVP of the 2015 and 2016 all-star games.  The other reserves named Thursday include four first-time all-stars comprising Philadelphia 76ers guard Ben Simmons, Orlando Magic centre Nikola Vucevic, Denver Nuggets centre Nikola Jokic and Milwaukee Bucks forward Khris Middleton.  The seven reserves from both the East and West Conferences will join the 10 starters who were announced last week.  There is no East versus West format for this year's game. The players' names will now go into a hat and will be selected by captains LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers and Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks.  The defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors will have three all-stars, with reserve Klay Thompson joining starters Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.  LaMarcus Aldridge's selection as a reserve extends San Antonio's streak of having at least one all-star to 21 consecutive years, the league's longest active run.  One all-star missing is Indiana Pacers guard Victor Oladipo, who underwent surgery earlier this week to repair a torn right quadriceps tendon.  The all-star game will be played February 17 in Charlotte, N.C.  Firstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

# Sydney trip off for Sniper

SUCH is the aura around Ultimate Sniper, you could hear the sigh of relief when Mark Purdon said his Sydney trip was off. Leading the charge was top local trainer , who has the now logical NSW Derby favourite Muscle Factory. Remembering Ultimate Sniper was a $1.70 favourite for the NSW Derby in Aussie prepost markets before Purdon ruled him out today (Thursday). Instead, Purdon said the All Stars’ Victoria Derby runner-up Im Anothermasterpiece was staying in Australia to tackle the NSW Derby. He was quickly added to betting markets as equal favourite with Muscle Factory, who beat him in the Victoria Derby. “It’s certainly helps us not having Ultimate Sniper coming after what’s he done in NZ. Maybe we scared him off,” Tritton smiled. Ultimate Sniper was the second big name All Stars’ horse to defect from Sydney’s Carnival of Miracles this week. Earlier, Inter Dominion finalists Spankem, the long-time Chariots of Fire favourite, was scratched from Saturday night’s Paleface Adios owing to a virus. He’s heading home. It’s a huge weekend in NSW ahead with the $100,000 Group 1 Newcastle Mile on Friday night and the Paleface Adios at Menangle on Saturday night. Trainer holds the key at Newcastle with defending champion Majordan (gate three, $1.40) and exciting four-year-old Picard (gate four, $3.30). “I can’t split them. Picard is absolutely flying and Majordan is on the way up. They’re two great changes,” he said. In Picard’s case, a win would create a dilemma because the conditions of the Newcastle Mile state the winner cannot race again before the Miracle Mile. However, because Picard was already qualified for the Chariots before accepting to race at Newcastle, it’s different for him. HRNSW has told Pizzuto that Picard cannot run in both the Chariots and Miracle Mile if he wins at Newcastle. “I have to tell them by 9am Monday which race I’m going to. Even if I go to the Chariots and Picard wins that, he’s not allowed to run in the Miracle. It’s crazy,” he said. Despite Spankem’s scratching, the All Stars still holds the key to the Paleface Adios at Menangle with comeback star Chase Auckland $1.90 favourite from gate two. They also have $13 All U Need Is Faith from gate nine. Much interest centres on Tasmanian star Ignatius, who smashed the clock first-up in the Hondo Grattan last week and will be fitter. He’s a $3 shot despite a wide draw (gate 10).  Adam Hamilton<|im_end|>

# Possible third Salisbury suspect 'flew back to Russia days after poisoning'

A possible third Russian suspect linked to the poisoning of a former spy in Salisbury flew back to Moscow via a European city a few days after the attack, an investigative website has claimed. Bellingcat said Sergey Fedotov - who the website claims is a Russian military intelligence officer using a false name - was due to travel back to Russia on the same London flight as two other GRU officers who Britain identified as prime suspects in the attempted assassination.  But instead of catching that flight on 4 March last year - the same day Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double-agent, and his daughter Yulia were targeted with a novichok nerve agent - Fedotov checked himself out of the plane a few minutes prior to take-off, according to Bellingcat.  "He flew back to Moscow from another European capital a few days later," it said in a report posted on Thursday night in collaboration with The Insider, a Russian partner website, and a Bulgarian investigative partner outlet called Capital. It was claimed his movements were similar to another journey he allegedly took in April 2015 to Bulgaria around the time a Bulgarian defence industry businessman suddenly fell sick.  Fedotov was due to fly out of Sofia on 28 April 2015 - the same day Emilian Gebrev was taken to hospital after collapsing at a reception he was hosting in Sofia, according to the piece.  "He did not show up for the return flight. Instead, late on the evening of April 28, he showed up at Istanbul's Ataturk airport and bought a last-minute ticket to a flight to Moscow," it said.  Bellingcat reported that Mr Gebrev subsequently fell into a coma. "Doctors surmised that the poison had been applied or consumed in the day or days preceding April 28th. However, as they could not identify the poison, they could not be sure of its effects or mode of progression," it said.  Two laboratories with knowledge of nerve agents were allegedly unable to identify the poison conclusively. But they "discovered traces of two different organophosphates in Mr Gebrev's urine sample: one of which they could identify as a strong pesticide, while the other remained unidentifiable with the standard testing tools for chemical weapons", the report said. Mr Gebrev's condition improved and he was discharged from hospital a month later. However, the investigative website quoted him as saying he fell ill again in May around the same time as another alleged visit to Bulgaria by Fedotov. Mr Gebrev was quoted as telling Bellingcat that he did not know why the GRU might want to target him.  The British authorities have only ever named two Russian military intelligence officers in the poisoning of the Skripals, using their aliases, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. Bellingcat last year revealed their true identities - Colonel Alexander Mishkin and Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga. Both men deny any involvement in the attack and claimed in a Russian television interview that they had been visiting Salisbury as "tourists". Bellingcat said a fuller version of its investigation would be published next week.<|im_end|>

# Pressure to repeal Obamacare is now on moderate Republicans

Moderate Republicans in the House are suddenly feeling a whole lot of heat.  After weeks of hushed negotiations, GOP lawmakers this week touted a new amendment to a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare that was yanked from the House floor last month. That amendment won over the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which officially announced Wednesday that it would support the revised measure.  What this means is that the future of the GOP’s efforts to dismantle Obamacare now overwhelmingly rests with moderate Republicans.  It’s an unenviable choice for these lawmakers: Vote for an unpopular bill that experts say would hurt people with pre-existing conditions, or risk getting blamed for refusing to help their party repeal Obamacare, not to mention buck their own president.  Following a closed-door meeting of the Tuesday Group on Wednesday, moderate lawmakers signaled that they were hardly eager to throw their support behind the new proposal.  GOP Rep. Charlie Dent, a leader of the group, remains opposed to the legislation. Others like Rep. Frank LoBiondo also said they would not get behind the bill, citing concerns raised by constituents back home. Lawmakers returned to Washington this week after a two-week Easter recess.  “Closely reviewing changes, but see none of Medicaid concerns addressed. VERY REAL for #SouthJersey,” LoBiondo tweeted Wednesday.  One moderate Republican who spoke anonymously put it this way to CNN: “I spent the whole work period hearing from people pissed about pre-existing conditions. This isn’t helpful.”  The development has also exacerbated already raw tensions between the conservative and moderates wings of the House.  “(It’s) an exercise in blame shifting,” Dent told reporters.  There is also griping about the decision by Rep. Tom MacArthur — a New Jersey moderate Republican — to negotiate the amendment with Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows.  Before the Easter break, Dent said that members of the Tuesday Group had asked leaders of the group not to negotiate one-on-one with Meadows. Asked if he was upset with MacArthur or why MacArthur had struck a deal with Meadows, Dent told reporters that the question should be directed to MacArthur.  MacArthur defended his position to reporters Wednesday, saying the amendment was aimed at shrinking the gap between the two factions of the House GOP.  “The latest proposal I made was just trying to bridge this divide between people that are holding two important views: people that are saying ‘we’re not going to fix health care unless we bring the cost down, which means we have to give the states some flexibility,'” he said. “And, people that are saying ‘we can’t pull the rug out from under people that are vulnerable.’ And, I agree with both of those. They are both right positions, and my amendment was just meant to bridge the divide between those two.”  He added, “I think anybody who is wavering feels some pressure because the vast majority of our conference wants to pass this bill.”  Moderates have serious grievances about the House GOP bill.  They are concerned about weakening the protections for people with pre-existing conditions — a major reason that the MacArthur amendment is not sitting well with a significant swath of the House GOP conference.  Some members are also troubled that the House bill would severely cut back funding for Medicaid, which provides health coverage for many opioid addicts in their districts. Several GOP governors in states that expanded Medicaid to low-income adults were pushing representatives to revise these provisions in the House bill.  Another concern is the estimate that millions of people would lose their health care coverage as a result of the bill. The Congressional Budget Office projected that 24 million fewer people would be covered under an early version of the Republican bill, which did not include later changes to insurance reforms.  Moderates are also cognizant that many of their older constituents would not be happy with the bill, which allows insurers to charge higher premiums to those in their 50s and early 60s. The AARP has promised to inform all its 38 million members how lawmakers voted on the GOP health care bill.  These concerns are shared by the American public.  Only 17% of voters approved of the House bill, according to a Quinnipiac poll released last month.  A more recent Quinnipiac poll found that only 36% of American voters say Republicans in Congress should try again to repeal and replace Obamacare, while 60% say the Republicans should “move on.”  Voters disapprove by a 65% to 29% margin of the way Trump is handling health care.<|im_end|>

# Beyond Food secures $1m to scale food upcycling tech

Beyond Food, the Canadian start-up developing sustainable food upcycling technology, has secured $1 million in seed funding from a mix of industry and sports investors.  The funding round was led by several notable investors including cable communications pioneer Stu Rath and environmental technology inventor Jamie Bagnell.  “I’ve been involved with Beyond Food since its inception; the company is breaking new ground in sustainable food technology,” says Rath.  Several professional athletes including Joe Thornton (San Jose Sharks), Adam Lowry (Winnipeg Jets), and John-Michael Liles (Colorado Avalanche, Toronto Maple Leafs) also invested.  Beyond Food manufactures plant-based functional foods and sports nutrition products under the brand TDF Sports.  One of its key products is the Zero Waste Pod, a patent-pending technology that at scale promises to “dramatically improve issues related to food waste, the environment and food insecurity”.  “Our Zero Waste Pod is a first in this race to tackle the large challenges related to the excessive food waste occurring in North America and beyond,” says Dr Darren Burke, Beyond Food’s Co-Founder and CEO.  Using a proprietary process the Zero Waste Pod converts fresh fruit and vegetables into fine milled, whole plant powders packed with nutrients with a long shelf life.  In 2018 Beyond Food launched its first sports nutrition brand, TDF Sports, to showcase its sustainable technology.  The company said this recent funding will help it to expand its engineering and sales teams as well as develop new partnerships with key organisations, universities and grocers.<|im_end|>

# Justice is about more than just Chiang - Taipei Times

While attending a Lunar New Year banquet for veteran entertainers on Tuesday last week, former singer Lisa Cheng (鄭心儀) slapped Minister of Culture Cheng Li-chiun (鄭麗君) because she disagreed with her policy of transforming the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and support for transitional justice. Interestingly, this incident happened just as Cheng was talking to actor Chen Sung-young (陳松勇), who played Lin Wen-heung (林文雄), the eldest son of the Lin family, in the film A City of Sadness (悲情城市), for which he won the Best Leading Actor award at the 26th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 1989, and which became one of his most famous roles. Director Hou Hsiao-hsien’s (侯孝賢) film was released 30 years ago this year. As well as being honored with the Golden Lion award for best film at the Venice Film Festival, the movie also brought renewed prosperity to its setting — the picturesque town of Jiufen (九份) in the mountains of what is now New Taipei City. However, the aspect of the film that drew the most attention was that it tackled the sensitive subject of the 228 Incident in 1947. The film is set when Japan’s colonial rule of Taiwan had just come to an end and the Republic of China’s nationalist government had taken over. With the tribulations of the Lin family as its central narrative, the film reflects the ways in which Taiwanese reacted to the “return to the motherland,” with hopeful expectation turning into disappointment, anger and frustration. It touches upon matters such as widespread searches, arrests, torture and “forced disappearances.” Transitional justice is a way for states to compensate for the illegalities and injustices of the past.  The question of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall is just one small part of transitional justice in Taiwan, which includes many other issues and processes. Last year, the government announced two batches of cancelations of guilty verdicts from the Chinese Nationalist Party’s (KMT) authoritarian period, thus restoring the reputations of 2,775 victims of political persecution. Other tasks include opening political files, eliminating the remnants of authoritarianism and conducting investigations into ill-gotten party assets. All of these fall within the scope of transitional justice, and all have come under fire from the KMT. As transitional justice treads on the toes of vested interests, it can easily provoke backlashes when put into practice. Due to Taiwan’s complex historical and political background, transitional justice tends to be strongly associated with unification versus independence, and with issues among different communities. This often creates additional obstacles. Taiwan went through 38 years of martial law and “White Terror,” and more cases of injustice keep emerging. These cases involve people from every community, including those from various Chinese provinces, as well as Taiwan. “Mainlanders” form a larger proportion of the victims than they do of the general population. The repression of those years sent many people to their deaths, while countless others lost their security and freedom. Taiwan’s road to democracy has been very bumpy, and we are only beginning to confront historical mistakes. Vague opposition to the removal of positive references and symbols to do with Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石) is a straw-man argument. We should not allow it to misrepresent the overall core values of transitional justice.<|im_end|>

# Iran Slams U.S. Over Venezuela. Secretly, Some May Be Relieved

(Bloomberg) -- Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez wore his trademark fatigues over a red T-shirt as he and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran grinned and cut the ribbon to inaugurate their joint lender. The two presidents’ attendance at the 2009 ceremony in Tehran -- the Iran Venezuela Bi-National Bank officially opened its doors the following year -- was a sign of their affinity and mutual determination. Handed $200 million and set up with a board of directors from both nations, the bank was intended to fund areas from infrastructure to energy to bring the Islamic and Bolivarian republics closer. The intervening decade has taken its toll, as Chavez’s death and Venezuela’s economic crisis saw the bank’s fortunes go into decline. A visit this week to its headquarters in a five-storey building in a commercial area of downtown Tehran found little evidence of activity. Just one customer made use of counter services and a solitary client withdrew cash from the ATM outside. Two clerks said accounts were mostly held by businesses, and suggested regular depositors would be better served at a domestic bank. A public affairs official referred questions about the institution’s status and the extent of its ties to Venezuela to the lender’s new chief executive, who was not immediately available for comment. However, a previous managing director, Davoud Banaei, was candid about the bank’s difficulties in an interview with the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency published in late 2016. With its original capital, “the intention was that by now that investment would reach $1 billion, but because of Venezuela’s financial problems, this objective hasn’t been reached,” Banaei said. He cited as reasons low volumes of bilateral trade, problems of transparency, currency fluctuations and Venezuela’s aversion to using hard currency. As a result, the bank was looking for other partners. “While Venezuela is a shareholder of this bank, we prefer in the current circumstances not to carry out any work with the country as there is a possibility that our money could halve in value when it returns to us,” Banaei was quoted as saying. That explanation was echoed by another of the bank’s board members in a separate interview published in October last year. Revolutionary Heritage The fate of the joint lender shines a light on the state of relations between the two countries. United by a revolutionary heritage and a shared status as major oil producers, both are now subject to sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. But while some Iranians are outraged at what they see as brazen U.S. interference aimed at ending Nicolas Maduro’s presidency, some may also welcome the spotlight being, if only briefly, on Venezuela and not Iran. With the U.S. focused on Maduro, the likelihood of targeting Iran -- possibly even militarily -- recedes, albeit for now. What’s more, the effective U.S. block on exports of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. announced this week potentially offers a boost for Iranian crude. “For the leadership this is a good deflection from the pressure they have been receiving,” said Sanam Vakil, an associate fellow at Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Program in London. “It’s quite a useful crisis for Iran right now at a time when the economy is really faltering,” she said. “It doesn’t mean that they’re not anxious or don’t fear further pressure. But the breathing room is an opportunity.” Iran’s ties with Venezuela arguably reached their zenith under Chavez and Ahmadinejad. But a lot has happened since: As Venezuela sank into crisis, Iran elected a new, more moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, and negotiated a landmark deal with world powers that offered an economic lifeline in return for commitments to curb its nuclear program. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision last year to unilaterally withdraw from the pact and reimpose sanctions on Iran has been resisted by Europe, Russia and China. The European Union joined the U.S. in tightening the screws on Maduro -- the bloc says it will follow Trump in recognizing National Assembly leader Juan Guaido unless Maduro calls fresh elections. But on Iran, it has defied Trump by setting up a special purpose vehicle for companies aimed at evading U.S. sanctions. Joint Exercises Iran’s government and military look to be doubling down on their support for Maduro regardless. Iran is preparing to take part in military exercises with Venezuela this month, according to a person in Caracas familiar with the planning. Known as Operation Angostura, the exercises will involve Nicaragua and Cuba and take place from Feb. 10-15, said the person. Iran’s Defense Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami attended Maduro’s inauguration last month. In a meeting with Maduro he spoke of “the victory of Venezuela’s revolutionary government” and the defeat of “a U.S. plot,” according to a report on Iran state TV. Iran and Venezuela’s closeness has enabled the Islamic Republic to increase its commercial reach during an era of continuous U.S. pressure and international efforts to isolate its economy. A tractor plant, cement factory and a 10,000-unit housing complex are among the results. Iran’s biggest-carmaker, the state-run Iran Khodro Company (IKCO), opened a plant in 2005 two hours drive from Caracas as part of a joint-venture with the Venezuelan government known as VenIrauto, state-run Press TV reported. Chavez was pictured driving one. In June 2015, Iran agreed to extend a $500 million credit line to Venezuela. Maduro said at the time that economic cooperation would help Caracas in an “economic war” with the U.S. U.S. ‘Meddling’ “Iran supports the legitimate government and people of Venezuela in the face of DC’s illegal meddling,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi told reporters on Jan. 19, IRNA reported. Venezuelan Ambassador Carlos Antonio Alcala Cordones hosted an event in the embassy in Tehran this week at which he spoke of the countries’ “common enemy.” The event, touted as an expression of solidarity with Maduro’s regime, was attended by Iranian conservatives. “People who belong to the reform movement, they are not really concerned too much about Venezuela” and were not present, said Foad Izadi, assistant professor of American studies at the Faculty of World Studies, University of Tehran, who did attend. All the same, Izadi was skeptical that Iran can avoid the attention of U.S. hawks for long. People like Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton “are totally obsessed with Iran,” he said. “I don’t think dealing with Venezuela would be enough to take Iran off their minds.” --With assistance from Esteban Duarte.

# How Hurricane Sandy Moved JetBlue To Find Innovation In Collaboration–And Korean BBQ Tacos

For the Belle Harbor neighborhood in New York’s Hurricane Sandy-devastated Rockaways, the parking lot of the now shuttered Waldbaum’s grocery store has become a makeshift mess hall and the first station on the slow climb out of disaster. FEMA is there, and so is the Red Cross. The National Guard is distributing water, blankets, and MREs. Across the lot, crowds line up for relief meals of a very different sort. Rickshaw Dumplings, and KorillaBBQ, two stars of New York’s food truck revolution, are here to distribute lunch as part of one of the more unique aid efforts to appear in the wake of this calamity. That food trucks would be part of the recovery work–given the gas shortages–is slightly surprising. But how these trucks arrived in this part of Belle Harbor makes the story that much more unlikely. In the immediate aftermath of Sandy, crewmembers (or execs to you and me) at the New York-based airline JetBlue were searching for ways of helping some of the area’s hardest hit communities. Building on an existing relationship–born out of a collaboration at the ceremony marking JetBlue’s new terminal opening at JFK–the airline contacted Belgian Waffle truck Wafels & Dinges, says JetBlue corporate communications manager Alison Croyle. “We reached out to them,” Croyle explains, “and from there it grew to us reaching out to the larger organization–to David Weber and the New York City Food Truck Association, many of whose members were happy and eager to step up and help out with this effort.” And how. The first day saw 11 trucks going to four locations in the Rockaways, Staten Island, and Hoboken. Over the next 96 harrowing hours, JetBlue sponsored the distribution of 25,000 meals by 20 trucks throughout the region. As the benefits, and tasty meals, of using food trucks for relief became apparent, others joined in–Chase Bank has been underwriting the KorillaBBQ Truck’s efforts and the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City has also donated cash to keep these trucks where they’re needed most. A pair of further fundraising efforts on Indiegogo has netted nearly $50,000 more. (You can find out which trucks are where through the NYC Food Truck Association’s Twitter feed, here, or by calling 311.) The good news, though, doesn’t stop with those receiving the food. Like many other local businesses, these trucks suffered crippling losses in the aftermath of Sandy. Much of Lower Manhattan’s Financial District was darkened by power outages, which scattered many workers and food truck customers far afield. The chance to claw back some of that lost revenue, to do well by doing good, is appreciated, not just by those receiving the food, but also those making it. Taking a short break to refill the generator of the KorillaBBQ Truck (the only electricity in his life, since his apartment is still without power), truck manager Brian Park looks tired but happy. “We wanted to get out here as fast as we could. Finding fuel hasn’t been easy. The truck is diesel, the generator is gas. It’s still difficult. Then we come out here where we’ve been serving up to 900 people a day. “ Beverley, a home health aide who asked that we not use her last name, sits on a parking barrier next to the Korilla Truck eating one of their signature Korean BBQ tacos–her first. Soon she’ll be carting bottles of water back up the seemingly endless flights of stairs to her apartment, which hasn’t had power, water, or heat for the last week, and probably won’t for another. “I’m one of the lucky people,” Beverly says. “I didn’t lose everything. I didn’t lose my life. I watched the storm that night–watched the water from the ocean come up and flow past my apartment building until it kissed the water from the bay. I still see the beauty of this area, but I also see the pain out here.” For a brief moment though, her worry seems to ebb: “These food trucks–these people are really fantastic. I’m a foodie, but I’ve never had this. The other day, there was a soul food truck, and there was one that gave us homemade donuts.” Before popping back into the truck to keep serving up tacos, Park says, “It feels good that we got to feed and help out all the people. Give them some good food and people get happy–get a little smile on their face.” Follow Matthew Kronsberg on Twitter.

# Regional news recap - Kimberley Daily Bulletin

A special avalanche warning has been issued for the weekend by Avalanche Canada. Most of the popular recreational terrain in the area is under this warning including the North Rockies, Cariboos, North and South Columbia, Glacier National Park, the Purcells, South Rockies and Lizard Range.  Backcountry users are warned that the lower elevation is actually more dangerous than the high alpine, and Avalanche Canada says anyone recreating in the backcountry should be equipped with essential rescue gear.  A 16-year-old Cranbrook youth has been arrested and hated with several firearms and drug offences, according to RCMP.  The youth remains in custody and is facing charges of uttering threats, possessing a weapon for dangerous purpose, trafficking and a breach of an Intensive Support and Supervision Order.  Three Indigenous bands in the East Kootenay are working with BC Housing to improve the quality of on-reserve homes.  The Shuswap Indian Band, Tobacco Plains Indian Band and the ʔaq̓am community will receive help from the housing crown corporation to maintain housing that meets industry standards for safety, durability, accessibility, healthy living and energy efficiency.  BC Housing will also provide training and education to strengthen expertise within each of the communities to manage housing supply.  The partnership is part of a three-year agreement through the Ktunaxa Shuswap Asset Management Initiative that includes funding support from the Columbia Basin Trust and Indigenous Services Canada.  A criminal investigation into the Fernie arena tragedy is ongoing, with no indication of a completion date.  The RCMP continues to examine the events of October 17, 2017 when three men tragically died after an ammonia leak at the Fernie Memorial Arena.  WorkSafeBC and Technical Safety BC concluded their investigations last year, making several recommendations to improve arena and workplace safety, however the RCMP have made no indication of when their investigation is expected to be completed.<|im_end|>

# Greater Noida storm destroys 150 houses, 1,000 rendered homeless

Greater Noida storm destroys 150 houses, 1,000 rendered homeless  The residents of the village, meanwhile, said they themselves started rescue operation soon after several residents were crushed underneath the piles of bricks. Dadri SDM says houses demolished were illegal, no compensation noida Updated: Feb 09, 2019 09:13 IST As many as 150 houses were destroyed and around 40 persons, including six children, were injured when a 30-second-long storm hit Alivardipur village near Hindon floodplains of Greater Noida on Thursday evening. The tempestuous storm, eyewitnesses said, rendered over 1,000 people homeless as their pucca homes were destroyed within seconds. Vineet Jaiswal, superintendent of police (rural), said, “Around 7.30pm on Thursday, we received information that a few houses along the Pushta Road in Alivardipur village have fallen down. Multiple teams of policemen, ambulances, and fire tenders were rushed to the spot. Initially, the police team found 10-12 injured people and rushed them to various hospitals in Noida and Greater Noida. The rest were taken to hospitals later.” Stating that those affected by the storm are not entitled to any compensation or rehabilitation, Dadri sub-divisional magistrate, Anjani Kumar, said, “The government can give compensation to those whose houses are legally made. All the houses which were demolished in the storm were built illegally and many of them were even new. We are in a dilemma regarding rehabilitation.” The residents of the village, meanwhile, said they themselves started rescue operation soon after several residents were crushed underneath the piles of bricks. Alimuddin, a 47-year-old daily wager, said, “I built by single-storeyed three-room house around 10 years ago. We were having supper in one of the rooms when we suddenly heard the winds gushing. Within seconds, bricks from our roof started falling on us. We somehow picked up our children, hugged them tight to save them.” “However, my daughter Yasmin and her husband Tawaraq Ali sustained head injuries while trying to shield their children. They have been admitted to the nearby NIMS Hospital, where doctors have called their conditions serious,” he added. Wasim Ahmad, a 22-year-old auto driver, said, “My father is handicapped and he cannot move from his bed on his own. When the storm came, he got trapped in a pile of bricks. I had to rush in and bring him out.” According to the residents, the cluster of houses which were demolished in the storm were built on both sides of Pushta Road over the last two decades. There are varied accounts regarding who owns the land, but many claimed that their village is called Purana (old) Alivardipur village. The residents of the village are mostly daily wage labourers. “Earlier, the entire Alivardipur village was on both sides of Pushta road. In 1977, there was a massive flood due to which more than half of the villagers had to relocate and the remaining villagers had to rebuild their houses at the same spot after few years. We call it Old Alivardipur village,” said Gaffar Ahmad (50), a differently abled man. First Published: Feb 09, 2019 08:55 IST<|im_end|>

# Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco cut fuel by up to 2p per litre in fresh supermarket petrol price war

ASDA has sparked another petrol price war with supermarkets announcing forthcoming unleaded and diesel price cuts.  The move will see unleaded prices drop by up to 1p a litre, while diesel prices will fall by up to 2p a litre.  Meanwhile, Sainsbury's will introduce the cuts at its 314 forecourts from Wednesday January 9. It takes Asda's national price cap to 113.7ppl on unleaded and 123.7ppl on diesel. The other supermarkets don't have a national cap.  Asda says it’s the seventh fuel price drop it's delivered since October 26, with unleaded falling by 14p a litre and diesel by 11p a litre.  Ways to cut down on your fuel costs HERE are some tips on how you can slash the cost of fuel  Make your car more fuel-efficient. You can do this by keeping your tyres inflated, taking the roof rack off, emptying your car of clutter and turning off your air con when driving at lower speeds. Find the cheapest fuel prices. PetrolPrices.com and Confused.com allows you to search prices of UK petrol stations. All you need to do is enter in your postcode and tell it how far you want to travel (up to 20 miles). Drive more efficiently. Some ways to do this, include: Accelerate gradually without over-revving Always drive on the highest possible gear If you can, allow your car to slow down naturally as your brake is a money burner Re-starting your car is expensive, if you can keep moving The supermarket says the move follows "continued decreases" in the wholesale cost - the price retailers pay for petrol.Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco came under fire last week after the RAC claimed they were "cheating" drivers out of cheaper fuel prices.  The motoring group accused the three supermarkets of failing to compete as closely on the price of unleaded as they usually do, which they said has added 3p a litre to the average fuel bill. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: “This cut is very welcome news, but the big question is whether the other supermarkets will respond and drop their prices sufficiently at all of their sites.  "Drivers badly need the supermarkets to start competing on price again as the so-called price war has been ‘cold’ since the middle of October.  "If this doesn’t happen then today’s Asda cut will not lower the average price of petrol and diesel across the country by as much as it should.  "This will mean drivers who are not near a low-cost fuel retailer will continue to pay over the odds.  "The price of petrol at the other supermarkets is currently about 3p more expensive than Asda compared to the normal gap of just over a penny so there is some catching up to do.”  Average unleaded prices now stand at 120.2p a litre, while diesel now stands at 129.5p a litre, according to price comparison website PetrolPrices.com.  The AA says average UK petrol prices have dropped to their lowest level since early April.  More on money Just last week furious MPs called for a fuel price watchdog to stop oil giants ripping off Brits.  Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, and Tesco engaged in a price war at the end of last year, with the supermarkets all lowering prices on more than one occasion.  Meanwhile, The Sun has helped motorists save £24BILLION over nine years by championing a fuel duty price freeze.  We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online Money team?

# AP Source: Reds Working To Complete Deal With LHP Zach Duke

CINCINNATI (AP) — The Cincinnati Reds are working to complete a deal with Zach Duke that would add the left-hander to their bullpen, a person familiar with the discussions told The Associated Press.  The person spoke on condition of anonymity Friday because the deal, first reported by The Athletic, was subject to a successful physical and has not been completed. The Reds have not commented.  Cincinnati overhauled its rotation and starting lineup in the offseason, trying to become a contender. The bullpen improved last season with the additions of Jared Hughes and David Hernandez to get to closer Raisel Iglesias, but it could use a left-hander.  Duke turns 36 in April. He pitched in 14 games for the Reds in 2013. Last season, he went 5-5 with a 4.15 ERA in 72 games with Minnesota and Seattle. Duke also has played for the Pirates, Diamondbacks, Nationals, Brewers, White Sox and Cardinals.  © 2019, The Village Reporter and/or The Associated Press. All rights reserved.<|im_end|>

# Imogen Heap’s Digital Gloves Let Her Sculpt Music Out Of Gestures

Let me see if I can write this post without referring to Minority Report — nope, not possible, since Imogen Heap’s musical gloves rely on the exact same idea as Tom Cruise’s image-remixing handgear. Having the gestural interface scheme applied to music, though, is a pretty neat live effect for a stage show — which Heap worked to great effect in a show at the TED conference in Edinburgh last month. Using gestures designed by her collaborator, Dr. Tom Mitchell of the University of West England at Bristol, Heap wove a digital melody out of thin air. Sadly TED hasn’t released video of the performance (“They only recorded in mono and we need stereo for the full effect,” Mitchell tells Co.Design), but it’s easy to visualize how the gloves work. Motion sensors, gyroscopes, and accelerometers track Heap’s hand and finger positions in real time, streaming the data to a laptop which interprets the gestures as specific commands that it then applies as audio processing. The gestures themselves are cheekily intuitive: To sample a sound, Heap literally makes a grasping motion as if plucking its aural essence; to filter or dampen a sound, she clasps her hands together as if muffling a squealing cell phone. Mitchell says that his system isn’t going to be available for anyone else but Heap anytime soon — it’s part of “a research project investigating methods for musical expression,” he told New Scientist. The rest of us working stiffs can make do with Toscanini, a scrappy open-sourced gestural interface device designed for dancers and musicians.<|im_end|>

# Parents of Kyle Fleischmann convinced he's buried under NoDa apartment complex

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — It’s one of Charlotte’s biggest mysteries. Eleven years later and we still don’t know what happened to Kyle Fleischmann. The 24-year-old vanished after a night out with friends in uptown. We traveled to Hilton Head to sit down with his parents and also talked to detectives in Charlotte. His parents seem convinced they know what happened. They fear he’s buried under an apartment complex that was under construction at the time.  But they are frustrated there is no way to prove it. All these years later, there’s no body, no great witnesses, no real evidence -- just a lot of questions and a heartbreak that never goes away. Barbara Fleischmann said time has helped to dull the pain after Kyle disappeared from uptown in November 2007 "It's true what they say about time," she said. "I like to think of the good things, think of the life, not the death. mostly the good things." Kyle's father, Dick, has a tougher time. "My brain tends to go towards, did we miss anything?" he said. Dick said it's harder for him to focus on the good because he was so involved -- and is still so involved -- in the search for answers. The outgoing, handsome Elon grad had been out with friends and ended the night at Buckhead Saloon. Cameras caught him walking on College Street towards 6th Street near Fuel Pizza. That was the last time anyone saw him. "What do you think happened?" we asked. "It’s a true missing persons case. We really don't know what happened," said Det. John Tuttle. It was closing time, and Kyle had left his wallet and coat at the bar. He’d made several calls to his best friend, his sister, and dad -- probably looking for a ride home. It was after 2 a.m. He didn’t reach anyone, and he didn’t leave any voicemails. "I just think he was a victim of robbery; it got bad, and they took his life," Dick said. Dogs tracked Kyle’s scent to NoDa, near where construction was just getting started on new condos. Eleven years ago, it was a neighborhood in transition.  "There's condos now. We tend to believe he’s buried under there. At the time there was open dirt because they were digging for the pipes," said Dick. Dick said searchers that day remembered a bad smell, and years later, people living there did as well. "Three years later, a woman contacted the police. She goes, well, I called the police, there was a horrible stench here, and I said there’s something deceased here.'" said Dick. Kyle’s parents have worked with a private investigator for years trying to get answers. "I think we know but it's never gonna be prosecuted or anything like that. We know what our PIs have found out and the police to a lesser extent but nothing provable," Barbara said The Facebook page Kyle’s friends set up in the early days of the search is still active. People often weigh in. Strangers are still fascinated by this case all these years later. "It resonates with people on so many different levels -- comes from a good family, college graduate, hard-working. He could be anybody; he’s the guy next door," said Det. Tuttle. Dick still makes a point to track the page and respond when he can. They have moved on, they say, as much as they can. "I hate to say it, it's hard to remember the sound of his voice, and sometimes it's hard it's not there but that’s the gift of time," Barbara said. "There's never a day I don’t think about him," said Dick. Barbara can't help but get wistful. "I wonder what he’d be doing. I see all of his friends getting married and having children, and I assume he would be doing that, too, and that would have been wonderful," she said. If you have any information on this case, call Crime Stoppers at 704-334-1600.<|im_end|>

# Northern Ireland team bus is icing on cake for taster day pupils

Over 700 pupils have attended a primary seven taster day at Carrickfergus Academy’s junior site.  Drawn from a number of schools in the East Antrim area, each group of visitors had the opportunity to go to three subject areas ranging from Art, HE, PE, Science to Music and Business Studies. Highlights of the day, Carrickfegus Acaemy reported, included getting to use the school’s trampolines, making pizzas in HE and all the experiments in Science. In Music, pupils were introduced to Samba music and were making their own rhythms and grooves. On the day, the winners of the school’s Open Night Competition were also revealed. Two pupils were the proud recipients of an ‘Amazon Echo Dot’ each: Brooke Dunlop from Victoria Primary and Samuel Sloan from Whitehead Primary. As a special treat Whitehouse Primary got to travel to the school in the Northern Ireland Football team’s bus. “Definitely a day to remember for our local primary school pupils,” Carrickfergus Academy concluded.<|im_end|>

# Ryan Sears could have big future with Shrewsbury – James Bolton

Advertising  Ryan Sears could have big future with Shrewsbury – James Bolton  Ryan Sears can have a big future in football if he believes in himself more, says fellow Shrewsbury defender James Bolton.  Academy graduate Sears, 20, was awarded Town’s man of the match for his performance from the bench as a first-half substitute in the FA Cup defeat at Wolves in midweek.  The youngster, from Newtown, is battling with first-teamer Bolton for a place on the right side of Sam Ricketts’ defence – though both players can also play as a centre-half.  Bolton, 24, says he sees a lot of himself in Sears and has called on the former AFC Telford loan man to grow in belief.  “It was unbelievable,” Bolton said of his team-mate’s performance against the Premier League side. “Sears is a good lad, a really good player.  “I see a bit of me in him. He doesn’t quite believe in himself, believe how good he is. I think he will have a good career and do well.  “Hopefully he keeps working hard and building on performances to get in the team.”  Sears has made two appearances in the league this season, including a full Town debut against today’s hosts Bristol Rovers in the September reverse fixture, where he kept Alex Rodman quiet.  “He knows what he’s got to do. He knows I’ll do anything for him if it comes down to it,” Bolton added.  Advertising  “On the pitch on Tuesday I was talking a lot to him, trying to put him at ease, he was doing really well. It’s all about talking and keeping him busy on the pitch. He knows what it’s all about.”  Meanwhile, boss Ricketts – a former right-back himself – hailed Bolton’s drive to improve as a key quality.  “He’s a solid person and player,” Ricketts said. “Every team needs players such as that, who you can rely on to give a steady performance every week.  “He really tries to develop and improve him all the time He comes in every day looking to improve. I love that.”  Advertising<|im_end|>

# Climate dominates local news and politics - 100 Mile House Free Press

This week the city of Halifax joined Vancouver in becoming the second Canadian city to declare a climate emergency. According to media covering the announcement, it’s largely to stress that climate change is real while considering how the municipality will make changes to its plans.  While it’s hard to say whether there will be any real benefit or detriment from such a proclamation, it is a good opportunity to take stock. In the South Cariboo local politics and news have been absolutely dominated by the issue (albeit somewhat indirectly at times). While the words “climate change” may not have gotten tossed around much, it’s hard to pick an issue that would even come close to the attention and effort that’s been spent in relation to forest fires. Now it’s difficult to say how much exactly of a contributing factor climate has played in the wildfires seen in B.C. in the past two years, and some have argued that forest management plays a major factor, but it’s hard to deny that in 2017 the months of June, July and August were exceptionally dry.  Furthermore, even just locally, there has been an abundance of presentations by experts warning residents that wildfires seasons such as the ones in 2017 and 2018 are the new normal. With one presentation ominously named the “Era of Megafires.”  For the past two weeks, a clearcut on a district-owned property has been front and centre. Now, the issue has been somewhat hotly contested but rarely if ever has the argument been presented that more fire protection isn’t needed. Usually, when government spends money on anything, it’s not long before some folks come forth complaining that government shouldn’t be spending money on whatever the issue at hand is.  A prime example was a $0.59 per $100,000 on the net taxable value of land and improvements for properties in Cariboo Regional District electoral areas G, H and L with funds going towards the cemetery in Nov. 2017. A number of people were vocally displeased with the tax despite it amounting to less than a cup of coffee for most people. That perspective has also always provided vocal opposition to both a pool or a rec centre expansion.  When it came to clearcutting a lot for fire protection this didn’t seem to be a prominent response. Obviously, it can be argued that the district is making money off of the logs and it’s hard to deny that. However, on Tuesday council decided to use hand treatment on part of the lot instead of clearcutting it. While there’s clearly still a cost associated with that, it’s hard to believe they would get the kind of revenue off of it that they would have had with a clearcut.  You can make up your own mind as to what you take away from that but it’s certainly interesting that cost has rarely been brought up (at least as far as the public goes).  If nothing else, you can probably expect climate-related issues (even if somewhat distant at times) to continue to dominate our local politics and news.<|im_end|>

# Idris Elba In Talks to Star in Max Landis Supernatural Thriller 'Deeper' (Exclusive)

10:36am PT by Borys Kit  Idris Elba In Talks to Star in Max Landis Supernatural Thriller 'Deeper' (Exclusive)  Idris Elba is going on a deep-sea dive.  The actor is in negotiations to star in the supernatural sci-fi thriller Deeper being made by MGM.  Baltasar Kormakur, the filmmaker behind survival dramas Everest and Adrift, is sitting behind the camera for the feature, which has a script written by Max Landis.  Deeper is supernatural thriller that centers on a disgraced astronaut, to be played by Elba, who is on a deep-sea dive exploring a newly discovered trench but soon finds himself confronted by a sinister and dangerous force. The tone has been described as being similar to recent hits Gravity and The Martian.  Elba’s casting brings the storied project one step closer to actually going in front of cameras. MGM paid seven figures to acquire the script in 20126 from the high-priced scribe Landis. The project also had Bradley Cooper and Gal Gadot attached to star and Kornel Mundruczo, the Hungarian director behind White God, attached to direct. However, one by one the players fell off and MGM was forced to decide whether to let it go or rebuild. It chose the latter.  David Goyer, Kevin Turen, Russell Ackerman, John Schoenfelder and Landis are producing the project. The heavily in-demand Elba is currently filming Working Title and Universal’s adaptation of Cats, in which he plays the feline Macavity. After having wrapped the villain role in Fast & Furious spinoff Hobbs & Shaw. Last year saw him appear in Avengers: Infinity War and topline another season of detective show Luther.  Elba is repped by WME and Hertz Lichtenstein.<|im_end|>

# Ariana Grande slams Grammys producer and accuses him of lying

Ariana Grande has released two successful albums within six months, announced a tour and broke streaming records with her hit singles "thank u, next" and "7 rings." But the pop star will not be performing at the Grammys, even though The show – or lack thereof – is causing some beef. Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich said the awards show had several conversations with Grande about performing on Sunday. Ehrlich said Grande "felt it was too late for her to pull something together," The Associated Press reported. Grande says he's lying. The singer fired back at Ehrlich's remarks on Thursday, tweeting: "i've kept my mouth shut but now you're lying about me." "i can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken," Grande wrote. "it was when my creativity & self expression was stifled by you, that i decided not to attend. i hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more." The singer did not stop there. "i offered 3 different songs," she revealed in a second tweet. "it's about collaboration. it's about feeling supported. it's about art and honesty. not politics. not doing favors or playing games. it's just a game y'all.. and i'm sorry but that's not what music is to me." "hope that helps everyone understand my decision. i am still grateful for the acknowledgement this year," she said in a third tweet. Ehrlich said the Recording Academy wanted Grande to perform at the Grammys after having "conversations over the past month or so," the AP reported. Variety reported that Grande pulled out of the Grammys due to disagreements over Grande seemed to confirm that in her tweets on Thursday. Grande's song "7 rings" debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, and, according to Nielsen Music, it also debuted at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart with 85.3 million U.S. streams in the week ending January 24. That's the second-biggest streaming week ever for a song by a female artist. The biggest week ever went to the album's title song, "thank u, next," which drew 93.8 million streams, Billboard reported. On Friday, Grande released her highly-anticipated album with the same name. The star had been teasing the February 8 release of on social media for weeks. The album dropped at midnight and fans lit up Twitter with their reactions.

# SEE IT: Bronx Food cart worker scares off armed mugger - NY Daily News

A feisty Bronx food cart worker scared off a mugger who held a gun to his head during a late-night robbery, police said Saturday.  Surveillance video shows a food worker try to grab a gun pointed at him as he sat in his cart on White Plains Road near E. 225th St. in Williamsbridge about 1:30 a.m. on Jan. 23, cops said.  Two men hung around out outside the cart, eyeing cash on the counter, before one of them ran in and aimed a gun at the vendor, authorities said.  The worker gets up as the suspect grabs his cash and backs away, the video shows. When the man tries to snatch the gun, the robber slams the cart door on him and runs away, police said.<|im_end|>

# Frog Design: 3 Things Wile E. Coyote Teaches Us About Creative Intelligence

Bruce Nussbaum was right to close the book on Design Thinking. It is time to move on. Business never really got the message. What businesses continue to care about is innovation. While designers may think that innovation requires Design Thinking, that was an idea that never really stuck in the executive suite. Is “creativity” any different? Most executives will acknowledge that innovation requires some form of creativity. But creativity brings its own baggage.  There’s a notion that you find out early in life whether you are creative.  Creativity is generally viewed as an inherent quality within a person; there’s a notion that you find out early in life whether you are creative or not. How many times have you heard a business person say “I am not creative” in a meeting? The concept of “Creative Intelligence” (or CQ) extends that model by implying that our level of creativity can be assessed in a quantitative manner similar to an IQ score. By bringing creativity into the sphere of assessment, I fear that CQ will ultimately suffer a similar fate as Design Thinking. Putting HR in the Driver’s Seat Why do I say that? Last fall, frog design had the opportunity to participate in the Economist ‘Ideas Economy’ conference on Human Potential in New York and I was able to observe firsthand, the dangers of this model of creativity. While the conference had the usual provocative speakers (Clay Shirky, Dan Pink, Dan Ariely) the audience leaned heavily toward HR executives. The underlying message coming from Richard Florida, Vijay Vaitheeswaran, and others is that creativity should be viewed as a critical resource that is undervalued within most organizations and thus, represents a huge area for growth in the 21st century (hence the “Human Potential” referred to in the title). The corollary to that message was that HR should play a lead role in building and managing this resource like any other link in the corporate value chain. Again and again speakers fell into the trap of referring to “creativity” as a form of organizational capital just like finances, real estate, or energy. I found this very disturbing. And I worry that the concept of CQ will only play into HR’s hands. Misconceptions about Creativity The frog team spent two days injecting a series of games into the conference to inspire collaboration among participants and to challenge this assumption. In the closing session, I had the opportunity to reveal the key message behind these activities and reframe the notion of creativity and human potential. To make my point, I used one of my favorite representations of creativity and human potential in popular culture: Wile E. Coyote. So, what exactly does a cartoon character teach us about creativity? 1. Creativity is BETWEEN Us (Not Within Us) You would probably argue that Wile E.’s CQ is much higher than Road Runner. In fact, he probably generates more inventions per broadcast minute than any other character in popular culture. While Road Runner just, well, runs away. But would Wile E. be anywhere near as creative without Road Runner? Would his inventions emerge out of his own faculties unprompted or only in response to a situation? His relationship with Road Runner is a dynamic that constantly pushes him farther, faster, and (unfortunately in most cases) higher than he imagined.  Would Wile E. be anywhere near as creative without Road Runner?  The reality is that we can’t just assess and hire people with high CQs and expect them to do their creative magic. Creativity emerges out of relationships; it’s the tension between different ideas and perspectives and so it is risky to define it as an ability that we inherently possess. Wile E.’s inventions always fail because he has no one to collaborate with, only Road Runner to inspire them. And all Road Runner ever does is beep beep and zoom off. 2. Creativity Must be Externalized Creativity is driven by the ability to externalize ideas in a wide variety of forms. Wile E. is the best rapid-prototyper in the history of popular culture. He can wire, weld, hammer, drill, and solder almost anything. This implies a wide variety of intelligences at work in Wile E.’s brain–after all, some of the best ideas emerge when we pair artists and engineers, scientists and strategists.  The key to true creativity is having many types of intelligence at the table.  This is one of the true universal insights of the design process. We should be careful not to assume that there is one form of “Creative Intelligence.” I am afraid that any practical measurement of CQ will, by definition, narrow this range. The key to true creativity is to ensure that multiple forms of intelligence are at the table (including the most analytic and least “creative?) and that they are externalized and synthesized in an active manner. After all, how does Road Runner always manage to be in the right place at the right time” He might possess a different type of intelligence than Wile E., but one that is equally wily. 3. Creativity is Driven by Social Dynamics Creativity is the result of a set of relationships with strong social and emotional dimensions. It comes out of a collaborative environment (and this is where HR can play a meaningful role), hence the shift in focus toward organizational culture and transformation in design organizations. Wile E. Coyote has evolved in an environment that is truly barren. This condition is heightened by the beautiful, but stagnant backdrops that frame his frenetic activity. The canyons and mesas seem truly oblivious to his existential plight. The only other creature in his world, sadly, is Road Runner, the object of his every affection and desire. Road Runner is the only possibility for collaboration with Wile E. Coyote, for both connection and meaning. How can we ever be creative without feeling this human connection and without being able to bounce our ideas off of each other? The heartbreaking thing about the show is not that Wile E. never gets his meal. It is that his efforts are never acknowledged by Road Runner at all. The best he can do is look knowingly out at the camera–out at us–hoping for some sympathy before he falls (and falls and falls) to the empty desert floor. Group Intelligence Clearly I am a huge fan of Road Runner and empathize with Wile E. Doesn’t everyone? But I have found that Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote are a very accessible metaphor for communicating some important dimensions of creativity that are often lost on the business community. In the end, I fear that people are going to read about Creative Intelligence and believe that all that they need to do is identify and hire for a high level of CQ and their business will become more ?creative,” instead of building an environment and culture that is truly open and collaborative.  Design teaches us that creativity is not an innate ability.  I have seen over and over again how a multi-disciplinary environment that recognizes many forms of intelligence and brings them together in a collaborative manner leads to true Creative Intelligence. This type of dynamic is critical to the design process. And yes, some people are especially talented at facilitating these kinds of interactions (whether they are designers, teachers, activists, or advocates). Is this a sign of Creative Intelligence, empathy, or Emotional Intelligence (EQ)? As Greg Aper put it in his insightful comments to Bruce’s post, “Trying to separate a social ability from the psychology of the individual is not a task I would relish.” Design teaches us that creativity is not an innate ability–it is the end result of many forms of intelligence coming together, and intelligence born out of collaboration and out of networks. Perhaps true CQ resides in the group and the community, and not the individual. Now, how are we going to measure that?<|im_end|>

# Armenia Sends Deminers To Syria As Part Of Russia-Backed Mission

The Armenian Defense Ministry says Yerevan has sent a team of demining experts and other personnel to war-ravaged Syria as part of a Russia-backed mission.  Ministry spokesman Artsrun Hovhannisian said a team of 83 mine-clearing sappers, medical personnel, and security officers arrived on February 8 and will focus on the city of Aleppo, in northern Syria.  He stressed that the personnel will not be involved in the fighting taking place in the Middle East country. Syria’s seven-year civil war has left more than 400,000 people dead, displaced millions, and devastated many historic sites across the country.  “Armenian specialists will carry out humanitarian activities related to humanitarian demining, mine awareness of the population, provision of medical assistance in Aleppo, exclusively outside the zone of combat operations,” Hovhannisian wrote on Facebook.  More than 100,000 ethnic Armenians lived in Aleppo prior to the war. Many have fled, including thousands to Armenia.  Syrian government forces regained control of Aleppo in December 2016 after a long, devastating campaign of siege and bombardment against rebels, who had held the eastern side of the ancient city for more than four years.  The Syrian conflict began with a government crackdown on protesters in March 2011. Russia and Iran have given crucial support to President Bashar al-Assad, while the United States and Turkey have backed differing antigovernment fighters.  Russia will transport the Armenian team to Syria and provide logistical support, Hovhannisian said.  Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on February 8 thanked his Armenian counterpart, Defense Ministry Davit Tonoian, for deploying the personnel to Syria.  "You were the first to respond to our call to provide assistance to the Syrian people," he said.  Some Armenian politicians, however, criticized the move, with the Sasna Tsrer All-Armenian Party warning that too close military ties with Russia in Syria could hurt Armenia's interests and undermine its security.  Yerevan has traditionally had close ties with Moscow, and the Russian military has a base in Armenia.  But with the ouster of pro-Russia Armenian leader Serzh Sarkisian and the assumption of power of former opposition leader Nikol Pashinian, some questions have arisen of Yerevan’s commitment to Moscow.  Pashinian has vowed to retain good relations with Russia, but he has also spoken of desires toincrease the South Caucasus nation’s ties with the United States and Europe.  Yerevan has also contributed personnel to U.S.-backed missions in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.  With reporting by RFE/RL's Armenian Service, AP, and Interfax<|im_end|>

# This 3D-Printed Part Helps Ken Block's Hoonitruck Make 900 Tire-Destroying Horsepower

This 3D-Printed Part Helps Ken Block's Hoonitruck Make 900 Tire-Destroying Horsepower 3D printing isn't a novelty anymore—as shown here, it's capable of making world-class performance parts for race engines. Of all the vehicles featured in Ken Block's Gymkhana 10, his 900-horsepower Hoonitruck is arguably the most high-tech. Alongside all the complex electronics required to run the high-powered engine and all-wheel-drive system, it features the single largest 3D printed metal component ever fitted to a wheeled vehicle. In order to make the 900-plus horsepower necessary for all that tire smoke, a twin-turbo, 3.5-liter V-6 of the same spec as that found in the Ford GT supercar was dropped into the 1977 F-150, but its base power of 647 horsepower wasn't quite enough to do the job. The solution—more boost—is simple on paper, but required an intake manifold capable of withstanding the greater pressures associated with cramming extra air into the engine. Ford Performance's answer to the quandary was to contract the Digital Additive Production Institute of German technical college RWTH Aachen, which advised the automaker on how to turn its conceptual manifold into a reality using additive manufacturing—known better as 3D printing. Though it takes time, additive manufacturing is typically less wasteful than machining and capable of more intricacy than casting. By gradually adding aluminum over a period of five days, layer by tiny layer, Ford built up the complex, six-kilogram (13.2-pound) part, which juts up from the Hoonitruck's low hood, the crown jewel of the engine. "I think Ford did an exceptional job," Block said of the manifold. "This is my favorite part of the Hoonitruck. You could not have made it any other way." "We are fortunate to have access to incredible technology, but this was one project that pushed us—and our computing power—to the absolute limit," added Advanced Materials and Processes Engineer Raphael Koch, from Ford of Europe. "The manifold has a complex web‑like structure that couldn't be made using traditional manufacturing methods. We ended up dissolving the support systems in acid." Automakers and aftermarket suppliers alike are turning to 3D printing for more parts as the technology matures. General Motors is readying a handful of cutting-edge components manufactured using 3D printing for use in low-volume vehicle applications, while wheel manufacturer HRE has demonstrated that additive manufacturing can be used to create elaborately designed titanium wheels for use on exotic cars. At this rate, it may not be long before 3D printed parts appear in your next commuter.

# Anne Arundel polystyrene bill poised to pass with Democrat controlled council, executive office

Anne Arundel County was one vote away in 2018 from banning polystyrene containers, commonly used as takeout containers and lunch trays in public schools. Democrats pressed the issue as an environmental decision to protect local waterways and the Chesapeake Bay. With a Democratic controlled council and county executive office, the container ban has little standing in the way of its passage in 2019. “I support that bill,” Pittman said. “We will not veto that bill.” While supporters tout the environmental benefits, businesses and the county’s school system are wary of the costs associated with switching to more eco-friendly alternatives.  Democrats passed the 2018 bill because of support from Councilman John Grasso. The Glen Burnie Republican backed the bill as an environmentally friendly decision. Grasso was term-limited on the council and unsuccessfully ran for Maryland senate. Then County Executive Steve Schuh vetoed the bill and called it a tax on county businesses. The council couldn’t muster an additional vote to overturn the veto. The legislation would ban polystyrene containers typically used by restaurants and businesses for take-out food. If approved businesses that use the containers would have until January 2020 to find alternatives.With four Democratic cosponsors and a supportive county executive, the bill seems primed for passage. Environmental advocates argue the containers are harmful to the environment because they don’t completely break down. This means fish and wildlife can eat the plastic as it floats into creeks and streams, they said at the previous hearing on the 2018 legislation. Maryland lawmakers are considering a state ban to the containers. If the state ban is passed, the state law would supersede a local ban. “It is the kind of thing we need to move away from,” said Lisa Rodvien, D-Annapolis, who sponsored the legislation. “This is the first step in becoming an environmentally friendly community.” Opponents to the bill said the environmental impact was overblown during the public hearing on the 2018 bill. There is no federal ban on the containers and they are approved for food use. They argued the bill also unfairly burdened local businesses in a county that has a recycling center for the polystyrene containers. The Restaurant Association of Maryland opposes the county and state legislation. Some Maryland restaurants stopped using polystyrene on their own while others prefer the cheaper containers. “It is poor public policy to force businesses to use more expensive alternatives that will largely end up in the same landfill or incinerator as the PS foam products currently used,” wrote Melvin Thompson, senior vice president of the association. “Food service packaging decisions should be left to business owners based on their specific needs and price they can afford.” A surprising opponent to the previous bill was the Anne Arundel County Public School system. School officials said they opposed the bill because the council did not assign any funding to pay for the school’s transition from plastic to paper containers. School chief operating officer Alex Szachnowicz said this week the school’s position is “agnostic” when it comes to changing trays but they do want money to make the shift. The school system serves about 9.6 million breakfast and lunches a year. The current trays cost about 3 cents each; alternatives are priced at 6, 8 and 10 cents, depending on the type and quality, Szachnowicz said. It will cost between $290,000 to $676,000 to change the type of tray based on the price of the replacement. The school system would prefer using the 8 or 10 cent trays. The schools could raise the price of lunches to pay for the trays, but they can only do so for students that don’t qualify for free and reduced meals. That’s about 68 percent of the population, Szachnowicz said. “The net increase cost will be disproportionately born by the 68 percent,” Szachnowicz said. “We don’t think it is fair.” Pittman said he would look favorably upon the school system requesting the necessary funds in upcoming budget requests.<|im_end|>

# Wall & Main: Kinetic Batteries on the move in the heart of Massachusetts

WPI Ph.D. candidate Aaron Birt is making progress on his local battery startup, Kinetic Batteries. I would be delighted to see more WPI-led companies start and grow in Worcester. Kinetic Batteries is Mr. Birt’s second startup. The first was EventTree, a service intended to connect Worcester residents, students and visitors with local community activities. Mr. Birt left EventTree in 2015 and started Kinetic Batteries in 2016. As he said in an April 2018 interview, “In 2015 I had to make a tough choice: EventTree or my Ph.D. I learned after a year of trying to do both that the technology spaces were too different. I needed to focus on one or the other. We had built a fully functional prototype (very slick if I do say so myself), but I elected to focus on my Ph.D. because I saw some fantastic opportunities with the research team at WPI and my co-founder didn’t want to press forward without me, so we shut it down.” Kinetic Batteries makes batteries better and less costly to manufacture. As he explained, “Kinetic Batteries was officially started in December 2016. We had been doing the background research and experiments for about a year before that. Battery manufacturing is old tech. The markets today are demanding lower prices to encourage greater adoption. We saw an opportunity to leverage a manufacturing technology that we were researching to simultaneously improve battery performance and decrease manufacturing costs,” he said. Last April, Kinetic Batteries had not generated revenue, but principals expect to begin doing so “between the third quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020.” Mr. Birt also had a specific short-term goal and a plan to achieve it. As he said, in 2018 we want to “Go to pilot scale. The first step for this is to use the [$65,000] we raised from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center Catalyst Award to demonstrate how our batteries perform relative to those available on the market today. Once we have this information in hand, we can begin to focus on raising funds, designing the pilot line, identifying any major technology hurdles, and bringing on additional talent to support this expansion.” On Feb. 4, I interviewed Mr. Birt to find out how the company is progressing and learned that Kinetic Batteries had participated in Boston startup incubator, MassChallenge. “We had an incredible summer/fall participating in MassChallenge. We met a lot of exciting startups and entrepreneurs, but most importantly met several top-notch mentors and advisors who really helped us shape our business model. From a technical standpoint, we just finished building out our own fabrication line, which is enabling us to prototype much more quickly,” he said. Kinetic Batteries is working with early-adopter customers offering them considerable benefits. “We are engaging in initial discussions with several customers interested in using our 3D printed batteries. The batteries we are producing can be printed in any geometry. This allows product designers to design with the battery instead of around the battery as is done traditionally. Moreover, the process that we use doesn’t require toxic solvents or expensive post-processing steps; we’re able to directly print the battery materials where they’re needed,” Mr. Birt said. He did not provide specific details on when Kinetic Batteries will begin to generate sales, but it is certainly trying. “We are actively engaged with a number of customers and investors. We have a few key milestones that we are looking to hit in the very near future. The focus for us is on delivering on these technical milestones. We are constantly leveraging our networks from MassChallenge and the Tech Advisors Network to continue connecting with as many potential customers and partners as possible in order to continue refining both the product and the business model,” he said. Kinetic Batteries will focus this year on meeting technical and production targets so it can raise capital. As he explained, “First, we plan to finalize several technical milestones for production of both liquid-electrolyte and solid-electrolyte lithium ion batteries. This will put us in a perfect position to raise capital and accelerate our growth. We have all the pieces in place right now, we are just taking the time to put them together. "Second, upon demonstrating all the technical metrics that we have established we will look to raise capital either through government contracts or private capital. This will put us in a position near the end of 2019 to complete our functioning pilot-scale production line. This pilot line then will allow us to further de-risk our technology and begin selling prototype custom batteries to key customers,” Mr. Birt said. “Access to talent, reasonably-priced space, and a growing ecosystem for entrepreneurs,” all make Worcester the right place for Kinetic Batteries. According to Mr. Birt, “Being an entrepreneur in Worcester means that your company is always breaking new ground. People are excited about who you are and what you do, and in turn we are excited to be helping to grow the ecosystem here.” Worcester is a friendlier place for entrepreneurs. As he said, “In Boston, you are much more of a ‘number.’ The biggest challenge to being in Worcester is the sense from folks in the Boston startup ecosystem that we are too far away. Worcester is an hour away, and having spent a great deal of time traveling around Boston I can tell you that it takes longer to get from one meeting in Boston to another than it does to travel from Boston to Worcester.” Peter Cohan of Marlboro heads a management consulting and venture capital firm, and teaches business strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College.

# Jeff Jacobs: Departure of Connecticut Open means we lose a piece of the big time

Anne Worcester did everything she could the past few years to save a tournament that hung like a tennis ball on the net cord.  With staunch determination and the most pleasant of dispositions, Worcester convinced sponsors and the world’s greatest players alike to come to New Haven one week before the U.S. Open. For 21 years, Connecticut’s Happy Tennis Warrior sold a visit to a sponsor’s beer tent or a downtown restaurant with the same gusto as she sold Caroline Wozniacki or Petra Kvitova.  The Connecticut Open tournament director did all this against increasing odds and eventually, without a title sponsor, against all odds. And with the announcement Friday morning that The Tennis Foundation of Connecticut had sold its Premier WTA Sanction to a group that will move the tournament to Zhengzhou City, China, Worcester admitted it was an emotional day.  “I have 65 unread text messages, all kinds of social media alerts, 19 voice mails and this is the 10th media interview today,” Worcester said at 4 p.m. “I guess I’ve been so in the weeds on finding a title sponsor and cultivating bidders that I didn’t even take a moment to think about the response: It has been beautiful.  “It has been an amazing 21-year run.”  Yes, it has.  And that is why Friday was a sad day for New Haven and Connecticut sports.  We lost a piece of the big time.  The tournament was saved from moving to Winston-Salem, N.C., in 2013 when the state stepped in and bought the sanction for $618,000. Without a corporate white knight this time, it was game, set, match, China.  “It has gotten increasingly expensive to run a world-class WTA event in this expensive facility,” Worcester said. “Costs keep going up, prize money keeps going up. In this day and age, where you can sit on your sofa and watch Hulu or Netflix, and everything from your smartphone, it’s harder to sell tickets to live events.  “The only thing that would have made the financial model viable would be a generous title sponsor.”  Sponsorships already covered 75 percent of operating expense. Yet without a title sponsor carrying, oh, a $1.5 million freight, it would be untenable. The Connecticut Open cobbled together cornerstone-level sponsors and a one-time loan from the USTA for 2018. But, already, the Chinese event will bump the prize money from $800,000 to $1 million in 2019 and $1.5 million in 2020.  “When you compare the Connecticut Open to the other WTA Premier 700 events, our revenues are near or at the top, but our expenses are extraordinary,” Worcester said. “If not for Pilot Pen, Yale, Yale-New Haven Health, the state and city of New Haven, we wouldn’t have had this amazing run.  “We talked to 88 companies in four months, came close with a handful, but did not get a commitment. We had to cut bait, tell the WTA whether we’d stay or sell and start this global bidding process that took many months and concluded (Thursday).” Read Full Article There is great power with a title sponsor, one fully invested, creative, dedicated to the full experience and with deep, deep pockets. Once given up for dead, the state’s PGA Tour tournament has become a premier June stop. The Travelers Championship has won the Players Choice award the past two years, essentially the golfers’ favorite place to play on tour.  “Whenever I have heart-to-hearts with (tournament director) Nathan Grube, he says we would not be alive if not for Travelers,” Worcester said.  Brooks Koepka and Justin Thomas, two of the world’s top four-ranked players, recently committed five months before the 2019 event. That’s unusual and, well, thank the golf gods for Travelers. There also was a time when there wasn’t much of an interest gap between golf at Cromwell and tennis in New Haven. Those were the days of John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl, Boris Becker, Andre Agassi. Those were the early days of 11,000 fans at the Connecticut Tennis Center.  Opened in 1991, former Gov. Lowell Weicker’s $18 million baby, the center’s second deck became an unneeded appendage. That didn’t mean tennis couldn’t survive and that the site still can’t be used for everything from office space to a dressing room for visiting Ivy League football teams. Yet as attendance slid it became obvious the place was built way too big.  The men left, came back and left again. Steffi Graf won right away after the WTA arrived. Lindsay Davenport won twice. Venus Williams won four times. There was a magical night when Venus played Jennifer Capriati and 11,500 fans showed. Those names rolled easily off sports fans’ tongues. Women’s tennis was big.  Yes, Caroline Wozniacki won four times in a row and Kvitova three times. Yet the hard truth — Worcester has said this — you could have five of the top 10 players in the world committed now and people would say they never heard of them. Travelers can draw 300,000 without Tiger Woods. Without Serena Williams, who doesn’t play the week before the U.S. Open, the Connecticut Open had to try everything humanly possible — from food trucks to selfies with the players — to attract 50,000. It didn’t help this past August when fatigued No. 1-ranked player Simona Halep withdrew and a slew of early exits decimated the best field in a dozen years.  “We have been surprisingly lucky in attracting top players, but the twist is women’s tennis is no longer on a first-name basis with the world like in the 1990s and early 2000s,” Worcester said. “Venus, Monica, Lindsay, Jennifer. You just can’t say that anymore. I love today’s players. I’m proud we have been a launching pad for the stars of tomorrow. But you can’t sell most of those names to the American public.”  With the sale, the state will get its investment back, and with limited resources Worcester listed options for The Foundation. There’s women’s and men’s challenger events. There’s Invesco Series men’s legends. There’s World Team Tennis, Fed Cup, Davis Cup or Roger Federer’s Match For Africa.  With some discussions already held, the front-runner is the Oracle Challenger series for men and women, with $300,000 combined prize money. It could include an Invesco legends event that has been held at the Connecticut Open the past few years. Worcester said there was a meeting with Gov. Ned Lamont the other day to thank the state for its support. She said Lamont is a fan of the men’s legends. James Blake, McEnroe, it’s good stuff. But the best women? They’re gone.  When she took on the job in 1998, after four years as head of the WTA, Worcester had a newborn girl and a 2-year-old boy. She said the new job gave her some flexibility. She used that flexibility to become the greatest friend to New Haven and state tennis. The tournament, she said, became her third child.  “I’m going to explore the next chapter of my life,” Worcester said. “I haven’t had much time to think about it. I’ll stay with The Foundation board to try to help with replacing the pro event. More than likely it will not be day-to-day. I still have an ongoing role with Market New Haven.”  Nobody has done a better job of marketing New Haven than Anne Worcester.  That stands even as her third child heads to China.  jeff.jacobs@hearstmediact.com; @jeffjacobs123<|im_end|>

# What inspectors said was good and bad about Highfield after its 'inadequate' Ofsted inspection

A 13-page report into Highfield Leadership Academy outlined a number of areas where improvement is needed, and where inspectors from Osted were impressed.  The education watchdog has placed the school, in Highfield Road, South Shore, in special measures and said improvement is needed immediately. Summary of the key findings for parents and pupils (all from Ofsted's report, which is due out on Friday) * Pupils make inadequate progress in many subjects. Leaders, including trustees and governors, have been unable to improve the school quickly enough. As a result, the quality of education falls far short of being acceptable. * Leaders and trust representatives have an overgenerous view of the school's effectiveness. * Arrangements to safeguard pupils are ineffective. Some pupils do not feel safe. * Many pupils report their teachers do not tackle bullying effectively. Some pupils report they witness homophobic discrimination. * The use of offensive language by pupils in the corridor is commonplace. Some pupils show a lack of respect for each other and staff. * Pupils' behaviour disrupts learning. Disruption from some pupils mean many classrooms are disorderly. Some pupils ignore instructions from staff. * Temporary staff do not receive adequate help to plan learning or manage pupils' behaviour effectively. * Despite teachers' efforts, much time during learning is not used effectively. Many pupils do not focus well on their learning. * Many teachers do not use assessment information effectively to plan learning. * Some teachers have low expectations of pupils' behaviour. They do not use the school's systems effectively to challenge pupils' poor behaviour. * Some pupils have gaps in their learning. They do not have sufficient knowledge to make the progress of which they are capable. * Pupils' progress at key stage is among the worst in the country. Pupils have underachieved significantly in most subjects, including English and mathematics. * Provisional information for 2018 shows the progress made by disadvantaged pupils, the most able pupils, and boys, is exceptionally poor. Pupils with special education needs and/or disabilities (SEND) also underachieve. * Some pupils expressed concerns about the negative effect that leaders' recent changes to the curriculum will have on their choices when they leave the school. * Although pupils' attendance has improved, almost one quarter of disadvantaged pupils continue to be absent from school regularly. * Many pupils arrive at school late. Also, many pupils do not arrive punctually at their lessons. The school was found to have the following strengths: * Leaders and trust representatives have a strong sense of moral purpose. They have faced substantial obstacles and have worked tenaciously to overcome these. * Many pupils at the school want to do well and they are polite and friendly.<|im_end|>

# Ariana Grande apologizes to fans for not going to the Grammys despite winning for best pop vocal album

source Mike Coppola/Getty Images for Billboard   Ariana Grande won best pop vocal album at the 2019 Grammys Sunday. Grande won’t be at the ceremony. The singer pulled out of performing at the 61st annual show after she said her “creativity & self expression was stifled” by the Grammys. The singer took to Twitter to accept her award, thanking her fans for being her “main source of joy and inspiration” and apologizing to them for not being at the show. Ariana Grande may not be at the 2019 Grammys at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Sunday, but she’s still going home a winner. The 25-year-old singer won the award for best pop vocal album for “Sweetener,” beating out fellow nominees Pink, Shawn Mendes, Taylor Swift, Kelly Clarkson, and Camila Cabello.  Surprised by her win, Grande shared a string of tweets both thanking and apologizing to fans for not being at the ceremony Sunday night. “F—,” tweeted Grande. “I know I’m not there tonight (trust, I tried and still truly wished it had worked out tbh) and I know I said I try not to put too much weight into these things … but f— … this is wild and beautiful. Thank you so much.”  “But mostly thank y’all for being my main source of joy and inspiration always,” Grande added.    i know i’m not there tonight (trust, i tried and still truly wished it had worked out tbh) and i know i said i try not to put too much weight into these things …. but fuck ……. ???? this is wild and beautiful. thank you so much.  — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) February 10, 2019  but mostly thank y’all for being my main source of joy and inspiration always  — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) February 10, 2019 Grande was originally scheduled to perform at the 61st annual show, but recently pulled out of appearing at the Grammys and attending the event. According to Variety, the singer felt “insulted” she was not allowed to perform her new song “7 Rings,” and instead perform a medley of songs.  Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich told the Associated Press on Thursday that it “felt it was too late for her to pull something together.”  Grande denied that was the case, saying on Twitter that Ehrlich was lying.  “I’ve kept my mouth shut but now you’re lying about me,” Grande wrote. “I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken. It was when my creativity & self expression was stifled by you, that I decided not to attend.”  “I offered 3 different songs. It’s about collaboration. It’s about feeling supported,” Grande continued in another tweet. “It’s about art and honesty. Not politics. Not doing favors or playing games. It’s just a game y’all.. and I’m sorry but that’s not what music is to me.”  Grande’s win comes the weekend she released her fifth studio album, “Thank U, Next,” the second one she released in the past year. Grande was also nominated for best pop solo performance for “God Is a Woman.” That award went to Lady Gaga for her song “Joanne.”  You can keep up with all of the Grammys winners here.

# Chrissy Teigen Gets Real About How Hard Parenting Can Be After Her "Toughest" Day with Daughter Luna

Chrissy Teigen is known for a) ruthlessly roasting her husband John Legend and b) always keeping it real—remember when she shared that she got butt hives on vacation? Or when she opened up about the fight that she had with John at Kim Kardashian's wedding? And it looks like parenting is no exception. Last night, Chrissy posted an Instagram story telling her followers all about how life with her adorable kids, two-year-old Luna and baby Miles, isn't always as picture perfect as it seems.  After Instagramming videos of her mom making delicious-looking egg rolls all day, a very exasperated-sounding Chrissy posted a story saying, "Update: She did not eat a single bite. Today might have been in my top...one days of toughest days with Luna. For everyone that's like 'omg my ovaries are exploding when I see your kids, omg so cute I need a baby right now!' We don't instagram everything, okay? We don't."  Oof, doesn't sound fun! But props to Chrissy for opening up about her personal life so that followers can see that even with all the fame and riches, parenting is still hard as hell.<|im_end|>

# Ask the psychologist: How die-hard fans can cope with intense emotions over the Super Bowl

SportsPulse: Our experts predict the one key that's going to make or break the game and who will be holding the Lombardi Trophy in the end. USA TODAY New England Patriots fans have been here before. Nine times in the past 18 years, to be exact. That doesn't make it any less stressful. Being a die-hard sports fan has its ups and downs, and for many, those downs can end up ruining an experience which, by its very nature, is supposed to be enjoyed. As Sunday's Super Bowl LIII between the Patriots and Los Angeles Rams approaches, USA TODAY Sports spoke with Dr. Gerald Reid, a psychologist based in Boston who specializes in anxiety and works with athletes. Reid discussed how fans can cope with the roller-coaster ride of emotions that come with the big game. Before the game - Be active. Get some exercise. - Try to look at the big picture of the team's journey. Appreciate the sport — particularly the skills and traits that got the players here — rather than obsessing over what the outcome of the game may be. "Anything with anxiety, if you can step back and see the big picture of what's happening, it really puts things into perspective and calms you down," Reid says. - Think ahead. Plan something relaxing to do after the game to wind down. YOUR DAILY DOSE: Top sports headlines, delivered daily During the game - Instead of obsessing over whether your team is going to win or lose, which fuels anxiety because you can't control the outcome, slow your mind to be more present. Observe each moment as it plays out. - Label what you're experiencing. "If you're not acknowledging what you're feeling, you're held captive by it and it takes over," Reid says. "Let go of this feeling that you can control what's happening (in the game) and allow yourself to say, 'I'm in awe of what's happening.' " - Try to re-frame what you're feeling. Tell yourself, "I'm so excited" rather than, "I'm so stressed." - Take a deep breath and focus on the commercials. Or walk away during the commercials to do something else if you need to reset your mind. If you're at the game, take in the atmosphere. - Catch yourself when your thinking becomes too obsessive or your body becomes too tense. Sometimes just noticing it can help you relax. - Limit your alcohol intake. "If there's anxiety involved, anxiety can turn into anger if it's not regulated well, especially if there's a loss," Reid says. "The emotional reactions could be hard to control and much more strong, and they may do something that they regret." After the game If your team loses... - Grieve with other fans, whether on social media, by phone or in person. "It's almost like (fans) are part of a family," Reid says. " ... If you're part of a family, what you do as a family is you grieve together. ... You come together, you reminisce about the good times, allow yourself to grieve the pain of the loss. That's what meaningful relationships are about. It's not just being excited and feeling confident about the wins." - Give it time. - Redirect your energy into other projects and adjust back into a routine. - Be physically active. If your team wins... - Spread your joy. Follow USA TODAY Sports' AJ Neuharth-Keusch on Twitter.<|im_end|>

# Apple’s Mac App Store Opens January 6th

We wondered last year if the iTunes iOS App Store’s success would prompt Apple to do something similar for software on its iconic Mac computers, and recently we were proved right when Steve Jobs revealed the upcoming Mac Store. Apple’s now revealed that the Mac App 
Store will open its doors to consumers on January 6th in numerous 
nations around the world. The press release notes the store will feature “paid and free apps in categories like Education, Games, Graphics and Design, Lifestyle, Productivity and Utilities.” This is interesting right off the bat–Apple’s playing up to markets that it’s traditionally strong in, like teaching and design, but it’s also pushing gaming and lifestyle apps in the mix–highlighting how Macs are now part of many people’s home life. Steve Jobs himself is quoted as saying “The App Store revolutionized mobile apps. We hope to do the same for PC apps with the Mac App Store by making finding and buying PC apps easy and fun.” Apple had already long been promoting applications for Macs via a menu beneath the Apple icon on every OS X computer, which takes you to Apple’s website page that hosts apps of all flavors–paid and free. But this system was a simple list, and offered you no real “ecosystem” in the same way iTunes App Store does for iOS devices. The new Mac App Store will wrap the offered apps up in a better way, make it far easier to find relevant or “hot” apps, and everything is done automagically so “you can purchase, download and install apps in just one click and start using them immediately.” We also learn that updates will happen through the Mac App Store now, which extends the system-centric “software update” powers to potentially every bit of software on your Mac. And Apple’s confirmed the usual 70%/30% vendor-Apple split of sales revenue will exist–vendors are not charged for free apps and do “not have to pay hosting, marketing or credit card fees.” This is going to be a great motivator for some smaller software houses since it frees them up from infrastructure that may be troublesome, expensive or time-consuming, and it could easily spur some innovative new code to be written. To read more news on this, and similar stuff, keep up with my updates by following me, Kit Eaton, on Twitter.<|im_end|>

# Snapshot of health concerns among the Leeds population

Worries over poor quality housing and people being priced out of using leisure facilities were among the findings of a mass public health consultation.  Hundreds of people took part in the Leeds Big Chat, which asked people for their views to help NHS and council bosses tackle health inequalities in the city. A report published by Healthwatch Leeds, the city’s health and social care watchdog, said: “People told us that they love living in Leeds, not least because the people are so friendly. They also said that the enjoy living in a big and diverse city which offers both great shopping and access to green spaces.” But there were concerns over access to facilities to help people live healthy lives. The report said: “Some people told us that a lack of time and motivation makes it difficult to take part in healthy activities. Poor health was another reason why people find it harder to get involved in healthy activities.” Some 45 people who took part said leisure facilities were too expensive and that free or cheaper activities would encourage them to stay fit and active. Others were concerned about food prices and the cost and reliability of public transport. The report said: “Some people said that it was too expensive to buy healthy food and that public transport was not affordable. “Many people also raised concerns about congestion in the city and suggested that fewer cars in the city centre and more pedestrian areas would make Leeds a better city for health and wellbeing.” People told Healthwatch that they saw their GP practice as important in helping them manage their health. But there were concerns over access to mental health services and waiting times for treatment. The report said: “Many people are happy with the health services they receive in Leeds, but some people are unhappy with access to specialist services and waiting times, especially for GP surgery appointments. “Many people told us that they want better mental health services in the city, with improved access to counselling and shorter waiting lists.” People said the stability of housing had a significant impact on health and wellbeing. The report said: “Some people told us that they want better housing in Leeds, especially for deprived communities and the homeless.” NHS, council and charity organisations took part in the Leeds Big Chat, the first event of its kind. Around 500 people took part in a day-long consultation at Leeds Kirkgate Market. Further Big Chat events are planned for the city.<|im_end|>

# Could OrganiGram Holdings Be a Millionaire-Maker Stock?

Becoming a marijuana millionaire sounds pretty appealing, doesn't it? Global marijuana markets are booming. Marijuana stocks are hot. And one of the hottest right now is OrganiGram Holdings (NASDAQOTH: OGRMF). Its shares have soared around 45% so far in 2019. But could OrganiGram really be a millionaire-maker stock? Let's look at what it would take. Continue Reading Below Crunching the numbers The achievability of a goal depends on how far away the goal is. For example, even first-graders can slam dunk a basketball when the goal is only 4 feet high. Similarly, you could probably make $1 million pretty easily by buying OrganiGram if you had just a little under $1 million lying around to invest in the stock. Another important factor in making a goal happen is the amount of time you have. If you could live as long as Methuselah, your chances of becoming a millionaire with OrganiGram would probably be reasonably good. I'm going to assume you're not already a near-millionaire and that you won't live for 969 years. Instead, let's say you have $10,000 to invest in a stock and an investing horizon of 15 years. That gives us solid parameters to use in determining whether OrganiGram could realistically be a millionaire-maker stock. To turn a $10,000 initial investment into $1 million requires a 100-fold return. OrganiGram's market cap currently stands at around $660 million, so that means the company would need to grow to a market cap of roughly $66 billion over the next 15 years. The marijuana producer would deliver a compound annual growth rate of nearly 36% during that period. Advertisement Let's use a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 5, which is close to the midpoint between the average P/S ratio for the tobacco industry and the multiple for the alcoholic beverage industry -- both of which are similar in some respects to the cannabis industry. This P/S ratio means that to reach a market cap of $66 billion, OrganiGram would need to rack up annual sales of $13.2 billion within the next 15 years. Could OrganiGram do it? Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics project that total worldwide legal marijuana sales in 2019 will be around $18 billion. The two research companies think the total will soar to $32 billion by 2022. But just how big could the global marijuana market be 15 years from now? You might have heard marijuana executives mention that the current global marijuana market is $150 billion. This figure stems from a United Nations report and includes both legal and illegal sales of cannabis. But with increasingly more countries legalizing medical marijuana and a few also allowing legal recreational marijuana, the total addressable market for OrganiGram and its peers is almost sure to expand rapidly. And the UN number doesn't include new markets for cannabis-infused beverages and other products. Constellation Brands did its own number-crunching before investing $4 billion in Canopy Growth. The big alcoholic-beverage maker estimated that the addressable retail cannabis market could top $230 billion within the next 15 years. If Constellation's projections are right, OrganiGram would need to capture a little under 6% of the global marijuana market. The company probably couldn't deliver on that goal anytime soon, though. OrganiGram has less than 5% of the total production capacity projected for the 10 biggest marijuana producers. However, it's not out of the question that OrganiGram could boost its production capacity enough over the next few years. I've viewed OrganiGram as a dark-horse candidate for landing a deal with a big partner outside the cannabis industry. If that happened, the company's chances of expanding its capacity and international presence enough to capture nearly 6% of the global marijuana market would improve. Better questions As the numbers we've just seen indicate, there are definitely significant hurdles to overcome. Also, those numbers depend on several key assumptions that might not pan out -- especially the must-have that the U.S. changes federal marijuana laws in the near future. I think it's possible that OrganiGram could be a millionaire-maker stock. However, the odds are higher that it won't happen. The best question to ask isn't whether OrganiGram can be a millionaire-maker stock. Instead, I suggest asking two other questions: Can OrganiGram deliver strong long-term returns? Are there stocks that could be even bigger winners than OrganiGram? I think the answer to both of these questions is "yes." 10 stocks we like better than OrganiGram HoldingsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

# Art exhibition explores ethics of court representations

Canadian video and documentary artist Jean-Paul Kelly is bringing his interest around censorship to Plug In Institute for Contemporary Art (ICA).  That ends that matter is Kelly’s exhibition of his interest in showing and hiding what is taboo to most people, whether that is socially or legally.  “Primarily, I’m interested in the ethics of the artist, but also the ethics of seeing, sight and reading, and how those ethics can be translated into aesthetic form,” Kelly says.  Kelly’s project began with a residency in London, in England at the Delfina Foundation, an international artist residency organization. His focus was on the Magistrate’s court there, and in a law of contempt that prohibits any drawings, audio or video recordings or representations of any kind from being made in the courtroom, other than handwritten notes.  “The process really began in that limitation, and I’m interested as an artist in those limitations, in what can be represented and what can’t be represented,” Kelly says. “Ethically, physically, formally, personally (in terms of what people and artists will and will not explore.) I’m interested in the choices that we make.”  The exhibition at Plug In ICA will show three videos. One is a re-enactment of Kelly’s experience sitting in on the Magistrate’s court proceedings, where the camera is his point of view. However, the proceedings themselves were not what Kelly was as interested in showing.  “It’s very opaque and abstract. It’s the moments in between, there’s no utterance of language or anything like that in the space,” Kelly says. “Mostly people just fidget and look away.”  The odd time, one of the performers will look directly into the camera, breaking the boundary between the viewer and the viewed.  The other part of the exhibit shows found material that looks at the policing of vision in queer desire, at people in court covering their faces to protect their identity, and at protest control – in terms of attacking protesters’ sense of sight with tear gas or pepper spray and the protestors’ reactions to that.  Plug In ICA is in its 47th year of operation, making it one of the oldest arts organizations of its kind in Canada.  Jenifer Papararo, the executive director at Plug In, says the gallery is working to build new audiences for contemporary art around Winnipeg. The art gallery offers free admission and inclusive space where the meaning of contemporary art is expanded through many different perspectives and cultures, Papararo says.  As for Kelly’s exhibition, Papararo says the subject of the piece is how people document their experiences.  Kelly “is questioning journalism, documentary as a format and whether it has the ability to be truly objective in giving information,” she says. “He’s not just critiquing it. He’s looking for other ways to build that questioning and conveying meaning through visual art.”  That ends that matter will be shown in Plug In ICA in the Buhler Center until March 24, 2019.<|im_end|>

# What’s Up With Business Travel?

It’s no news that business travel has plummented during the recession. Economy travel, which comprises 90 percent of airline ticketing, has also taken a hit, but the decline of business travel has been far more precipitous, as corporations discover other ways to prospect for new business, hold meetings, and make connections — or decide to just do without. The thing is, none of the business travel substitutes hold a candle to the real thing. Still, the real worry for the major U.S. air carriers — all of the travel service providers that are part of the road warrior supply chain — is whether former business travel levels will come back at all, and, if so, when. The reason for airlines’ concern about the rebound of business travel is that the loss of these higher-paying road warriors has been a real drag on ticket prices. As Dallas Morning News’ Terry Maxon points out, business travelers are “the key to airline profitability.” Worldwide the number of premium tickets sold in September — the latest month for which figures are available — declined 13.9 percent from a year ago. Premium tickets are purchased primarily by business travelers, who, as MarketWatch reports, “have been absent most of the year” from the air travel picture as companies have sought to slash discretionary spending. In fact, premium travel figures for 2009 have plummented about 19 percent vs. the same period the previous year, according to the International Air Transport Association. In one promising note, recently Continental CEO Larry Kellner observed that business air traffic is starting to stabilize. But, Kellner noted, “one data point doesn’t make a trend.” Overall, travel has declined for 12 straight months, according to the U.S. Air Transport Association. At the same time, the airlines’ cargo volumes, which have a big impact on the airlines’ profitability, have declined for 14 consecutive months. So, while an economic recovery may be under way, historically, rebounds in business travel are tied directly to lower unemployment levels, and thus always lag the recovery. Buttressing this point is Dan Reed in USA Today, who says that analysts are predicting that it may be 2011 before U.S. carriers return to decent profitability, that is, when business travel is projected to rebound sufficiently to cover the airlines’ higher fuel and other operating costs. The bottom line is that air traffic figures may look better this month, but, until the premium-ticket-paying road warrior returns, the airlines’ bottom lines will continue to show little improvement.

# Will Fans Pay Public Enemy to Make a New Album or Just Buy Old Hits on CD?

At every step of their music industry and lyrical innovation, the hip-hop group Public Enemy has been a magnet for irony. A collective of self-proclaimed radicals lead by rapper Chuck D and hype man Flavor Flav, they’ve championed positive black causes and shouted out everyone from Jesse Jackson and Martin Luther King to Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan. But one of their most memorable contributions to mainstream music was a cover version of their own song “Bring the Noise” with thrash metal group Anthrax. They railed against the scourge of freebase cocaine in “Night of the Living Baseheads,” then Flavor Flav developed a crack problem. They blasted a fictitious woman for watching garbage TV in “She Watch Channel Zero?!,” then Flav became a reality star in Flavor of Love on VH1. Now the group has announced its plans to flip the script on the major-label-driven music business model by making an album with an Amsterdam-based company SellaBand, which asks fans to front the cost of a new record (and share in any profits). At the same time, Def Jam, Public Enemy’s old label, a subsidiary of Universal, is slapping one of their hits on the Def Jam 25 Anniversary Collection, a 5-CD crate (remember CDs?) of re-issued songs from the back catalog, a classic moneymaking scheme for labels. SellaBand will ask fans to help PE raise $250,000, which will pay for the cost of production and distribution of a yet-to-be-written, yet-to-be-named record. Participants, called “Believers”–because, let’s face it, the album could be as superb as 1995’s It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back or as atrocious as 2005’s New Whirl Odor–can buy one of 10,000 “parts” of the forthcoming record for as little as $25. “SellaBand’s financial engine model goes about restructuring the music business in reverse,” said the company’s new “ambassador,” Chuck D, in a statement. “It starts with fans first, then the artists create from there. The music business is built on searching for fans and this is a brand new way for acts to create a new album with fans first, already on board.” Def Jam, on the other hand, will ask buyers to pay a yet-to-be-disclosed retail price (likely at least double the $25 SellaBand/PE per-share cost) for five-discs worth of classic tunes released on the label from 1984-2008 (LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Beastie Boys, Oran “Juice” Jones, and more), tunes they likely already own and definitely know by heart. The discs, plus a full-color, 59-page book with an 8,000-word essay from author Bill Adler (Tougher Than Leather), come in a plastic crate, the kind DJs stuffed full of vinyl records and grocers stuffed into landfills. PE fans will find the group’s track on disc one, a 1989 banger called “Fight the Power.”<|im_end|>

# Hacking, Like The Weather, Is Seasonal

Hackers, malicious and otherwise, are just people–that’s easy to forget, but it also means their hacks are subject to human habits too. A recent survey by Tufin Technologies suggests that the summer and weekends are low hacking periods. A survey of the hackers attending this month’s Defcon 17 conference turned up these rather interesting results: Only 25% of the hacker community is thought to be the malicious Black Hat type, according to the majority of the Defcon 17 hackers themselves. And when these dodgy coders are doing their worst, most often their hacks happen in the Winter holidays. About 81% of the hackers say they’re more active during this period. 6% of hackers say Christmas is in fact the ideal time to tackle a corporate network, while 25% think New Year’s Eve is best. As well as being an interesting curio, this is revealing. Let’s assume those 81% Winter hackers are more active because they’re more often stuck indoors–it illustrates that the majority of hackers live in the northern hemisphere, subject to its Wintery chill. The Holiday season is also an obvious time to effect hack attacks because many staff are on leave–the hackers themselves and, more importantly, IT staff at big companies. There’s another lesson to be learned here: This Winter, keep your IT staff in action and surveilling your network instead of granting them leave, and you many find your network security doesn’t get breached too badly by a hacker trying a direct assault. You might want to restructure the hours your IT security staff work too, since 30% of hacking gets done during normal business hours, but 52% happens after work during the week. Of course, the timezone issue messes some of this up, since hacking is usually a remote operation and there’s no reason a hacker would particularly target nearby businesses. But at least weekends are still safe: Hackers like time off as much as the rest of us, and only 15% of them get busy on the weekends. Oh, and while we’re on the subject, remember we reminded you that your Mac isn’t necessarily as safe from viruses and hacks as you may think? It seems Apple’s taken that on board too–there’s news out that the folks in Cupertino have bolted in a whole bunch of new anti-virus protection into the imminent Snow Leopard operating system. It appears that the software now scans drives for malicious code, and alerts you to its presence, though there’s no word on how often its virus registry will be refreshed to deal with new threats as they surface. Still, it’s a move in the right direction. Here’s the full text of the survey news release: Tufin Survey: Hackers Say Take a Break This Summer Before Winter Hacking Spike Hacker Survey at DEFCON Reveals Hackers Work the Night Shift; 
Believe Compliance Initiatives Don’t Improve A Company’s Security 
Posture Ramat Gan Israel, August 25, 2009–Tufin Technologies, the 
leading provider of Security Lifecycle Management solutions, today 
announced the findings of its “Hacker Habits” survey conducted amongst 
79 hackers attending DEFCON 17 in Las Vegas earlier this month. Enjoy 
your summer vacation says the hacking community, as you’re far less 
likely to be targeted now than during your Christmas and New Year’s 
vacation. Eighty nine percent of hackers admitted that IT professionals 
taking a summer vacation would have little impact on their hacking 
activities, as a whopping 81% revealed they are far more active during 
the winter holidays with 56% citing Christmas as the best time to 
engage in corporate hacking and 25% specifically naming New Years Eve. “The survey reveals that the Christmas and New Year holidays are 
popular with hackers targeting western countries,” said Michael 
Hamelin, chief security architect, Tufin Technologies. “Hackers know 
this is when people relax and let their hair down, and many 
organizations run on a skeleton staff over the holiday period.” If you want to know when you should be most on your guard it’s 
during weekday evenings with 52% stating that this is when they spend 
most of their time hacking, 32% during work hours (weekdays), and just 
15% hacking on weekends. Ninety six percent of hackers in the survey said it doesn’t matter 
how many millions a company spends on its IT security systems, it’s all 
a waste of time and money if the IT security administrators fail to 
configure and watch over their firewalls. Eighty six percent of 
respondents’ felt they could successfully hack into a network via the 
firewall; a quarter believed they could do so within minutes, 14% 
within a few hours. Sixteen percent wouldn’t hack into a firewall even 
if they could. “This may be stating the obvious,” said Hamelin, “but poorly 
configured firewalls remain a significant risk for many organizations. 
It’s not the technology that’s at fault, but rather the configuration 
and change control processes that are neglected or missing altogether. 
Best practice suggests you should test and review your firewall 
configuration regularly, but many organizations fail to do so.” Validating the frustrating gap between compliance and security, 
seventy percent of the hackers interviewed don’t feel that regulations 
introduced by governments worldwide to implement privacy, security and 
process controls has made any difference to their chances of hacking 
into a corporate network. Of the remaining 30%, 15% said compliance 
initiatives have made hacking more difficult and 15% believe they’ve 
made it easier. “These results further validate the reality that there is little 
common ground between compliance and security, but as an industry we 
have the collective knowledge and the resources to change that,” said 
Hamelin. “As the media constantly reminds us, while standards such as 
PCI-DSS provide a good baseline, organizations that assume achieving 
PCI compliance will solve their security woes are in for a rude 
awakening. With security and compliance budgets so deeply intertwined, 
it serves us as security professionals to make the two more synonymous. 
At the end of the day, the more accountable we are willing to be, the 
less we’ll have to be.” With the Network Solutions breach being the latest in a series of 
widely reported breaches of PCI compliant companies, how big is the 
threat of a high-profile malicious hack? One important factor in 
determining that is to understand the scope of criminal activity. Seventy percent of those sampled believe the number of malicious 
hackers–criminals motivated by economic gain– is less then 25% of 
the of hacker community. “I never fail to leave DEFCON without new insights on the nature of 
cyber crime and how to prevent it,” said Hamelin. “My biggest 
take-aways from the survey are that cyber security investments are only 
as effective as the people, processes and technology tasked with 
managing them. Just as a small subset of criminal hackers can taint the 
reputation of an entire community, a few good guys willing to be 
accountable for their internal processes and technology can preserve a 
company’s reputation. With winter right around the corner, we have time 
to shift the dynamic from 86% who can hack into a network through its 
firewalls to 86% that can’t.”<|im_end|>

# Introducing face yoga: nature’s facelift

We go to the gym and we do exercise such as yoga to keep the muscles of our body fit, firm and healthy. The muscles in the face are the same as the muscles in the rest the body; they can also be exercised and toned.  Think of face yoga as a gym workout for your face, the natural botox and filler. The day after I teach an hour session of face yoga, my cheeks and my jawline hurt like I had been laughing all day and clenching my jaw like a madman.  The health benefits of face yoga:  improves tonus of muscles; activates blood circulation in affected areas; strengthens elastic fibres of the face; helps to relieve swelling; increases oxygen and blood flow to the face; helps with clear speech; increases lymphatic flow in the face and neck, reducing trapped toxins; and gives skin elasticity and smoothness. The cosmetic benefits of face yoga:  helps to remove wrinkles and creases; uplifts corners of the mouth; slimmer, more defined cheeks (for those who currently have a fuller face); fuller cheeks (for those with a bony/ slimmer face); wider, fuller lips/mouth; decreases nasolabial fold lines; wide, open eyes; less droopy eyelids; reduced forehead lines; a more relaxed overall look; a happier face creates a happier spirit; reduced lines around and dark circles underneath the eyes; more symmetrical facial expression; and smoother, more youthful looking skin. As we have limited space here, I will give you my three go-to face yoga moves for a quick, easy tone-up of the face muscles. It really is like a mini facelift.  I have focused on the main issues of the face that most women are con­cerned with: tighter skin, brighter eyes and plumper lips  1.The big O  To smoothen the nasolabial folds.  Say “wow” in a very slow and exag­gerated manner, opening your mouth as wide as possible.  Repeat 10 times. 2.The under eye relaxer  To relieve puffy, tired eyes.  Rub your hands together until warm. Take your warms hands and place them over your eyes. Bend your head and look down to the floor and completely support the weight of your head.  Hold for 10 seconds. 3.The lip plumper  For natural, full, plump lips.  Fold your lips into your teeth, stick out your tongue between your teeth and gently bite down with a firm pressure.  Hold for five seconds. Repeat three times. You can practise these face yoga moves at any time of the day but my suggestion would be to practise them in the morning and at night and perhaps even while waiting in the delightful Phuket traffic.  Enjoy playing with your face this month and happy stretching.

# Grad student activity fee decrease recommended

The Senate approved the Union Annual Report Committee’s recommendation for the Fiscal Year 2020 activity fee and the Union Annual Report Fiscal Year 2020 on January 28.  Prior to the presentation on the activity fee, Grand Marshal Stef Warner ’19 stressed that this is just a recommendation for the president of the Institute and the Board of Trustees, so “this is not the last stop that this activity fee will have.”  The activity fee is charged to all Rensselaer students alongside their tuition, and currently serves as the primary source of income for the Union. This money—in addition to income from the Collegiate Store and other businesses within the Union—is what the Executive Board budgets and spends each year. It pays for clubs and their programming; operating the Union, Mueller Center, and RPI Playhouse; the employment of staff; and other student services. The specifics of how this money is allocated and spent is detailed in the Union Annual Report for that specific fiscal year, and is made available to the public. In 1985, the activity fee for undergraduate and graduate students were separated, so that they could more fairly charge students based on what they use.  The activity fee and reasoning behind its value was explained by Union Annual Report Committee Chairperson Mary Clare Crochiere ’19 and President of the Union Justin Etzine ’18 G ’19 in a presentation.  For the first time—according to the memories of Crochiere, Etzine, and the Union staff—the UAR Committee proposed a decrease in the graduate student activity fee from $342 to $338. Crochiere and Etzine explained that this decision was based on “attendance analytics” and the desire to charge graduate students more accurately based on their use of the Union and its activities. When asked about the specifics of these analytics, Etzine explained that they used the Institute’s swipe attendance system at events and the Mueller center, along with memberships and attendances listed by clubs.  Last year, the Graduate Council gave a presentation on why the activity fee should be lowered for graduate students; it cited lower-than-assumed participation rates and a difference in culture that prevented as much involvement in Union activities. However, most of the Senate agreed that these issues were brought up too late and should instead be discussed for the 2020 fiscal year.  The proposed undergraduate activity fee was $407, up $13 from the $394 activity fee last year. Undergraduate class dues—which are factored into the total activity fee—increased by 50 cents to resume funding for the undergraduate council, following the council’s “resurgence of purpose and responsibility.” The reasons listed for impacting this recommendation were the increase in New York’s minimum wage, standard annual increase in professional staff wages, adjustments for inflation, and the aforementioned “increased accuracy for participation splits between undergraduate and graduate students based on attendance analytics.”  The motion to approve the recommendations for the Union activity fees passed unanimously.  The Senate then moved on to the actual Union Annual Report Fiscal Year 2020; there was no presentation on the report, but it was emailed out to the Senate on the day of the meeting at 11:15 am. There were no questions, and the motion to approve the Union Annual Report Fiscal Year 2020, “pending the Board of Trustees’ approval of the Activity Fee Recommendation and overall budget in March 2019” passed unanimously.  The language of these motions has changed from last year’s approval of the activity fee and the UAR, to specify that these amounts are “recommendations” that are pending approval.  This change was made to bring procedures into compliance with financial protocol of the Institute, as outlined in a memorandum sent to Etzine—who was the president of the Union at the time—on May 7, 2018. The memo, sent by former Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Virginia C. Gregg, specified that these student activity fees are reviewed and approved by the president and Board of Trustees “as part of the institutional budget process.”  “Accordingly, no announcement of or statement about activity fees or the Union budget should be made until after approval of the institutional budget,” wrote Gregg.<|im_end|>

# Reach Out and Read Donation

Reach Out and Read Donation  Tuesday, February 12, 2019 
 
 The SoutheastHEALTH Foundation received a $1,450 donation from The Rushing Family Trust on February 5, 2019 to benefit the Reach Out and Read program at the Southeast Pediatrics office. Reach Out and Read is a national program developed to promote a love of reading and encourage children to read together with their families. Books are given to children ages 6 months to 5 years old at their well child checkup. Since its inception, 4 million children across the country have been positively impacted by Reach Out and Read.  To further its mission of making a positive difference in the lives of disadvantaged women and children, and others with extraordinary needs, The Rushing Family Trust holds the Captain Woody Rushing Golf Tournament each October. Proceeds from the 20th annual tournament, held at Kimbeland Country Club last year, made this donation possible. A total of $13,000 will be donated to 13 organizations from the 2018 tournament proceeds.

# 'Green man times' at new Toll Bar junction to be extended

The length of time pedestrians will be able to cross the road at the new Toll Bar junction will be extended at certain times of the day to allow for school children to cross.  Work starts in July to replace the roundabout with traffic lights and toucan crossing to improve safety for students at the nearby Tollbar Academy.  North East Lincolnshire Council has also said that it wants to increase the junction's capacity to reduce congestion.  The new junction, which is set to be completed in early 2020, will see toucan crossing installed at all four points, along with a larger crossing on the northern arm of the A16, where the majority of pedestrians cross the road from New Waltham.  At the beginning and the end of the school days, the council says that "green man times" at the junction will be "optimised" so that pedestrians crossing the road will have a longer period to get safely across the road.  "Smart traffic lights" with special sensors will be used to monitor traffic flow and the number of pedestrians using the crossing, so that the length of time that the green man is on display can be extended when needed.  They will be used on both the pedestrian crossing and traffic signals, improving safety for all users.  A North East Lincolnshire Council spokesperson: “The traffic lights that will be used at the junction have special sensors to detect and monitor traffic flow at all times.  "These enable the timings of the traffic signals to change, making sure that pedestrians have sufficient time to cross the road, and that the junction can process high levels of traffic efficiently at peak times. This makes the junction safer for pedestrians and motorists.”  Last year the council approved controversial plans to replace the roundabout with traffic lights, in a move that was widely opposed by local residents, councillors, Toll Bar Academy and Cleethorpes MP Martin Vickers.  The Toll Bar Residents Action Group was formed amongst residents to oppose the plan, and they spent more than a year staging protests and gathering more than 6,000 signatures for a petition calling for the scheme to be scrapped.  They are concerned that the council's plans will make the junction a "high speed death trap", and are worried that cars will try and "jump" the traffic lights to avoid stopping. Something that would not be possible with a roundabout.  Follow or contact Grimsby Live  Contact us: Email the reporter who wrote this story .

# Elks to hold charity roast to benefit veterans, children with disabilities

By Grace Elliott The community is invited to witness local veteran services leader, William “Bill” Reynolds, take center stage to be roasted at the Santa Clarita Elks Lodge on Saturday. The net proceeds from the fundraiser will benefit two major charity priorities of the Elks — local veterans services in the Santa Clarita Valley and children with disabilities in California, through the Elks California-Hawaii Elks Major Project Inc.  City Councilman and lodge member, Bob Kellar, has been planning his strategy as emcee for the evening’s program. He and three of the roasters, Elks CHEA trustee Jay Larkins, Santa Clarita City Manager Ken Striplin and Iraq War veteran Mike Garcia, have been taking their involvement seriously. They have been heard fine-tuning and laughing hysterically about the entertaining, yet totally fabricated information they will present in an attempt to discredit Bill’s excellent reputation and accomplishments. Reynolds and his family have been Santa Clarita residents since the 1980s. He has been involved with numerous local veterans outreach efforts and service. Tickets are $50 each and may be purchased at the Elks Lodge Lounge or through the Elks Office, 17766 Sierra Highway, Santa Clarita, phone 661-251-1500. Tables of 10 are available for $500.

# Amazon, General Motors in Talks to Invest in Electric Pickup Truck Maker Rivian: Sources

Amazon, General Motors in Talks to Invest in Electric Pickup Truck Maker Rivian: Sources  The deal would give Amazon and GM minority stakes in Rivian, the sources said. It would be a major boost for the Plymouth, Michigan-based startup, which aspires to be the first carmaker to the U.S. consumer market with an electric pickup.

	Amazon.com and General Motors are in talks to invest in Rivian Automotive LLC in a deal that would value the U.S. electric pickup truck manufacturer at between $1 billion and $2 billion, people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier. The deal would give Amazon and GM minority stakes in Rivian, the sources said. It would be a major boost for the Plymouth, Michigan-based startup, which aspires to be the first carmaker to the U.S. consumer market with an electric pickup.  If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced as early as this month, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. There is always a chance that deal talks fall through, the sources cautioned. 
			 "We admire Rivian's contribution to a future of zero emissions and an all-electric future," GM said in an emailed statement, declining to specifically comment on any talks with Rivian. Amazon and Rivian declined comment. The Rivian deal would come as its much larger electric car manufacturing rival, Tesla, struggles to stabilize production and deliver consistent profits as it rolls out its flagship Model 3 sedan.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk told investors last August that an electric pickup is "probably my personal favourite for the next product" from the company, though he has spoken only in general about a potential launch, saying that it would happen "right after" Tesla's Model Y, which the company has targeted to start production in 2020.  'SKATEBOARD' PLATFORM  Rivian intends to begin selling its R1T, the pickup it debuted in November, in the fall of 2020. The company was founded in 2009 by CEO R.J. Scaringe. Scaringe has described the Rivian vehicle's platform as a "skateboard" that packages the drive units, battery pack, suspension system, brakes and cooling system all below wheel height to allow for more storage space and greater stability due to a lower centre of gravity.  He has also said the company plans to partner with outside firms to develop advanced self-driving technology, rather than try to do so on its own. Big automakers, including GM, have not jumped into the market for electric pickups thus far. GM CEO Mary Barra has said it has given a "tiny bit" of thought to developing all-electric pickups.  The No. 1 U.S. automaker is counting on profit from sales of conventional large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America to fund its electrification push. GM said last November it was doubling resources allocated to developing electric and self-driving vehicles, as part of a significant restructuring that included ending production at five North American plants.  GM last month announced a strategy to make its luxury Cadillac its lead electric vehicle brand, revealing it would be the first vehicle built on the Detroit automaker’s "BEV3" platform to challenge Tesla. GM has said one of the first fully electric Cadillac models using the new platform would hit the market around 2022.  Amazon has also invested in self-driving car startup Aurora Innovation, in a $530 million funding round announced last week. The world’s largest online retailer has steadily increased its logistics footprint, building warehouses around the world and inking deals with Mercedes as well as cargo airlines to help with delivery.  Rivian's existing financial backers include Saudi auto distributor Abdul Latif Jameel Co (ALJ), Sumitomo Corp of Americas and Standard Chartered Bank. ALJ has agreed to provide almost $500 million in funding, Sumitomo invested an undisclosed amount, and Standard Chartered provided debt financing of $200 million.

# Quantitative Easing On Demand

Some things are worth repeating so that their potential effects may be fully appreciated. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly recently said that the U.S. central bankers are currently debating whether it should confine its controversial tool of bond buying to purely emergency situations or if it should turn to that tool more regularly.  She said,   In the financial crisis, in the aftermath of that when we were trying to help the economy, we engaged in these quantitative easing policies, and an important question is, should those always be in the tool kit, should you always have those at your ready, or should you think about those are only tools you use when you really hit the zero lower bound and you have no other things you can do. Then she stated the almost unthinkable, from a few months ago,   You could imagine executing policy with your interest rate as your primary tool and the balance sheet as a secondary tool, but one that you would use more readily. That's not decided yet, but it's part of what we are discussing now. This idea will have a profound influence on both the bond and equity markets, if instituted. It first means that the Fed will always be "IN!" Meaning that the Fed is going to determine, on a constant and ongoing basis, whether Quantitative Easing should be used, for any of a number of reasons. It also means that they Fed will always be in control, because you can't fight the people that make the currency. You have no chance, zero, of going against them because you do not have the same power that they do, which is to print money.  If the Fed does decide to pursue this strategy it will be a wholesale change in the way the financial system in the United States operates and I think that very few institutions or people appreciates what is taking place or what it will means to the markets, all of the markets. This new concept dramatically enforces my opinion that interest rates will be "lower for longer and lingering." We are not talking about some academic notion here but a fundamental change in what asset class will become more valuable, and what asset classes will diminish in value.  On the negative side will be the Pension Funds that will adversely affected by a prolonged period of low interest rates. It will also make it more difficult for retirees and senior citizens who depend upon their cash flows, to lead their lives. It may force both of these groups to make riskier bets to maintain their cash flows, their streams of income, and I expect just that to happen.  On the positive side are those people and institutions that borrow money as their costs of borrowing will not be going up. This will allow for increased corporate profits, more corporate equity buy-backs, and for lower mortgage and commercial loan rates. REITs, in my opinion, will gain from this new strategy and whether it is a single REIT or a closed-end fund of REITs, both classes of assets should benefit.  Even in a slowing economy, with questions about tariffs headlining the Press, lower interest rates may neutralize, or even more than off-set, these other issues. It has been 10 years since the financial crisis of 2008/2009 and the central bankers may finally have learned some lessons. The primary lesson here is that lower interest rates can drive economic expansion and that the Fed, as well as other global central banks, can totally control the level of interest rates, and hence borrowing costs, by the way that rates are handled.  Lower interest rates means more corporate expansion as the cost of expansion is not prohibitive. It means more buy-outs as the costs are affordable. It means more merger activity, as those borrowing costs do not block some deal. It also means that future borrowing costs may come down as bonds are rolled over and the credit markets tighten in to Treasuries.  For the government, with a rising amount of Treasuries to be auctioned, it also means that the amount that needs to be sold will have an off-set, which is a lower cost of funding. This will be a net positive for the American government, in my opinion, as the lowered cost of borrowing money stabilizes or overcomes the increasing need for money. It may be all a clever trick but it is one that we have seen work, during the last ten years.  For the American banks, if this program is instituted, it is a negative. Spreads between the cost of money for them and their ability to loan at higher yields will compress. It is not a disaster but it is something to consider when apprising both bank debt and equities.  If this new strategy does take place it is also a positive for the High Yield Market. Their cost of refinancing, or adding new debt, will be far less than what many people think now and the compression to Treasuries will give many companies, in this space, a welcome reprieve from a higher cost of funds. Here is another area to carefully consider, if the Fed changes their policy.   The Government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the Government and the buying power of consumers. By the adoption of these principles, the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest. Money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity.  - Abraham Lincoln  "Immense sums of interest" may be saved here, if the Fed adopts these new principles. The key issue for investors is going to be who is going to be the beneficiaries. The assumed answers will no longer suffice.

# Highland Heroes: Friends help save cow from frozen pond

MIDDLESEX, Vt. (WCAX) It started as a ski adventure for two friends, but it ended with something they will never forget.  About two weeks ago, Ryan Horan and Stephen Davidson got their skis and headed out on a Middlesex ski excursion. While they were out, they saw some Highland cattle, but looking at the property they noticed something was off.  Now, they are being celebrated for rescuing a cow that preferred to be away from the herd. It could be that independence and cranky attitude that got Ginger stuck in freezing water.  "He's like, 'Ah, hey check it out. They have four big Highland beef cows, they are pretty friendly, they'll probably pop out and say hi to us,'" Horan recalled saying.  While admiring the cattle up close, Horan and Davidson saw one in the distance that looked stuck in the snow. When they got close, they saw Ginger stuck in a pond.  "It was certainly swimming. We saw it splashing about," Horan said.  Not seeing any neighbors, they got on their phones and called for help. Knowing help might take some time, the two friends found ropes, shovels and an ice pick and began to help the animal.  One of the first people to arrive and help with the rescue was Middlesex Asst. Fire Chief Jeff Koonz.  "These guys were kind of digging a kind of a ramp for her to get up. She would move up a little bit, and then stop she was out of breath," Koonz said.  Thirty minutes later, she was able to walk herself out of the pond. She was seen by a large animal veterinarian, who said she was healthy.  As for the "Highland Heroes," this lifesaving mission was something they did without thinking about.  "When you put yourself in that situation, and you see an animal that size just floundering, literally, Ryan and I both immediately went into saving mode. We didn't care what it was going to take," Davidson said.  "And now we have this Ginger lifelong friend, so she definitely recognizes us now, so it was pretty cool," Horan said.  The owners of the farm weren't home at the time this happened but are thankful to the two skiers.  Officials say if you see something like this, the first thing you should do is call the police or fire department. They say if you decide to help, make sure your safety is the priority.<|im_end|>

# Singaporeans can make use of New Zealand's eGate passport control from Feb 12

SINGAPORE: Singapore and New Zealand nationals will be able to make use of automated immigration facilities when travelling to each other's countries, Singapore's Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) announced on Monday (Feb 11). Eligible Singaporeans will be able to use New Zealand's eGate passport control facility from Tuesday when clearing immigration.  An automated way to get through passport control, eGates are available at Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown airports, according to the New Zealand customs service website. Users have to be 12 years old and above and must have an ePassport. Similarly, holders of New Zealand passports aged six and above will be eligible to apply for Singapore's Frequent Traveller Programme (FTP). Applicants from New Zealand must have a passport with more than six months' validity and have visited Singapore at least twice in the past two years. Enrolment for the FTP is voluntary and free, said the ICA in its news release. The programme allows eligible travellers to clear immigration via automated clearance facilities, also known as the enhanced immigration automated clearance system.  Those interested can apply for the FTP at the enrolment centres located at Terminal 3 Changi Airport, the visitor services centre at the ICA Building, as well as at Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints. "The mutual extension of such automated immigration clearance facilities is part of the Singapore-New Zealand Enhanced Partnership that both sides are establishing," said ICA. "It is expected to boost trade, business and tourism links between both countries." In 2017, the two countries started negotiations for an "enhanced partnership", which Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said will pave the way for the countries to broaden cooperation.<|im_end|>

# 3 people, including 2 students, arrested after trespassing incident at Jensen Beach High School

MARTIN COUNTY — Two Jensen Beach High School students and one other person were arrested Tuesday after an incident at the school. A robocall went out to parents saying an 18-year-old man who was not a student was arrested on a trespassing charge. School district spokeswoman Jennifer DeShazo said the 18-year-old was not permitted to be on school property because he isn't a Martin County school student. DeShazo said the Jensen Beach High School students helped the man get onto campus and were arrested on unknown charges related to helping him get onto campus. DeShazo said the two students were both charged with disruption of a school function.  All four people were taken to the Martin County Jail, according to the robocall. No further information was available. Martin County sheriff's officials were holding a news conference at 4:30 p.m.<|im_end|>

# ‘Is there anything I can do, specifically to you?’: Candidate offers recruiter a ‘blow job’

#MeToo - A year of progress amid a backlash1:20 Over the past year, #MeToo has given women the power to fight back against sexual assault and oppression. It has also grown more complex, with several setbacks causing a backlash which threatens to undermine the message behind the cause. A Melbourne recruiter has revealed the “shocking” moment a female candidate sent him a text message offering a sexual favour in exchange for a job. Graham Wynn, founder of HR firm Superior People Recruitment, says the highly inappropriate offer earlier this week placed him in a delicate situation “with all the harassment and #MeToo campaigns”. The woman had sent in her resume to apply for a receptionist job. Mr Wynn texted her on Wednesday afternoon to arrange an interview, asking her to advise a convenient time later this week. “Hi Graham. Is there anything I can do, specifically to you, that would help me get the job?” she wrote, adding a “winking” emoji. “Just to come and meet me and will see what I can do for you,” he replied. She wrote back, “Blow job?” Mr Wynn said at first he was “not quite sure what she was getting at” after the first message. “Then the next bit — ah OK,” he said. “That’s not appropriate.” He said he reacted with “shock initially”. “It was a shock in this day and age and all the things around #MeToo,” he said. “I put my phone down and walked away for five minutes. I asked people, ‘What do I do?’ My concern was, is this entrapment to see how I responded? With all this stuff going on.” While he considered ignoring her, colleagues advised him that “no response is actually not a good thing”. “No response could be taken as a response,” he said. “The rationale was because I didn’t say no, I may be open to it. I spoke to a couple of people and they said the best thing to do is respond by saying, ‘This is not appropriate’, something along those lines.” The recruiter said he had been offered bribes in the past, but this was a first. “I’ve been offered up to $20,000 to try and help them get a job, which we don’t do of course,” he said. “We get paid by employers. Those people are normally from overseas. Unfortunately there are unscrupulous (recruiters who do).” He added, “We quite often get abusive emails from people who didn’t get a job, but this sort of thing? No. I was quite taken aback by it. I spoke to a couple of people, they haven’t seen it that blatant before, no.” He later wrote back to the woman, “Refraining from ever sending texts like that would help. In general showing unethical traits or an inappropriate sense of humour tends to detract from one’s chances of getting a job.” Mr Wynn has had heard “nothing back since then”. “Obviously we won’t be putting her forward for the job,” he said.<|im_end|>

# Aussie skincare brand Aesop takes inspiration from a Toronto landmark for its latest location

Australian skin-care brand Aesop has quickly washed its way into the hearts of Canadians with its sudsy formulas, pleasing packaging and exquisite aromas. And while it may hail from oceans away, Aesop has made a point of immersing itself in the local scene, from taking visual cues from its surroundings for store decor to partnerships with local food, design and literature organizations including House of Anansi Press, the MoCA and DesignTO. Now 32 years old, the brand operates stand-alone stores across Canada in Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto.  With its new Eaton Centre location, Aesop hopes to bring that sense of community to the downtown Toronto mall. “We are delighted to offer our clients an opportunity to experience Aesop in a central location, in the heart of the city,” says Stuart Millar, general manager and president of Aesop Americas, adding that he hopes the boutique will become a place of respite for busy Torontonians. “Aesop Eaton Centre allows the opportunity to offer our guests a serene space amongst the bustling, vibrant city of Toronto.”  Stocked with the brand’s range of skin care, hair care, home fragrance and animal care, this new location looked across Bay Street to a nearby political landmark for aesthetic inspiration. “City Hall represents Toronto’s break from its past and its emergence as a dynamic international metropolis, and is established as a timeless icon of modernism in Canada,” Millar says. At the store, that translates to a grey palette and a saucer-like sink, an homage to the City Council chambers.  Aesop, CF Toronto Eaton Centre, 220 Yonge St., Toronto, 647-352-3676, aesop.com.

# Fever chase elusive repeat in Indianapolis sports

INDIANAPOLIS – The defense begins now for many, yet for some it’s been going on since the Fever tipped off their season in late May.  “When you get a ring to start the season and you’re the current defending champions, you take that to heart,” said Fever head coach Lin Dunn about the distinction of being the WNBA’s reigning champion. “That’s one of our goals is to defend our championship.”  It’s a task that no team in Fever history has taken on since the 2012 title was the first in franchise history. Defending the crown wasn’t easy as the team was decimated early by injuries and started the year 1-7 as they had to play some games with just eight healthy players.  Slowly the Fever got players back and made it to the playoffs as a fourth seed with a 16-18 record and will face the top-seeded Sky in the best-of-three series starting Friday at the UIC Pavilion.  “Just looking at the transition of our team and where we started off to where we are now, it’s definitely one of those things where it’s like ‘whew, we made the playoffs’,” said guard Tamika Catchings. “When we found out that we made it, it’s kinda like you don’t want to relax. Now we want to start prepping our team to make a push to defend our championship.”  There are a few advantages the Fever will have heading into the postseason that figures to help. For one, the use of multiple players due to injury gives the team a deep and experienced bench to help give starters a break in the short three-game series. Plus the Fever will be starting off their ninth-consecutive postseason against a Chicago team that has yet to play a WNBA Playoff game, which gives the team an opportunity to start fast.  “The playoffs, like coach (Dunn) said, is just a heightened amount of attention, scrutiny every play, every possession,” said Douglas. “Chicago hasn’t been there so our motto is and our trademark is defense so we’re gonna kinda amp it up and come out aggressive and, like you said, we’ve got a lot of experience.  “But they’ve been regular season tested, they got the number one seed so they’ve got that experience but the playoffs it’s a whole other ball game out there and hopefully we can use that to our advantage as well.”  If they can the Fever can join a unique group in the history of Indianapolis sports-repeat champions. Only two in professional sports in the modern era have been able to accomplish this feat-and one is in their own building.  During the height of their ABA dominance, the Pacers took home championships in the 1971-1972 season and the 1972-1973 seasons with starts like Roger Brown, Mel Daniels and George McGinnis. During their repeat run the Pacers beat Denver then Utah in the Western Division playoffs to advance to the ABA Finals to face the Kentucky Colonels.  In a memorable seven-game series, the Pacers went to Freedom Hall in the deciding game and beat the host Colonels 88-81 for the team’s third ABA title.  The Indianapolis Indians had an even better run of success in the late 1980’s when they took the American Association by storm. As an affiliate of the Montreal Expos, who featured future stars like Randy Johnson and Larry Walker along with franchise legend Razor Shines, the Indians won the league title from 1986-1989.  Since then, however, the city’s professional teams haven’t been able to bring home a repeat. The Indians won the 2000 International League crown but couldn’t repeat the next season. The Indianapolis Ice won an IHL and CHL championship but didn’t win a title in either league again.  The Colts got a repeat title in 1959 but that was during their days in Baltimore. In 2007 the team looked like they had a shot to win again when they followed their Super Bowl title from the year before with a 13-3 record but they fell victim to an upset in the AFC Divisional Playoff by the Chargers, who closed the RCA Dome with a 28-24 win.  Trying to live up to those expectations isn’t on the mind of someone like Douglas, who is trying to bring home a repeat with a time-honored philosophy.  “We just need to take it one game at a time and not look to far,” said Douglas. “We’ve got Game One Friday against Chicago, they got the number one seed so they’ve had a great regular season and obviously we have a target as the defending champs.  “So we’re gonna have a game plan this week and we’ll just be ready to go and hopefully use our championship experience from last year and bring that on into Friday night’s game.”<|im_end|>

# A complete guide to investing and I-T rebates under Section 80C

ALSO READ  
													
													 With the financial year drawing to close, income tax-payers would have started exploring various tax-saving investment options allowed under Sec 80C of the Income-Tax Act. However, with various payments and mandatory outflows also qualifying under Section 80C, the first step towards making tax saving investments under this Section is to figure out the required investment amount. Taxpayers can claim up to Rs 1.50 lakh as deductions under Section 80C. Apart from the various investment options eligible for availing Section 80C deduction, certain pay-outs and mandatory expenses are also covered under the same deduction. These include your child’s tuition fees, repayment of your home loan principal, your contribution to EPF or recognized provident fund, term insurance premiums and stamp duties and registration charges incurred on acquiring a home loan property. Your required investment amount would be the amount left after deducting the mandatory pay-outs from the Rs 1.50 lakh limit.  For example, assume that your gross annual income is Rs 7 lakh and your qualifying mandatory pay-outs include Rs 80,000 as home loan principal repayment, Rs 20,000 towards EPF contribution and Rs 10,000 as a term insurance premium. You will need to invest Rs 40,000 in the investment options eligible for Section 80C deduction. Investing beyond this amount would not make sense, as all Section 80C investment options come with lock-in period and other restraints.  Best investment options  Once you know the amount required for availing maximum deductions under Section 80C, it’s time to select the investment option(s) based on their liquidity and taxability of returns and your own risk appetite and return expectations.  Equity-Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS): These are primarily diversified equity mutual funds with a lock-in period of three years from the date of investment. The 3-year lock-in period is the shortest among all investment options available under Section 80C. The funds can be easily redeemed after the completion of the lock-in period with the credit of redemption amount to the linked bank account within 2–3 working days. Being equity funds, ELSS come with the same market risk as other equity funds. However, as equities usually outperform other asset classes by a wide margin over the long-term, ELSS too has outperformed various fixed income investment options under Section 80C. ELSS as a category has generated an annualised return of about 10%, 16% and 16.3% p.a. over the last 3-year, 5-year and 10-year periods.  As with other mutual funds, you can also opt for the systematic investment plan (SIP) mode of investments to ensure disciplined investing at regular intervals. The minimum investment amount can be as low as Rs 500. While ELSS too come under the ambit of 10% LTCG tax on equities, most retail investors are likely to end with tax-free maturity as only long term capital gains from equities exceeding Rs 1 lakh in a financial year is taxable.  Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs): ULIPs offer the combined benefits of insurance and investment. While a small part of your premium is used for providing your life cover, the remaining part is used for generating returns through investments in equities and/or debt instruments. ULIPs also have a longer lock-in period of 5 years and provide switching facility to switch between equity, debt or balanced options depending on your changing risk appetite, financial goals and market outlook.  Public provident fund (PPF): PPF is one of the safest among all Section 80C investment options. It is managed by the Government of India and both the principal and interest components are backed by the sovereign guarantee. The scheme is paying an interest rate of 8% p.a. compounded annually, which is reviewed by the Ministry of Finance every quarter based on the government bond yields. As the interest earned and maturity amount is completely tax-free, it offers one of the highest post-tax returns among all fixed income investment options. However, its long lock-in period of 15 years is its biggest drawback. Partial withdrawals are allowed only from the 7th year of subscription once in a year whereas premature closure is permitted after 5 years for treating life-threatening diseases or pursuing higher education.  National Pension Scheme (NPS): This is a market-linked investment product aimed at providing post-retirement financial security to its subscribers. An annual deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh is available under Section 80C whereas an additional deduction of Rs 50,000 is available under Section 80CCD(1B). The investments remain locked-in till the attainment of 60 years by the subscriber and at least 40% of the corpus has to be used for purchasing the post-retirement annuity. While the amount withdrawn as a lump sum after the maturity is tax-free, the income derived from the annuity will be taxable as per the subscriber’s tax-slab.  The subscribers can also choose between auto choice and active choice for the purpose of asset allocation. In case of active choice, the subscribers can decide their own asset mix by mentioning the ratio of their investments across corporate, gilt and equity funds. However, the maximum exposure to equity fund has been capped at 75%. On choosing the auto choice, the subscribers’ contribution will be spread across the corporate, gilt and equity funds based on the lifecycle matrix on the basis of the subscribers’ age.  
	Tax-saving FDs: While tax-saving FDs from the post office and banks score high in terms of capital protection and certainty of returns, their biggest disadvantage is the taxability of the interest income as per the tax slab of the depositor. While these tax-saving FDs come with a lock-in period of 5 years, the interest income can be paid out every quarter or every month or in lump sum at the time of maturity.

# We review the BMW X4 from price to economy and all its features

BMW is pushing out so many new models now it’s hard to keep up. More letter and number combinations are being added daily - the latest is the X4.  That X means it's an SUV, or Sports Utility Vehicle, although BMW muddies the water (not literally, of course, as these 4x4s never actually get mucky) by referring to its X cars as Sports Activity Vehicles (SAVs).    Adding to the confusion is that number; BMW’s 4s are coupés, but this is a four-door - five if you include the hatch. Confused? We are, but then again BMW could pop a blue and white roundel badge on one of its factory worker’s shoes and there’d be a queue of people wanting to buy it. So the X4 is coupé version of the X3 SUV that’s not, in BMW speak at least, an SUV. At least all the wheels are driven, so should Armageddon come you’ll be decently equipped to escape it. Why else would you want a 4x4, after all?  Only you might want to be a bit circumspect in your packing, as the coupé has a smaller boot. Fifty litres smaller, says BMW. So you’ll have to leave out some emergency supplies and hope normality resumes before your rations run out. Feeding the kids less wouldn’t hurt, mind, as you don’t want them growing too much, as they’ll quickly run out of headroom in the tighter back seats.  First Impressions?  You’ll look good in your X4, as it is basically shaped like a narrower - and not quite so muscular - scaled down BMW X6. And looking good is what the X4 is all about. Being the sportier X model the driving position isn’t quite as high as in its more practical sibling, but it’s still tall enough to enjoy a better view ahead than most.   more motors   How does it drive?  Only diesel engines are offered in the UK, and the new 190bhp 2.0-litre is plenty quick and still efficient. The 3.0-litre is very brisk in standard 258bhp '30d' guise and indecently so in the 313bhp 35d range topper.  In fairness, the lower seating position does help the X4 feel sportier than the X3, and it's a touch more agile than its more practical relative too. Achieving that hasn’t resulted in any significant trade-off in the ride quality; even on the larger 19-inch alloy wheels and firmer suspension that comes with M Sport trim it’s rarely upset by what sometimes passes for roads here in the UK.  The steering is accurate and nicely weighted, the engine's hushed and the eight-speed automatic gearbox does everything you’d hope. It shifts effortlessly and briskly - and I think most people will opt for this.  What it’s like inside?  No real surprises inside. You’re higher than normal, if not as high up as in the X3, although the view out of the X4 is also restricted by its more coupé-like roofline. Still, BMW will sell you an option for that, with parking sensors and cameras all easing the stress in a multi-storey car park.  Few will find the boot space lacking, although headroom in the back does suffer as a result of the X4’s more sporting profile.  Verdict  Here's an SUV that’s not a coupé that’s not a conventional 4x4. The BMW X4 might give out mixed messages, but it’s strangely alluring. Saying that, it’s difficult to justify the £3600 premium it costs over the equivalent, more spacious and less conceptually-confused X3.  Key Facts  Model tested: X4 30d M Sport Price: £46,395 (range starts at £36,595 for xDrive X4 20d SE) Engine: 3.0-litre turbodiesel (entry car 2.0-litre turbodiesel) Economy: 47.9mpg (52.3mpg for xDrive X4 20d SE) Road tax: £180 (156g/km) (£145, 143g/km for X4 20d SE) Service intervals: Variable Service costs: Variable Warranty: 3 years unlimited miles 0-60mph: 5.8 secs (8sec for X4 20d SE) Top speed: 145 mph (132mph for X4 20d SE) We like: Fine drive, individual looks, good performance  We dislike: Less space but costs more, visibility out the back not great.    The rivals  BMW pretty much invented the coupé-esque SUV segment with its genre-busting X6, so the X4 has few direct rivals. If sporting SUVs are your thing the Porsche Macan is a far more engaging drive. Though it lacks the BMW’s rakish profile, passengers benefit with greater space as a result.<|im_end|>

# Think Valentine's Day is only about romance? These funny, sad stories prove otherwise

If you are looking for a gift that will leave your love having all the feels but won't leave your wallet empty, Keri Lumm shares a few ideas. Buzz60 On Valentine's Day, romance is in the air, and for some, that means grab the nearest gas mask. It's not all roses and chocolate boxes for everyone. In fact, there could be a bitter not-so-sweet memory that pricks harder than Cupid's arrow. Telling those funny or sad stories about Valentine's Day isn't the easiest when everyone's solely in a loving mood. But, a few people stepped up to the plate and shared their stories on Fixing York and Facebook, in general. From hilarious to embarrassing and tragic, people poured their hearts out nonetheless. Isn't that what this heart-throbbing holiday is all about? His heart was in the right place "When I was younger I was out and about and I think I was at a market in my hometown and saw this really pretty cloth rose that I wanted to get my mom so I bought it for her with whatever allowance I had had. Turns out it was a pair of sleazy panties folded into a rose." 
—Christopher  An unplanned brunch guest "Me and my best friend and her husband went to a party at a friends house on the 13th, got super drunk so had to sleep over, next morning they had reservations for a nice brunch spot, had to take me along to their date since they were my ride the night before and too hungover to take me home first. At least I had a valentine that year kind of..." 
—Monica  He was temporarily paralyzed  "In 2012, on February 14th, I fell victim to [Guillain-Barré syndrome]. In less than 36 hours, I went from tingling legs to being paralyzed from the neck down. Took months before I could walk again." 
—John  She liked the gift everyone shunned "Kind of funny. One year, my husband got me a vacuum as a gift. And apparently everyone told him how mad I would be. He was about to take it back because he was so worried but I found it before he could. And I LOVED it! I needed a new one and he had listened and got me the exact one I wanted. Everyone that had him worried was shocked when he told them it was one of my favorite gifts." 
—Sara   He ending up spending it alone "It [was] Valentine's Day 2002 [in] San Francisco, Ca. About 2 [months prior], I had met [this] young woman in a Jazz Club. We started to spend a lot of time together and [became] very fond of each other. So, I thought, well... to make a long story short, 
I made this elaborate dinner for the two of us and plans for a night on the town afterwards. Well, she never showed and I haven't seen or heard from her since. Love hurts."

# Wild equipment managers thrown into high gear this time of year

After the Wild finalized a postgame trade with the Golden Knights Jan. 21, the process to acclimate newly acquired defenseman Brad Hunt began before the team even left the airport in Las Vegas.  General Manager Paul Fenton relayed what number Hunt wanted to wear to head equipment manager Tony DaCosta after chatting with Hunt, and DaCosta e-mailed Exclusive Pro Sports, an Illinois-based company that customizes the Wild’s jerseys, to request a No. 77 sweater. He also called his counterpart with the Golden Knights to get Hunt’s specifications for his gear — all before the airplane took off for Denver.  Two days later, when Hunt showed up at Pepsi Center for his team debut against the Colorado Avalanche, a jersey was waiting for him.  “They try to make you feel at home,” Hunt said. “My experience here has been fantastic.”  With less than two weeks to go before the NHL trade deadline, the hockey world will be focused on the GMs orchestrating the deals and the players switching teams.  But these in-season transitions wouldn’t be possible without equipment staffs outfitting NHLers with what they need to represent their new squads, behind-the-scenes shuffling that’s essential to keeping the league operating on schedule.  “People don’t see the work they put in to make us happy,” Hunt said, “to make us be able to do what we do.”  Hunt is among four players the Wild has brought in so far this season, a spike in arrivals from what DaCosta has become accustomed to in the last handful of years.  And with more change possible, the staff is on alert but doesn’t need to change its preparation since it’s primed to handle roster turnover at any time.  “They’re ready for you, and they usually have answers to every question,” veteran Matt Hendricks said. “If they don’t, they’ll get it immediately.”  It’s easier to maneuver at home, but the Wild travels all season long with the essentials to welcome in someone new while on the road.  It has two extra bags, half a dozen pants in different sizes, a variety of gloves and blank jerseys along with name and number kits. Rarely, though, do assistant equipment managers Rick Bronwell and Matt Benz have to sew those details onto a player’s jersey.  Usually, the team can have a sweater mailed in from Exclusive Pro Sports on time — barring it’s not a weekend when shipping is difficult. The company has a batch of Wild jerseys already on hand and once it knows the number, it can expedite the production.  “I want to get their number right away … because I want to get that rolling as fast as I can,” DaCosta said.  Once a trade is completed, a player’s equipment rep will typically reach out to DaCosta to let him know preferences, but he also gets that insight from the player’s previous team since equipment managers share helmet and jersey sizes, skate measurements, whether a player needs more sticks ordered and what’s in his hockey bag.  “We do as much as we can without bugging the player,” DaCosta said.  Players keep their protective gear and once the staff opens their bags, it begins subbing out former team items — like T-shirts — for new ones.  Since most NHLers skate with customized equipment, they usually debut with stock sizes the team carries for gloves and pants until their individualized pieces arrive in team colors — typically in a week to 10 days.  “We just have to get you on the ice,” DaCosta said.  White helmets are reusable, but DaCosta doesn’t like putting shells over pants to cover up a former organization’s colors. And he doesn’t spray paint gloves.  The colors on goalie pads can be tweaked, and masks can be wrapped in a different theme.  “The equipment guys are the unsung heroes of the team,” Hunt said.  Aside from overseeing gear needs, the staff can also set the tone for a player’s introduction to the Wild — acting as an unofficial welcoming committee since DaCosta is among the first from the team to touch base with newbies.  “[If] your first impression when you meet the trainers is a really good one,” coach Bruce Boudreau said, “then you’re already comfortable.”  And making the adjustment as smooth as possible is the equipment staff’s objective.  “It’s tough to be traded,” DaCosta said. “So I’m pushing on the companies to go as fast you can because I want to look good for this player — that we’re taking care of him. It doesn’t matter who it is. That’s your job.”  Short takes  • The Ducks will make their second and final regular-season visit to Xcel Energy Center next week, and they’ll have a different face behind the bench than the last time they were in St. Paul. After dismissing coach Randy Carlyle Sunday, General Manager Bob Murray announced that he would take over Carlyle’s duties — an unusual move for someone who’s never coached pro hockey but one that makes sense for a beleaguered Anaheim squad. Promoting Dallas Eakins from the American Hockey League could alter the chemistry of a team that’s doing well in the minors, and getting a front-row seat to the Ducks’ struggles could help Murray’s maneuvering as he searches for solutions for a team that’s had losing streaks of 12 and seven games.  • Boston will be without leading point-getter David Pastrnak for at least two weeks after he underwent surgery on his left thumb. But Pastrnak didn’t suffer the injury in a game or during practice. He was hurt falling while walking to his transportation after a sponsorship dinner Sunday, a tough accident as the Bruins attempt to hold onto the third seed in the Atlantic Division.  • Sharks center Joe Thornton rewrote the NHL record book Monday, surpassing Gordie Howe to rank ninth in league history in assists with 1,050. Thornton also logged his 1,541 regular-season game, moving by Shane Doan and Johnny Bucyk for 15th place and with 1,457 points, the 39-year-old tied Teemu Selanne for 15th in NHL history.

# Bloomberg preps $500M anti-Trump fund for 2020: report – True Pundit

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is reportedly prepared to spend at least $500 million of his own funds to block President Trump from a potential second term in the White House. Democratic operatives briefed on the billionaire’s plans told Politico that Bloomberg plans to either use the money to fund his own campaign against Trump in 2020 or fuel an unprecedented shadow political party for whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee. “That’ll get us through the first few months,” Kevin Sheekey, a top adviser to Bloomberg, told the news outlet when pressed about the plan. “Mike spent $100 million in his last New York City election. And you can do the math as you think more broadly but New York City is 3 percent of the national population,” he continued. “I’m not suggesting it’s straight math. But I’m suggesting that when Mike Bloomberg is committed to making a difference and seeing something though, generally speaking he’s pretty unabashed in doing so,” Sheekey added. – READ MORE<|im_end|>

# Two guilty of taking part in brawl which left youth covered in blood

Two men have been found guilty of being involved in a brawl which left a youth badly hurt after he was struck with a meat cleaver.  The boy was left with injuries to his head and neck after a brawl broke out between three men and a group of youths at Prestatyn Market in May last year, Caernarfon Crown Court heard.  Griffith denied a charge of possessing a bladed article, a machete, in a public place and Hughes denied affray and were tried at Caernarfon Crown Court.  After a three day hearing the two were found guilty by the jury. Sentence was adjourned until next month for the preparation of reports.  The third man, aged 17, has already admitted to striking the youth with a meat cleaver and pleaded guilty to a charge of grievous bodily harm.  The jury heard evidence from both men during the second day of their trial.  Giving evidence in his own defence Griffith admitted to being in possession of the machete but denied having secreted it in the Prestatyn market area ahead of the fight on May 14 last year.  He said he saw it lying on the ground near a skip and picked it up.  Griffith told his barrister Matthew Curtis he wanted to prevent anyone else from using it. Carrying it away from the area he later threw it into a pond.  Asked by Elen Owen, prosecuting, why he had not alerted anyone to the possibility of a fight Griffith answered again he hadn't thought of doing so.  Hughes admitted being in possession of a metal pole but claimed he picked it up from a hedge in self defence.  Hughes admitted he didn't tell police about the metal bar when interviewed after his arrest.  "I didn't lie but I didn't mention it. I panicked," he told Ms Owen.  The victim, another 17-year-old youth, was due to give evidence but did not attend court. The judge issued a warrant for his arrest for contempt of court.<|im_end|>

# Esports is all set to become a billion dollar industry by 2019-end

It’s a great time to be a gamer. Gaming has come out of the shadows of bigger stars in the entertainment industry, and has finally established itself as a potent force. It was recently reported that the gaming industry is now worth more than the film and music industry combined. Esports, which are competitions based on popular multiplayer games, has been one of the biggest driving forces behind the success of the gaming industry as a whole.  And now a new study reports that the Esports revenue will reach the one billion dollar mark in 2019 according to Newzoo. This is set to be another industry standard for the industry as the revenue and the audience for it has boomed recently. The valuation here has been made using the media rights, advertising, publishing fees, merchandise, and sale of sponsorship and not the player salaries, prize pools, and capital investment.  According to the report, sponsorships account for 42 percent of the revenue while 23 percent is attributed to media rights. The study has also accounted for the most watched games in the world and League of Legends has surpassed everyone in that respect with 347 million hours. LoL is followed by Counter-Strike with 274 million hours watched and Dota 2 comes in third with 250 million hours. And in the fourth place is Overwatch which has 101 million hours watched.  Even though games like PUBG and Fortnite have ruled in terms of popularity and player numbers, they could not break even in the esports arena because these don’t yet have a proper esports community yet. These games are more watched for its streams on Twitch by other players and streamers.<|im_end|>

# Georgia Calhoun honored for her devotion to community

CHOCCOLOCCO — About 50 friends, family and well wishers gathered Valentines Day night at New Prospect Baptist Church to show their love for Georgia Calhoun. Fred Couch said he organized the celebration because she could not attend a Christmas function due to an illness. “Why don’t we do something for her for Valentine’s? Just show her our love? She’s just done things for us and let’s surprise her,” Couch said. Couch went on to a few of Calhoun’s many accomplishments and the lives she has touched. “She started the Jazz Heritage Festival, she started the Black Heritage Festival, she’s been president of the museum, she’s been active on Chamber of Commerce projects,” Couch said. It was like a surprise birthday party as Calhoun walked into the darkened church and discovered well-wishers and old friends, many dressed in red to mark the day. Once Calhoun sat down in the center of the room, Couch said it was time to “boast, roast or toast” Calhoun and her life. Couch asked everyone to speak — accolades, memories and milestones were shared along with plenty of laughter. State Rep. Barbara Boyd, a longtime friend, said Calhoun has been a pillar not only in Choccolocco but also in Anniston. “If I could sing, I’d sing ‘I’ve got Georgia on my mind’, but I want to say that Georgia has always had community on her mind,” Boyd said. “If you give to the world the best you have the best will come back to you. You have given your best, Georgia, and you deserve everything that comes back to you,” Boyd said as the honoree flashed her smile and gratitude. J. Mitchell Rogers from the Community Foundation of Northeast Alabama said he had worked with Calhoun on the Freedom Riders Park. “I want to say that Georgia is the spine of our community. The spine is rarely seen but without the spine the head could not turn or bend,” Rogers said. Yvonne Walker said she moved to the area 10 years ago and met Calhoun, who became a good friend. “She’ll do anything for you. She introduced me to so many people and took me so many places, I just love her,” Walker said. After everyone spoke, Calhoun, 88, reacted to the outpouring of kindness. “Is this my eulogy?” Calhoun asked. Calhoun, who was with her two sons all day, thought the visit to the church was a routine stop (the men were in on the friendly plot). “I thought we were going over to Anniston to a restaurant. I’m the most surprised person you’ll ever see in your life,” Calhoun said.<|im_end|>

# England Lions fall to innings defeat after following on against India A

England Lions fall to innings defeat after following on against India A  Last Updated: 15/02/19 10:38am  Ben Duckett made 50 but England Lions were beaten by an innings and 68 runs inside three days in the second unofficial Test against India A.  Leg-spinner Mayank Markande did the bulk of the damage, taking 5-31, as the Lions were bundled out for 180 in their second innings.  Lewis Gregory was the last man out for 44 but only he and Duckett scored more than 20 as the Lions crumbled to lose the two-match series 1-0.  W Indies vs England  February 22, 2019, 2:30pm  Live on  Having begun the day on 24-0, the Lions lost Max Holden (7) early, lbw to Jalaj Saxena, with Duckett dismissed in the same manner soon after reaching his half-century. Ollie Pope (7) was Markane's first victim and after Sam Hain (15) and Sam Billings (20) were dismissed in quick succession, the Lions were 118-5. Gregory offered some resistance but there was precious little help from the other end as the final five wickets went down in the space of eight overs to seal a comprehensive win for KL Rahul's India A.<|im_end|>

# UK's Saudi weapons sales unlawful, Lords committee finds

The UK is on “the wrong side of the law” by sanctioning arms exports to Saudi Arabia for the war in Yemen and should suspend some of the export licences, an all-party Lords committee has said.  The report by the international relations select committee says ministers are not making independent checks to see if arms supplied by the UK are being used in breach of the law, but is instead relying on inadequate investigations by the Saudis, its allies in the war.  It describes the humanitarian plight of Yemenis as “unconscionable”.  It is the first unanimous report from a parliamentary committee describing Saudi arms export sales as unlawful, and comes ahead of an imminent high court appeal by campaigners to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia on the grounds they are in breach of humanitarian law.  The report places no legal obligation on ministers, but is likely to add indirectly to the pressure on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to seek a way out of the war in Yemen through negotiation, rather than further military offensives to dislodge Houthi rebels in the capital Sana’a and the port city of Hodeidah.  Although a patchy ceasefire holds around Hodeidah, Saudi airstrikes are reported by the Yemen Data Project to be at their most intensive since the four-year civil war began in Saada governorate along the border between Yemen and Saudi Arabia.  The US Congress voted earlier this week to suspend US arms sales to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen, but the White House has signalled the president will veto the resolution if necessary.  The Lords’ international relations committee concludes following a short inquiry: “The government asserts that, in its licensing of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, it is narrowly on the right side of international humanitarian law. Although conclusive evidence is not yet available, we assess that it is narrowly on the wrong side: given the volume and type of arms being exported to the Saudi-led coalition, we believe they are highly likely to be the cause of significant civilian casualties in Yemen, risking the contravention of international humanitarian law.”  The committee also asserts that the UK “should immediately condemn any further violations of international humanitarian law by the Saudi-led coalition, including the blocking of food and medical supplies, and be prepared to suspend some key export licences to members of the coalition”.  It adds it is “deeply concerned that the Saudi-led coalition’s misuse of the weaponry is causing – whether deliberately or accidentally – loss of civilian life.  “Relying on assurances by Saudi Arabia and Saudi-led review processes is not an adequate way of implementing the obligations for a risk-based assessment set out in the arms trade treaty.”  The committee, chaired by the former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Howell, describes the British as supporters of the Saudis in the civil war.  The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has taken up the search for a peace settlement in Yemen as his single most important priority, apart from Brexit, and travelled to Warsaw this week to meet with Saudi, UAE and US ministers to discuss the state of the limited Yemen ceasefire negotiated in Stockholm in December.  The joint statement issued by the four countries following their talks was sharply critical of the Houthis adherence to the Stockholm agreement, but nevertheless agreed to do more to stabilise the Yemen economy in the north.  However, the peers urge the UK to be more active.  The committee, including senior former diplomats, says: “The government should give much higher priority to resolving – not just mitigating – this situation, particularly in light of the tension between its support for the Saudi-led coalition and its role as a major donor of humanitarian relief to those affected by the conflict.”  In its latest update on the war, the NGO International Crisis Group says: “Though the battle for the Red Sea port and city of Hodeidah is paused until the UN-brokered deal to demilitarise the area succeeds or collapses, fighting on other fronts has intensified, particularly along the Saudi-Yemeni border ... Saada governorate has faced more Saudi bombardments than any other part of Yemen since the war began in March 2015, with the majority of strikes taking place near the border.”<|im_end|>

# Man strangles son to death for stealing two pieces of meat

The suspect strangled his 8-year-old son after finding out that he had eaten the meat his wife prepared for him.  According to a report by Daily Monitor, the incidence occurred on Wednesday at their residence in Buwamwibi village, Maefe parish in Maefe Sub-county.  A witness, identified as Ms. Everline Sellah, explained that on the fateful night, the suspect came back home drunk and requested for his meat. He got angry after his son confessed that he ate it.  "I heard when the son told him that he had eaten it and I knew it would annoy him but I did not expect that he would kill him because of meat.  "We thought he was joking but when we rushed there, we found the child dead. He had strangled him to death," she said.  District Police Commander (DPC), Mr Denis Kamugisha, confirmed the incident.  Kamugisha said, "The suspect killed his son after he found out he had eaten his meat kept for him by his wife, who was away when the incident happened. We were alerted and have arrested him."  He added that the suspect has been arrested and will be charged to court for murder after investigation is concluded.<|im_end|>

# Lewis and Chu Request Tax Refund Update

In the wake of reports that millions of taxpayers have been surprised to learn they owe money to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) this filing season, Ways & Means Oversight Subcommittee Chairman John Lewis (D-GA) and Oversight Subcommittee member Judy Chu (D-CA) sent a letter to Department of Treasury (Treasury) Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, requesting additional relief for taxpayers who unintentionally underwithheld their income taxes in 2018. Reps. Lewis and Chu requested that the threshold for relief from the IRS underpayment penalty be lowered to include taxpayers who paid at least 80 percent of their 2018 tax liability.  In their letter, the members pointed out that IRS and Treasury prepared new federal tax withholding tables last year following the enactment of the Republican tax law, the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (TCJA). “As you know, when Treasury and the IRS released these tax withholding tables in 2018, the tables did not fully factor in the TCJA’s reduction in itemized deductions and the TCJA’s removal of personal exemptions,” Reps. Lewis and Chu wrote. “As a result, taxpayers likely had less tax withheld in 2018 than in the prior year.”  The members also cited a July 2018 U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) report that estimated “that 21 percent of taxpayers (nearly 30 million Americans) will owe more taxes in 2019 due to underwithholding,” as a result of the newly-adjusted withholding tables. In addition to asking for relief for a greater number of taxpayers who unintentionally underwithheld last year, Reps. Lewis and Chu also requested “to know what adjustments Treasury and the IRS made to incorporate the TCJA into the withholding calculations for 2019 and what additional guidance Treasury and the IRS plan to issue to address under payments and lower than expected refunds.”  “We do not want taxpayers to be in the same situation again next year,” the members emphasized.<|im_end|>

# ICYMI LSU – Beer in the Box, Revelries rock Varsity Theatre

Welcome back to our weekly roundup of the top stories trending on LSU campus! From Business Students to Bandmates The Revelries. If LSU students don’t know this name yet, then they will soon. A band of current and former LSU students, The Revelries are Beau Bailey, a junior in Business by day and lead vocalist/rhythm guitar in the band by night, and Logan Maggio, lead guitarist, a junior in Finance. Bailey and Maggio are joined by Hoyt Brignac on bass and John Lewis on drums, Lewis having recently graduated from LSU with a degree in Accounting. The band has spent extensive time touring and playing across the US, from big cities like Los Angeles to small towns in Ohio. They have two singles out now, available on Spotify and iTunes, with more on the horizon. Another single is set for release on February 22, and they have recently recorded their debut EP of 6 songs with Grammy nominated producer John Rausch. If you haven’t had the chance to see them yet, check them out at the Varsity Theatre this Saturday for their first headlining show, tickets $10 pre-sale or $15 at the door. LSZULU The countdown is on: 17 more days until Mardi Gras, which means 17 days until one of the most famous parades of the Mardi Gras season, the Krewe of Zulu, rolls into New Orleans. This year, LSU and Zulu have a lot in common. Namely, the Queen of Zulu is one of LSU’s own: Kailyn Rainey, a sophomore majoring in Finance. She will be the youngest queen of Zulu in the past 48 years and will make history as the first LSU student to be queen. In honor of her majesty, Tiger Marching Band will be marching alongside her on the big day. This year certainly is shaping up to be a year like never before for the band- from being recognized nationally for their Binge Watch Halftime show to now marching for the first time in one of Mardi Gras’ biggest parades. Brews and Baseball It’s opening weekend at the box! There’s been some changes at Alex Box Stadium for the new baseball season, and there’s one in particular that will likely be very pleasing to students. The Yard is the two new tented areas that sells beer and wine for those over 21, and wristbands can be purchased for $20 that redeems 2 drinks, only to be consumed inside the tented area. Alex Box is celebrating its tenth birthday, and things have gotten a bit of a face lift. The box now features the largest video board in college baseball, measuring at a startling 2,700 square feet. The season kicks off tonight, with Military Appreciation Weekend with Army West Point, Air Force, and UL-Monroe all coming to play the Tigers. The Comeback Kids  Saved by the buzzer! In the game that was the talk of the town all week, No. 19 LSU beat the No. 5 University of Kentucky Men’s Basketball team on the road Tuesday with a final second tip- in for the win, 73-71. As usual, the game saw an epic comeback from the Tigers that were down 40-32 at the half, and the Tigers ultimately served Kentucky with their first LSU defeat since 2009. The win brings LSU to 10-1 in SEC play and 6-0 undefeated on the road in the SEC, safely securing their spot as No. 2 in the conference. Can we call LSU a basketball school yet? And Then There Were Nine A total of nine LSU students were accused of hazing and battery belonging to the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity and have been arrested. The detailed reports of what happened to pledges while being hazed are frankly disturbing, including several accounts of different tortuous activities involving gasoline, broken glass, cayenne pepper in eyes, ice baths, and so much worse (we’ll spare you the details). These arrests serve as a wake up call that LSU will not tolerate any misconduct in their hazing policies, and the consequences are serious for those who misstep.<|im_end|>

# Our Opinion: Cheers and Jeers -- Feb. 16, 2019

Cheers – A year’s reprieve Maria Immacolata Catholic School has served local children and parents for decades. That long tradition seemed like it was destined to end when Bishop Shelton Fabre announced recently that Maria Immacolata would close at the end of this school year. To the great relief of many in the school community, Fabre reversed himself and gave parents and school officials another year to get its financial house in order. “I think after consulting with the people who were here, I guess I chose to give them another year to see what they can do,” Fabre said at a meeting earlier this week. “They felt they had not been communicated with from the perspective of the parish. They should have known about the financial state of the school. Hearing that they didn’t and believing in their desire to save the school I gave them one more year.” It is good to see the bishop taking these people’s feelings into account and extending the chance to get the school on solid monetary footing. It is also gratifying that there is clearly two-way communication going on among the diocese and the people it serves.  Cheers – A BIG Achiever The Bayou Industrial Group gathered this week for its annual banquet and honored some of members of the local business community. Chief among them is Carol LeBlanc, who received the organization’s BIG Achiever Award. “I’m excited to finally win this,” LeBlanc said. “I was working with Ronald Adams and came to the luncheons with him every month and got interested in the organization. I wanted to join, but it was a rough time getting in because there were no women at that time. I don’t think that the people in the group know how hard it was to get involved in it 40 years ago,” she said. “That’s why I’m glad that the story is being told.” Congratulations to this deserving honoree, as well as to the incoming board members and officers.  Cheers – Outstanding Citizen The Lafourche Parish Council held its own recognition ceremony earlier this week when it named longtime volunteer firefighter Jim Montez the Lafourche Parish Outstanding Citizen. This was the first time the council has bestowed the honor, but it is a fitting one. Montez has volunteered for 45 years for Fire District 3 and was present at Tuesday’s meeting to accept the award with his family. “When it comes to Jim, he’s what we would consider our top volunteer,” District 3 Fire Chief Kully Griffin said. “When it comes to a decision that’s involving the firefighters of District 3, Jim’s opinion is always taken into account, and that goes to show what type of person he is.” Well done, and congratulations.

# Robben claims Anfield to be his “worst stadium”

What goes up must come down.  That’s essentially what Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben said before the German side heads to Liverpool to take on the Reds in Champions League play this coming week.  “You always have your favourite opponent and there always has to be a negative one,” Robben said to The Guardian. “I think, if you ask [about] the worst stadium for me, it’s probably Liverpool.”  Robben had a pair of Champions League heartbreaks at Anfield, both coming with Chelsea in 2005 and again in 2007. In the latter, Robben had a penalty saved by Pepe Reina in the shootout that sent the Reds to the final against AC Milan.  “At that time [Liverpool] were really capable of being this cup fighter team, also in the FA Cup or [League] Cup,” Robben said of those difficult memories. “In one or two games they could really live up to it and perform; just not the whole season, which was maybe too much. That was their biggest quality: they were there at the moment they needed to be there.”  “Now I think it changed and they developed really well. The manager has done a great job.”  Robben is a doubt to even play in the match due to a thigh injury, and that will probably help Jurgen Klopp sleep at night. The German boss saw Robben score nine goals against Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund across all competitions, including the decisive goal in the 2013 Champions League final in the 89th minute.<|im_end|>

# Pakistani court indicts opposition leader in housing scam

LAHORE, Pakistan — A Pakistani anti-graft tribunal has indicted the country’s opposition leader Shahbaz Sharif over his alleged links to a multi-million dollar housing scam in the eastern city of Lahore.  Sharif was arrested in October on charges of abusing power as chief minister of Punjab from 2013 to 2018 by awarding contacts for the housing scheme to those connected to his Pakistan Muslim League party.  The court on Monday also indicted 10 other people on corruption charges in connection with a housing program for low-income citizens.  Sharif and the other co-accused denied the charges. Sharif leads the opposition in the lower house of parliament. He is free on bail pending trial, which starts next week.  His older brother, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was disqualified from office in 2017 over corruption charges.  Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

# How to not get hacked - IT-Online

Gone are the days when we could live in peace believing that as low-profile individuals, we were unlikely to draw the attention of hackers. Any information shared or stored online is now prized by cyber criminals, many of whom make big money targeting ordinary individuals.  “Sold to marketing companies or used to hold people ransom, personal data and browsing history are very valuable. We cannot afford to be careless about what information we share online or with whom,” says head of local hosting company 1-grid.com, Thomas Vollrath. The company specialises in helping small to medium sized businesses get online securely, without compromising their employee or customer data.  Individuals can take precautions to make themselves invisible online, and Vollrath offers these tips:  * Know who you share your data with – only give your personal information and banking details to secure sites that belong to trusted service providers. Check that there is a privacy policy in place that clearly states your data will not be shared with any third parties.  * Avoid public Wifi – it is best not to enter any personal information online while connected to public Wifi networks, including those in coffee shops. Do your online banking at home or on a more secure network, like your phone’s hotspot.  * Enable two-step verification – this is important not just for banking apps, but also your email account. Valuable information about yourself and your work passes through your email account – make sure that it is difficult for hackers to crack.  * Mind the apps – a single app with too many permissions can seriously compromise your data. Think carefully about what information you are willing to share with each app you install.  * Store and dispose of info securely – have strong passwords on all devices that have access to your personal information and accounts. Wipe all data off your laptop and cell phone before giving them away or selling them.  * Keep an eye out for impersonators – phishing schemes impersonate people or companies that you know in order to trick you into sending them valuable information. Always check sender details carefully and never enter information into links you receive via email. Rather Google the company, go to their official site and sign in there – or call customer support to check that the email is legitimate.  * Secure your domain – if you own a domain yourself or for your business, your name, email address, telephone number and physical address is published online in the WhoIs database. You can make this listing secure and private by purchasing security for your domains.  “The internet is an integral part of everything we do – our work, banking, administration and social lives depend on it. Being secure does not require abandoning the online world entirely, but everybody needs to take precautions,” says Vollrath.<|im_end|>

# Guaidó sets up possible confrontation over US aid

Venezuela’s self-declared interim leader has set up a confrontation over US aid by calling for Venezuelans to cross borders and bring it into the country next week.  Juan Guaidó wants a “humanitarian avalanche” and “caravans” to go to the borders to get the aid next Saturday. President Nicolás Maduro says the aid is part of a US plot to disguise an invasion into Venezuela.  The US says Mr Guaidó requested aid because the country was in crisis.  USAID administrator Mark Green said children were going hungry, that nearly every hospital in Venezuela was experiencing medicine shortages and that three million people had left the country.  It remains unclear if the aid will be allowed to enter Venezuela.  US military planes have already delivered aid to the Colombian border town of Cucuta. Mr Guaidó said more aid distribution centres would be opened in the Brazilian border town of Roraima and in the Caribbean.  Outlining his plans for 23 February, Mr Guaidó, who is leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, urged Venezuelans to mobilise en masse in all of the country’s states.  He said aid would enter Venezuela by land and sea and also urged Venezuelans living abroad to demonstrate and for those in Colombia and Brazil to accompany the aid into Venezuela.  In an earlier tweet he said 600,000 people had signed up as volunteers to help bring in the aid and appealed to the military – which has so far remained loyal to Mr Maduro – to “put itself on the side of the people” and let the aid in.

# Cyrus CD6 SE review

We first investigated Cyrus's new 'Servo Evolution' technology, in the context of the £1,100 CD8. It has now been applied to the whole of the Cyrus CD player range, including this new entry-level CD 6 SE which (according to Cyrus) out performs the original, pre-SE, CD8! The idea of Servo Evolution is bold and commendable. In essence, Cyrus has developed its own transport, taking a more detailed view of exactly what goes on at the sharp end of the laser than most hi-fi manufacturers, who incorporate transports purchased as ready-made subassemblies. That said, Cyrus still buy in the mechanics: it's the signal processing that is unique. So why bother? Well, principally because the servo system in normal transports is optimised more towards readability of dodgy discs than the finer niceties of high fidelity. Cyrus reasoned that the customer who pays £900 for a CD player probably takes great care of his/her CDs! And although the proof will be in the listening, we find this kind of design approach admirable. We also rather like the adoption of a slot-loading mechanism, which experience has taught us is actually better than a tray – easier to navigate without looking, while the open/ close button no longer disappears beneath the tray itself. Ejecting the disc a few millimetres more would have helped, though. Audio conversion and conditioning is carried out by good-quality parts, including a 192kHz capable DAC – ironically the chip used by Cyrus for the SE circuit also includes a DAC which, being of lower quality, is simply ignored. This model is not compatible with the PSX-R power supply either, but a lone digital output provides some upgrade potential. Capable performer Another well-balanced and generally very capable performance, with lots going for it in most areas. To the extent that if there was any criticism, it centred on the sound not being quite as large-scale as a couple of the listeners might have wished for, with less of the 'reach-out-and-grab-you' quality that characterised one or two of the other players. Otherwise, comments were pretty much praise all the way. Of particular note is the way this player can offer detail and precision at the same time as rhythmic vitality. This is quite a rare combination: plenty of audio kit can do one or the other, but finding both together is pretty much the Holy Grail of hi-fi. It's only fair to admit that the degree of detail seems (both from our 'blind' listeners' notes and from our own sighted listening) a shade behind that of the Arcam, say, and the rhythmic aspect is not quite on a par with the Unison Research, but the crucial point is that unless comparisons like that are on hand, you wouldn't be aware that the 6SE is missing anything. Musically adept As a result, the thick scoring of Shostakovich is clearly revealed and laid neatly before the listener, while the energy and sheer pleasure in the music-making of The Mavericks comes across quite unfettered. Indeed, that latter track was, perhaps, best served overall by this player compared to others in the test. By identifying each instrument without losing any gusto, the 6SE arguably got closer than any to the soul of the track. Frequency extension is excellent at both ends, with powerful, but still controlled bass and elegantly sparkling treble, while the midrange is very neutral and portrays voices with natural resonance and high intelligibility. Stereo imaging is rock-solid and has very good depth which remains stable with changes in level and texture.<|im_end|>

# An uninspiring economic vision

In January, Lebanon published slides outlining McKinsey’s economic vision—the outcome of a report commissioned by the Ministry of Economy and Trade in late 2017 following government discussions. The 1,274-slide document was developed over the first half of 2018, and outlines an economic vision produced by the consulting firm and owned by the government.  If we consider the country to be a company, we can say that this economic plan has buy-in from three top-level board members—but we do not have clarity on the views of intermediate or upper management, and for that a new cabinet must be formed. There is thus no buy-in at the level of administration or state management. This report would make sense were McKinsey talking to the tiny senior executive management layer of a family-owned corporation, or at best a family-owned rentier state cut from the same cloth as that of certain undemocratic states in the Middle East.  But that is not Lebanon. Despite all the weaknesses of our democracy, such as the disregard for the people’s sovereignty by political bosses or the corruption of unchecked political elites, Lebanon is a democratic state—albeit a democratic state where the public sector does not operate on functional democratic processes. Instead, elected lawmakers negotiate workable solutions for social and economic disagreements between their electorates.  Lebanese democracy enters this period—crucial for not only its growth and future prosperity, but for its very survival—as a state battered by external pressures exerted by foreign powers, with internal dysfunctions reflecting the collusion of politicos who appear to regard society in the same way as a band of horse thieves might regard a herd of mustangs. Even in the best scenario, Lebanese democracy is operated by consociational procedures whereby communities haggle with each other rather than work in the interest of a greater national benefit.  The McKinsey report on an “Economic Vision” for Lebanon appears to be willfully oblivious to this reality. Even as a top-down document, its substructure of “Vision 2025” and “Vision 2035” comes across as a consulting product aimed at owners of a fictitious state, replete with targets for imponderables (such as GDP, GDP volatility, and unemployment rates in 2025 and 2035) that strike knowledgeable readers as blatant figments of the imagination.  McKinsey has not tied its vision to any economic model, and has based it on feeble analytical foundations. Some news outlets have published comments labeling McKinsey’s report a “damning diagnosis”—but it was not a damning diagnosis of our economic state of affairs, it was just a reiteration and accumulation of known numbers. Faced with the report, people who had been free to ignore realities or who were focusing on just part of these diagnostics, can now see the situation as a whole, and do not like the way it looks.  On the other hand, there seems to be only a single opportunity that could come out of this report, and that is the ability to use it as a reference point for further debates over what is necessary and what is needed. We can always say that the Lebanese government, by virtue of their unpreparedness for producing a strategic vision for the nation, outsourced the work to McKinsey; although the consultants produced a long list that may be useless, the fact this work was outsourced demonstrates that one was needed. There is an opportunity for more constructive discussion, and McKinsey’s economic vision, then-caretaker Minister of Economy and Trade Raed Khoury told Executive in a mid-January interview, is the product of the state’s inactivity or non-decision making over the last 30 years.  There are four crucial design flaws in McKinsey’s economic vision, each with implications for its implementation. The first is that the plan is not based on verifiable data, and admits that it is not an economic plan. This economic vision, where it refers to data—whether existing or target data—does not have any kind of fact-checkable veracity, because the fundamental issue in Lebanon is that lack of data means we never know what we are actually talking about. A second design flaw is that there is no understanding of Lebanon’s fundamental economic and social models, an analysis of which is actually what we want and need. A third design flaw is in the methodology and internal coherence of the plan, which offers no measure of confidence that implementation of Recommendation A can be done without any other measure, or that Recommendation C must be implemented after Recommendation B. There is no specification of which measures can be accomplished when and no qualification of what such a specification would be based upon. The final design flaw of the McKinsey economic vision is that the consulting firm has no skin in the game (no accountability), if Lebanon attempts to implement the proposed prescription in the nation’s economy.  Executive reckons that there is much, much more that has to be on the state’s and the public’s agenda for 2019. More understanding of our possible economic futures, more inclusion in our national economic vision, more joint decisions across communities and compromise between divergent interests, and, crucially, more intelligent—well informed—action.<|im_end|>

# Supermarket price hike 'great news' for dairy farmers

Supermarket price hike 'great news' for dairy farmers  THERE is finally some good news for our farmers as Woolworths made a significant announcement today.  The supermarket chain will remove $1 per litre fresh milk in support of a more sustainable Australian dairy industry.  Woolworths' $1 per litre milk will be removed from sale nationwide from Tuesday, February 19.  Coolabunia dairy farmer Damien Tessman said it was "great news" for the industry, which had been short on wins over the past decade.  "Milk went to $1 in 2011, that equates to roughly about 78c in today's money," he said.  "The milk stayed the same price, but costs continue to go up."  Mr Tessman said the move by Woolworths gave a much-needed boost of confidence to dairy farmers.  "This gives the right signals to dairy farmers. It tells them they can be confident to invest and grow their businesses," he said.  "But the job is not done until the other major retailers act."  The move will see the supermarket sell two and three litre varieties of Woolworths branded fresh milk for $2.20 and $3.30 respectively.  Every cent of the increase will end up with Australian dairy farmers.  As the price change goes national, it will deliver higher milk prices to more than 450 Australian dairy farmers supplying into Woolworths-branded fresh milk.  Australian Dairy Farmers CEO David Inall said this was a huge step forward for the dairy industry.  "There is no doubt that this is a game changer in the fight against discount dairy that has long frustrated the industry," he said.  "Removing $1 milk is not just intended to restore farmers' financial confidence, but it will also boost confidence in regional communities and small businesses that rely on the industry."  Now that Woolworths has shown their commitment to assisting Australian dairy farmers, South Burnett's Damien Tessman encouraged Coles to do the same.  "Obviously there is no Coles supermarket in the South Burnett but we can still encourage our friends and relatives in other regions not to shop at Coles," he said.  "This move by Woolworths has proven consumers vote with their wallets."  Mr Tessman said he might even go back into Woolworths after putting a self-imposed ban on shopping at the supermarket giant since the induction of $1 milk back in 2011.  "I do like shopping at IGA, but I will definitely stop lecturing people about why they shouldn't shop at Woolworths," he said.<|im_end|>

# Walmart flexes in the fourth quarter, beats all expectations

Walmart flexes in the fourth quarter, beats all expectations  NEW YORK (AP) - Walmart beat expectations on quarterly profit and revenue, and e-commerce sales surged during the critical holiday period.  Shares moved sharply higher before the opening bell Tuesday.  Walmart is the first major retailer to deliver fourth-quarter results and its performance provides more evidence that efforts to expand services online as well as in the stores are widening the gap between itself and traditional rivals while at the same time, it's holding its own against Amazon.  The huge numbers from the world's largest retailer are especially encouraging after a very weak December retail sales report last week from the U.S. Commerce Department led many to fear that consumers had gone into hiding.  The government data, delayed by a government shutdown, hinted that a volatile stock market, a government impasse, and a trade war with China had taken their toll on the American psyche.  That, at least in Walmart's case, appears to be untrue. Walmart and other retailers are also benefiting from the woes of others. Toys R Us and Bon-Ton Stores have gone out of business, and the list of casualties keeps getting longer. This week, Payless ShoeSource began liquidation sales at more than 2,100 stores in the U.S. and the Puerto Rico. Sears is shrinking and J.C. Penney is floundering.  FILE- In this Nov. 9, 2018, file photo shoppers look at toys at a Walmart Supercenter in Houston. Walmart Inc. reports financial results Tuesday, Feb. 19, 2019. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip, File)  Walmart posted strong sales across a wide range of products from toys to groceries and electronics. That helped sales at stores open at least a year rise 4.2 percent at its U.S. namesake stores, following a 3.4 percent pace in the fiscal third quarter.  Since buying Jet.com more than two years ago, Walmart has been expanding online by acquiring brands and adding thousands of items.  It's also been ramping up grocery delivery and pickup options. Walmart now offers grocery delivery service at 800 stores and grocery pickup at 2,100 stores  Walmart has revamped its website with a focus on fashion and home furnishings. That all helped to drive a 43 percent increase in e-commerce sales in the quarter, matching the pace from the previous period.  Walmart has become a gravitational force online surprisingly fast.  "Pleasingly, Walmart is successfully broadening its online base of customers and is now attracting both younger and more affluent demographics," wrote Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, a retail research firm. "These are early days, but Walmart is now a serious contender in the online space and presents a much more serious threat to Amazon than it did 18 months ago."  The company had a fourth-quarter profit of $3.69 billion, or $1.27 per share. Earnings, removing one-time items, were $1.41 per share, which is 8 cents better than analysts had expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.  The Bentonville, Arkansas, company had revenue of $138.79 billion, also better than expected.  Shares of Walmart Inc. rose 4 percent, to $103.70 in premarket trading.  _____  Portions of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

# Teenage boy stabbed in St Albans

Teenage boy stabbed in St Albans  PUBLISHED: 11:12 19 February 2019  Archant  Two teenage boys have been arrested after a boy was stabbed in St Albans last night.  Police were called at 8.02pm yesterday to reports of a teenage boy being stabbed in The Ridgeway, St Albans. The boy was taken to hospital in an ambulance, but was later released and returned home. Firearms officers, supported by the dog unit and National Police Air Service, made arrest enquiries at addresses in St Albans, London Colney and Welwyn Garden City. A 16-year-old boy from St Albans and a 15-year-old boy from London Colney were arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm, and remain in police custody. Sgt Caro from the St Albans Safer Neighbourhood Team said: “Despite some reports that are on social media, this is not connected in any way with Sandringham School. “This is believed to be an isolated incident where the victim and suspects are known to each other and enquiries are continuing.” Last month a 15-year-old boy was jailed for nine years for stabbing a 16-year-old boy in Verulamium Park in June 2018, resulting in life-threatening injuries. In November, 20-year-old Ahsanullah Nawazai was stabbed to death in Walsingham Way, London Colney, and Carla Callum, 30, from London Colney and Ani Anderson, 20, from London were charged with his murder. Any witnesses who have not yet spoken to police or anyone with information is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary on the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/16207/19.<|im_end|>

# Hamlin: 2019 Daytona 500 triumph 'validates' first win

Hamlin: 2019 Daytona 500 triumph "validates" first win  Denny Hamlin’s 2018 season was dispiriting, but his confidence never lowered.  Hamlin went the entirety of 2018 without recording a single win, marking the first time the Virginia native didn’t secure a victory in a season since he ran a seven-race schedule in the Cup Series in 2005. Now, just one race into the 2019 season, Hamlin is a race winner once again.  After a multi-car accident on Sunday sent the 61st running of the Daytona 500 into overtime, Hamlin took over the race lead on the final restart and fended off Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Kyle Busch and Erik Jones to win his second Daytona 500 in just four years.  “I certainly think it validates the first (win),” said Hamlin, who broke a 47-race winless streak Sunday. “I know it’s not luck, but there’s been a lot of one-time winners of a lot of races, not just the Daytona 500. Sometimes circumstances allow you and almost hand you wins at times. “But, certainly, if you win a couple, that means that’s a skill thing. You’ve put yourself in that position.”  Though the 2018 season was exasperating at times for Hamlin, the 38-year-old driver never lost hope.  “I was still competitive,” he said. “I think we had a string in the middle right when the playoffs were starting. We won like three out of four poles in a row. We were fast. We just struggled in certain situations.  “Some of the greatest drivers had winless seasons – Tony Stewart, Jeff Gordon, those guys. I was never doubting whether I was still capable of winning races.”  An emotional win for J.D.  Hamlin’s win on Sunday was especially emotional for car owner Joe Gibbs, who was still grappling with grief over the loss of his son and the co-founder of JGR, J.D. Gibbs.  It was J.D. Gibbs who discovered a young Hamlin in the early 2000s, who convinced his father to allow Hamlin to drive J.D. Gibbs’ beloved No. 11 car and who continuously bragged to his father over the years about how the gamble they took on Hamlin paid off. On Lap 11 of Sunday’s race, everyone’s minds weren’t focused on the racing. They were diverted to the memory of J.D. Gibbs. On that lap of tribute, countless JGR pit crew members stood on the pit wall and honored the legacy of their late colleague who meant so much to their organization.  And in the first race since his passing last month, Hamlin put J.D. Gibbs’ favorite number, 11, in Victory Lane.  “It's the most emotional and the biggest win I've ever had in my life in anything,” Joe Gibbs said. “J.D. built our race team, was the guy that ran day-to-day operations for 27 years. He invested his occupational life in our race team.”  Given all the circumstances, Hamlin said this win is more special to him than his 2016 Daytona 500 victory.  “I'm taking this one in a little bit more,” Hamlin said. “Everything was just so crazy at the end of the 2016 race with the final lap, how it all played out. I couldn't believe anything that happened. I was in awe the whole time.”  Still seeking the title  Hamlin has built himself an impressive resume in the Cup Series. He was named Rookie of the Year in 2006, was the first rookie in history to qualify for the Chase, won two Daytona 500s, won the 2015 All-Star Race, among countless other accomplishments that will forever be etched in history.  But through all those admiral achievements, Hamlin has been unable to win a championship.  While some may say his career is overshadowed by his inability to win one, Hamlin said his career could end right now and he would still be satisfied with his career.  “I could be done now and be totally content with everything that I’ve accomplished,” Hamlin said. “I’m not going to be burdened by anything hanging over my head of not accomplishing this or that. I’ve already accomplished way more than I ever thought I would. I do this because I’m passionate, I’m competitive and I want to win.”  With another Harley J. Earl Trophy to put in his trophy case, Hamlin has his sights set on other famed races he wants to win.  “The Brickyard 400 is one that slipped away at the end of last year that really pierces me really good,” he said. “I would love to win that one and obviously the Coke 600.”  On Monday, Hamlin continued the renowned tradition of officially inducting his race-winning car inside the Daytona International Speedway Tickets and Tours Building during the annual Champion’s Breakfast. He also helped unveil the 2020 Daytona 500 logo.  “Same time next year?” Hamlin quipped.<|im_end|>

# Aberdeen group's £10million Norway offshore deal

Aberdeen-based Wood has secured a £10 million contract with Equinor to deliver engineering, procurement, construction, and installation services to the Vigdis boosting station increased oil recovery (IOR) project.  It will provide topside modifications to enable the tie-in of subsea equipment to offshore platforms Snorre A and Snorre B, which process oil from the Vigdis subsea field, located in the Norwegian North Sea.  The contract is delivered from Wood’s office in Sandefjord, Norway, and follows the company’s successful completion of the front-end engineering design (FEED) and concept study for the asset. Wood also currently provides maintenance, modification and operations (MMO) services on Snorre A and B under a framework agreement with Equinor.  Dave Stewart, CEO of Wood’s Asset Solutions business in Europe, Africa, Asia & Australia, said: “Wood has a longstanding relationship with Equinor and this contract award further demonstrates their confidence in our offshore modifications capabilities. This new contract also supports our strategic focus on solidifying our position as a modifications service provider in Norway.”  Lars Fredrik Bakke, Wood’s senior vice president in Norway added: “Wood has decades of experience in the Norwegian energy sector. This experience, combined with our local engineering team’s customer specific knowledge of Equinor’s processes and systems, positions us ideally to safely and successfully deliver this contract.”  On completion of the project, production from the Vigdis field will be increased by almost 11 million barrels.<|im_end|>

# Hounds bury chances, Sting

The Soo Greyhounds timing was Swiss-watch perfect on Tuesday. The Hounds scored early in the first period, when Rory Kerins connected just 2:11 in, early in the second, when Jacob LeGuerrier beat Cameron Lamour at the :53 mark, and late in the second period – twice. Keeghan Howdeshell tapped one in on the power play at 19:35 and Mac Hollowell, on a deflected shot, scored with just 1.9 seconds to go in the frame. Despite a shaky third period by the home team, the result was a 6-2 victory over the Sarnia Sting before 3,820 at GFL Memorial Gardens. The makeup game was originally slated for Sept. 21, but was postponed that day when high winds kept the Sting from crossing the Mackinac Bridge en route to the Sault. “It can deflate a team,” said Hollowelll, when asked about surrendering both early and late goals. “We talk about the timing of goals all the time,” added Hounds head coach John Dean, whose club will take a 37-12-6-1 record into Thursday’s scheduled 7:05 p.m. start in Windsor. With 81 points, the Soo is four up on second-place Saginaw (36-15-2-3) in the battle for first place in the OHL’s West Division and also four points back of first-place London (39-10-6-1) in the race for top spot in the Western Conference. All three teams have 12 regular season games remaining. “Starting and ending periods are important times for all teams,” said Hounds winger Cole MacKay, a standout for the winners with a goal and an assist. “It definitely gave us a boost of confidence.” “It’s definitely something we focus on,” Hollowell added, while discussing starting and finishing periods with authority. “Both are important, but definitely good starts in the first are a focus for us.” The goal by Kerins, his first of two in the game, came after the rookie redirected a Holden Wale shot past Lamour. After MacKay’s 24th made it 2-0, the LeGuerrier goal, following a slick play and feed by Morgan Frost, put the home team in control. After Sarnia’s Ryan McGregor scored his first of two power-play goals at 4:20 of the middle frame to make it 3-1, Sting head coach Derian Hatcher was bothered by two slashing minors his club took in the final six minutes. “That really hurt us,” said Hatcher, whose team had beaten Saginaw 7-6 in a shootout at home on Monday afternoon. Howdeshell, with his 38th of the season, and Hollowell, with his 22nd, opened up a 5-1 lead after 40 minutes. “Those are tough to give up, absolutely,” added Hatcher, whose team fell to 24-28-5-2. “That’s momentum for the period.” Dean said he liked the way his team started the game, noting how fast starts are typically a good sign for his club. But while he’ll take the two points, the coach admitted he’d like to have seen “more of a clean game. We weren’t playing the right way in the third period.” That’s when the visitors outshot the Soo 16-7, cutting the Hounds overall advantage to 39-35. “We could have been better,” added MacKay. “We need to do a better job with details and simplifying our game so we’re playing more of a playoff style.” Of the first two-goal game of his OHL career, Kerins said it felt good. “It’s really good to contribute,” added the Caledon, Ont., native, who has eight goals as a rookie. Asked about his first period marker, Kerins talked about how he “got my stick on it in front. I got lucky I guess.” Matt Villalta, making his return to the lineup after missing one game with an upper-body injury, was solid between the pipes. “We gave up some significant chances, but he (Villalta) made it look easy,” said Dean, whose team faces Kitchener on Friday (7:30 p.m.) and Sarnia on Sunday (2:05 p.m.) after opening its trip in Windsor. Howdeshell finished with a goal and an assist on Tuesday while Frost and Wale contributed two assists each. Notes: Captain Barrett Hayton left the game with what Dean said was a lower-body injury after a collision with a Sarnia player near centre ice with just over a minute left in the second period. “He’s legitimately day-to-day,” Dean said. “We’ll see how swollen it is in the next few days.” Howdeshell left the game with 3:30 left in regulation in obvious pain after blocking a pair of shots. “No injury for Howdeshell,” the coach said. “Give him credit for the blocks.”<|im_end|>

# Branson and Maduro Square Off for the Ultimate Battle of the Bands

It’s shaping up to be a battle of the bands like no other.  Last week, Richard Branson announced he would stage a Live Aid-style concert on the Colombian side of the Venezuelan border, near a bridge in Cúcuta that embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has blockaded to prevent aid donations from getting through.  Now, Maduro has announced a rival concert, on the Venezuelan side of a different bridge in Cúcuta that people have been using to flee to reach Colombia, away from his own regime.  Branson said he hoped the concert would draw global attention to the dire situation in Venezuela, where there are severe shortages of food and medicine. He also wants to raise $100 million in aid for the country.  In the process, the British billionaire made himself a powerful ally for Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who declared himself interim president last month following public protests over the legitimacy of Maduro’s re-election.  The Virgin Galactic founder told The Associated Press that the inspiration to host a concert was based on his involvement with Live Aid and with ‘The Elders’, a group of veteran leaders who aim to support peace and human rights around the world. As The Washington Post points out, however, it’s not clear how any funds raised would help Venezuelans, at least until the political stalemate between Maduro and Guaidó ends.<|im_end|>

# 'Breadlines' Bernie Brags He's Forcing the Dem Party Radical Left

Host John Dickerson on CBS This Morning asked Bernie Sanders what his distinguishing characteristic would be. He said he is proudest of pushing the party left.  The Socialist/Communist Sanders says his ideas are now mainstream in the Democratic Party. They have come his way, and he’s proud of it. He is running in part to shift the party as radical left as he can.  Watch:  HE COULD BE THE BREADLINES PRESIDENT  Bernie “Breadlines” Sanders, as mayor of Burlington, praised the regimes of Nicaragua and Cuba—claiming bread lines were a sign of economic health and press censorship was necessary for wartime. He conflated terrorist takeovers with justified wars of self-defense.  “You know, it’s funny. Sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is when people are lining up for food. That’s a good thing. In other countries, people don’t line up for food. The rich get the food and the poor starve to death,” Sanders lamented.   Bernie saw Reagan as a traitor and violent communist Sandanistas and the Castros as gallant revolutionaries.  Bernie said in 1985 that Castro never faced a rebellion in Cuba because he educated their kids, gave them free healthcare, totally transformed the society.  As he praised Castro, he condemned the evil Imperialistic U.S. and Ronald Reagan.  In fact, the U.S. is the only non-imperialist Super Power ever to exist. At that time in history, the US tried to save the world from communism. And now Bernie is bringing communism to the United States.<|im_end|>

# Lebanon double-murder suspect was a former police officer

A former Lebanon police officer and double-murder suspect allegedly acted in revenge to shoot his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend this month, and had threatened her and any man she was dating just two weeks prior, according to court paperwork. Brenton Wade Richmond, 48, is set to be charged with two counts of aggravated murder. The murders allegedly occurred on Feb. 7, according to a court document filed by prosecutors. The deaths weren’t reported until 10:55 a.m. Feb. 9, when the bodies of Tammy Lee Hopper, 42, of Lebanon, and Erik Cody Jacobs, 48, of Independence, were discovered by family members at her residence in the 200 block of Shannon Place. Jacobs was a Seaside High School graduate. The two were found naked in a bedroom of the house. Hopper had been shot three times, including once in the head, while Jacobs had been shot four times, including twice in the head, according to an affidavit for an arrest warrant in the case, filed by Linn County prosecutor Ani Yardumian. Hopper and Jacobs began dating about two months ago, shortly after Hopper broke up with Richmond, the affidavit indicates. The affidavit states that Hopper’s daughter told investigators that “Brenton Richmond had made statements that if he found out Tammy Hopper started dating another man that he would kill them both.” Hopper and Richmond had dated on and off for about nine years, the daughter said. The daughter told authorities that she spoke with Hopper daily and last talked with her on the phone on Feb. 7. On Feb. 8, she phoned her mother, but the call wasn’t picked up. The next day, she sent texts to Hopper stating that if she didn’t receive a phone call, she would call the police, the affidavit states. Instead, the daughter, her fiancé and another family member drove to the house and went inside. The fiancé found the bodies. Authorities also learned that Richmond had gotten a passport for a planned and then-canceled trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, with Tammy Hopper. The Eugene Police Department notified local police on Feb. 9 that Richmond’s blue GMC Canyon pickup had been located at the Eugene International Airport, and that Richmond had flown to San Francisco. He had purchased the ticket the same day. Richmond’s driver’s license and another piece of identification also had been found in a trash can near the airport bathrooms, according to the arrest affidavit. On Feb. 10, Richmond was detained when he presented his passport to a customs officer as he was entering Mexico on foot. Richmond had been issued a concealed handgun license by the Linn County Sheriff’s Office in January, the affidavit states. Richmond’s son told authorities that his father had been quiet, distant and not his normal self in the last month. In 2002, while still a Lebanon Police Department officer, Richmond was involved in a SWAT team standoff in Lebanon after he reportedly threatened to commit suicide. He was ultimately not charged in the incident, the Albany Democrat-Herald reported at the time, because prosecutors determined he had only presented a threat to himself. Richmond, who had been a Lebanon Police Department officer for about eight years, and is the son of former police chief Walt Richmond, resigned from the agency later that year. In 2003, Richmond was arrested by Lebanon police after reportedly firing a handgun in his house. The incident allegedly began when his ex-wife went to his home to pick up their children after a visitation. According to an Lebanon Police Department supervisor at the time, Richmond did not want the children to leave and took the youngest into his house. After officers made several contacts with Richmond, he let the child leave. The gunshot occurred as officers were getting ready to leave the house, the supervisor told the Democrat-Herald.<|im_end|>

# UC Santa Cruz student indicted on federal charges for developing 'Banana Plug' app to sell drugs

A University of California Santa Cruz student accused of developing an app to sell meth, cocaine and other illegal substances has been indicted on federal drug charges.  Collin Riley Howard allegedly created “Banana Plug” and then advertised its illicit services by hanging up posters across his campus. The app, still available on the Apple App Store Wednesday morning, “offered for sale contraband, including cocaine, ‘Molly,’ and ‘Shrooms,’” according to a news release issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.  Customers were also encouraged to make their own requests through the app.  Authorities arrested Howard during a sting operation earlier this month after he unknowingly sold drugs to an undercover Homeland Security agent.  “Upon discovering the posters and application, a UC Santa Cruz police officer, in coordination with the HSI, used the application to request a purchase of marijuana and cocaine and then communicated with Howard via Snapchat to set up the purchase,” the statement said.  An undercover agent made a total of four purchases, buying a range of substances including marijuana, cocaine and more than five grams of meth. At the end of the fourth meeting Howard was taken into custody.  Howard made an initial court appearance Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathanael Cousins, where he was indicted on distribution and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine. He’s slated to return to court Feb. 22 for a bail hearing.  If he is convicted on the charges, Howard faces millions of dollars in fines and at least 20 years behind bars.<|im_end|>

# Oconto Falls woman accused of running down husband with SUV on Christmas Eve

OCONTO – An Oconto Falls woman accused of running down her husband with an SUV on Christmas Eve is facing nearly 20 years in prison. Not-guilty pleas to the two felonies and two misdemeanors filed against Sarah G. Colson, 36, were entered by Judge Jay N. Conley on her behalf at an arraignment on Feb. 14, after she stood mute. According to the criminal complaint, the couple were arguing while driving back home from a family gathering on Dec. 24, and the husband told her to pull over, so he could walk home. The man got out of the vehicle about 8:45 p.m. on State 22 near Cream City Road, about 3 miles west of Oconto and about 10 miles from their residence. After he had walked about 10 to 15 yards, Colson accelerated and struck him with the vehicle. The man’s brother, who was in the vehicle, told a deputy that after Colson had punched the accelerator, she swerved and struck him, sending him flying into the ditch. The brother flagged a passing vehicle and asked the driver to call 911. He was taken to the hospital with bruises to his face and head, abdomen, upper back and knee. Deputies went to the couple’s home and found the vehicle, which had damage to the bumper and hood. They knocked on the door, but no one answered. Just as they were about to leave, the husband was dropped off after his treatment, and let them into the house. While arresting Colson, the deputies had to forcibly handcuff her. Colson was charged with first-degree recklessly endangering safety and aggravated battery, felonies punishable by up to 12 1/2 and six years in prison, respectively, along with resisting an officer and disorderly conduct. A pre-trial conference for Colson, who is being held on $10,000 cash bond, is set for March 14.<|im_end|>

# Stretch your retirement with this tax-saving strategy

Retirees Gene Bloczynski (L) and Eric Vannieuwburg fish from a public dock on the Sacramento River in the Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta in Rio Vista, California September 4, 2013. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith February 20, 2019  By Gail MarksJarvis  CHICAGO (Reuters) – Retirement strategy is about more than just how you will spend the money you have saved – it matters where that money is coming from too.  Bill Reichenstein spent his career teaching finance and creating strategies that help people maximize the amount coming from Social Security. The Baylor University finance professor is a principal in Social Security Solutions, Inc., a software firm that helps people work the system.  But since Reichenstein, 66, retired a few months ago, he has been thinking about how to orchestrate the rest of his retirement accounts and he came up with a plan.  Each year until he is 70, he will convert some of the money that is in his IRA and 401(K) accounts into a Roth IRA. He will pay income tax on whatever he withdraws, but once the money is in the Roth, he never will owe on it again, as the growth is tax-free.  Reichenstein figured out that the conversions will give him more than a couple hundred thousand dollars more than he would have had for retirement because of those tax savings.  At a recent Financial Planning Association Conference, Reichenstein urged financial planners to get retirees in their 60s to adopt the same practice; especially if they have put virtually all their retirement savings into 401(k)s and IRAs.  The driver for this strategy is to protect as much money as possible from taxes that can jump sharply after age 70-1/2. This is when individuals are required by the government to withdraw prescribed sums from IRAs and 401(k)s each year and pay taxes on the distributions, known as required minimum distributions (RMDs). Roth IRAs are not subject to these requirements, and also have easier rules for heirs.  “It makes most sense [to convert] when you quit working and before starting Social Security,” said David Oransky, a certified public accountant and financial planner who serves on the American Institute of CPA’s Personal Financial Planning Executive Committee.  For example, Frank Corrado, a Holmdel, New Jersey financial planner and president of the Alliance of Comprehensive Planners, is helping a retired couple do Roth conversions every year for 12 years before hitting 70 and starting Social Security. The couple had adjusted gross income of $141,105 when working, but after retiring at 58 it dropped to about $69,600 as they live on pensions and investments.  With their relatively low income now, they are in the 12 percent tax bracket and can stay within it even though they are converting $32,000 a year to Roths. Over the 12 years before age 70, they will convert about $384,000 of their original $2 million IRA into a Roth. During retirement that should leave them with about $50,000 more to spend, Corrado said.  MORE SAVINGS  The tax saving is about more than just income. Social Security benefits are taxed each year based on a retiree’s other income. So if a person must take a large withdrawal from an IRA, his income will rise and likely lead to more taxes on Social Security benefits.  Medicare premiums are affected too. Most people pay $135.50 a month to have Part B Medicare coverage for doctors and medical tests. But after an individual’s income goes above $85,000 or a couple’s over $170,000, the premium jumps to $189.60 a month per person. As income rises, premiums become as high as $460.50 a month.  During tax season, Oransky suggested thinking about conversions and finishing them the following November when annual income is clear. But people who are planning to move from high tax states to no-income tax states in retirement, may delay a conversion until after the move.  (This story corrects that he will finish conversions at 70, not retire then in paragraph 4 and corrects Oransky’s title in paragraph 8)  (Editing by Beth Pinsker and Susan Thomas)<|im_end|>

# Grab driver in S’pore hits on passenger via WhatsApp after ride, pick-up line fails

Grab driver in S’pore hits on passenger via WhatsApp after ride, pick-up line fails  Picked up the passenger literally and figuratively  Striking up a conversation on WhatsApp is a great way to get to know someone.  It’s also a great way to reject people, because you don’t have to do it to their faces:  This low-risk method might be one of the reasons why people continue to use the platform to suss out potential mates.  Grab driver in Singapore trying his luck  Like this Grab driver in Singapore recently, who decided to drop his passenger a line after the ride.  Unfortunately for him, the passenger shared a screenshot of the one-sided conversation on Instagram Stories, as she disapproved of the after-ride interaction:  The pick-up line is lacklustre and presumptuous, to be honest.  After-ride interactions  Another point that this incident bought up is the ethics that drivers ought to adhere to post-ride.  While GrabHitch drivers get in touch with riders via their mobile phone numbers directly, full-time Grab drivers communicate with passengers via the app:  This means that passengers will not have to reveal any personal contact information to the drivers, and perhaps, as a firewall to protect both parties from unnecessary interactions.  How did the driver get her number?  In this case, the Grab driver tossed his the pick-up line at the passenger via WhatsApp, and the encryption notice suggests this is the first instance of communication between the two parties on the chat platform.  This indicates there were no previous messages coordinating the ride, as hitch drivers and riders are wont to do.  Of course, there is a possibility that they might have previously communicated through phone calls.  However, it is not known if the passenger might have given her number to the Grab driver previously, or if the Grab driver is a full-time driver who had somehow gotten hold of his passenger’s number through other means.

# Will former President Barack Obama attend Duke-North Carolina game?

Duke University officials have increased security with the likelihood that former President Barack Obama will attend tonight's game against archrival North Carolina in Durham, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter. Obama was the talk of Tuesday's news conference with the teams, with Duke's R.J. Barrett thrilled about the possibility of the former president possibly attending. "If he comes, I'm going to be very excited," Barrett told reporters. "This is a legendary game. Many people want to watch. It's going to be a great game." USA TODAY Sports confirmed other reports that Obama planned to appear at the game, although his attendance was not certain. ESPN's Jay Williams and a local ABC11 station reported that Obama was likely to attend. Duke officials have not confirmed his attendance. The Tar Heels (20-5, 10-2) are looking to upset the heavily favored Blue Devils (23-2, 11-1) in the first of two clashes in the next three weeks. Behind Barrett and projected No. 1 NBA draft pick Zion Williamson, Duke is currently the top overall No. 1 seed in USA TODAY Sports' latest bracketology. North Carolina is a projected No. 2 seed. Obama has close ties to UNC coach Roy Williams and often favored the Tar Heels in his NCAA tournament picks while he was president. “I never know who is coming,” Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski told reporters Tuesday. “I try not to let that be what I’m thinking of. Look, anybody can show up here because it is a bucket-list thing. It’s a bucket-list just to come to a game in Cameron. But Duke and Carolina at Cameron is one of those great sporting events. So we can expect anything here." Tipoff for the game is 9 p.m. ET on ESPN, and tickets were nearing the price of Super Bowl tickets.<|im_end|>

# Quiet LSU ready to make some noise

Will Wade almost won a Southern Conference championship during his second and final season as the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga men’s basketball coach in 2015. In his second season at LSU, a Southeastern Conference title is there for the taking. After winning games last week at Kentucky and at Georgia, Wade’s Tigers are 21-4 overall and 11-1 in the SEC lead, a half-game behind league-leading Tennessee. LSU will host Rick Barnes and the Volunteers this Saturday afternoon, following Wednesday’s matchup with visiting Florida. “We haven’t really talked about it that much,” Wade said Monday when asked about the conference chase. “We’ve talked about giving championship-level effort with championship-level habits. We’ve talked more about ingredients that go into what would become winning the SEC. “Our guys are certainly aware of things and where things stand. When we were getting on the plane after we beat Georgia, everybody was walking past me and had their phone on the Tennessee-Kentucky game and were watching that.” Kentucky’s 86-69 win over Tennessee has resulted in essentially a three-horse race for the SEC title, with the 11-2 Wildcats just one game behind the Tigers and Vols with five contests remaining. Incidentally, those three programs are the winningest in league history in regular-season championships, with the Wildcats having earned 48 and with Tennessee and LSU having won 10 apiece. “I think everybody wants to win their conference, and I don’t think there is any doubt about that,” Barnes said Monday. “That’s why we play these games. It’s important in terms of continuing to grow your program and the notoriety it brings to your program. “There are a lot of benefits to it.” Kentucky last won the SEC in 2017, with Auburn and Tennessee sharing last season’s crown. LSU’s last regular-season title occurred in 2009, with the Tigers struggling to a 62-94 league record throughout the nine seasons that followed. Wade, a Nashville native and Franklin Road Academy graduate, inherited a UTC program that went 13-19 during the 2012-13 season and went 18-15 in 2013-14, earning him SoCon coach of the year. His second UTC team went 22-10 overall and 15-3 in league contests, finishing a game behind Wofford. Between his stints with UTC and LSU, Wade guided Virginia Commonwealth for two seasons that yielded a 51-20 record with two NCAA tournament trips. LSU was coming off a 10-21 season that included a 2-16 SEC record when Wade took over in the spring of 2017. His Tigers were picked to finish last in the SEC during the 2017-18 season but went 18-15 overall and 8-10 in league play and competed in the National Invitation Tournament. His second season in Baton Rouge began with last September’s shooting death of junior forward Wayde Sims and an October appearance at SEC media days in which he defended his program against recruiting allegations. At the candlelight vigil for Sims, Wade said, “We’re going to be playing for Wayde all season long.” LSU was picked to finish sixth in this year’s SEC race, but the Tigers have benefited from a league schedule in which the five teams they have to play twice — Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia and Texas A&M — are a combined 21-39 in conference play. The Tigers have not been as dominant as the Vols or Wildcats, with Tennessee owning 10 double-digit SEC wins compared to seven by Kentucky and just four by LSU. The Tigers have spent most of this season under the radar, but last week’s 73-71 triumph at Rupp Arena has changed that, as has a No. 13 ranking in the latest Associated Press poll, the program’s highest in a decade. “Kentucky and Tennessee deserve the headlines,” Wade said. “Kentucky has been the bell cow in the league for a long, long time, and Tennessee won the league last year. I told our guys coming into this season that we’re a team that is not going to get the benefit of the doubt, because we haven’t been in the mix very much lately. “All we can do is go about winning and do what we do.”<|im_end|>

# Trump administration ends California talks on auto emissions: White House

By David Shepardson and Valerie Volcovici WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has formally ended talks with California over federal plans to roll back fuel economy rules, the White House said on Thursday, setting the stage for what could be a lengthy legal fight over the state's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. California could be joined in any court fight by 12 other states that have adopted its standards and want stricter rules to fight climate change. Several other states have also demanded the administration abandon its August proposal to freeze federal fuel efficiency standards after 2020 and take away California's ability to impose stricter emissions rules. The administration has said tighter emissions controls would make automobiles too expensive. "The administration is moving forward to finalize a rule later this year with the goal of promoting safer, cleaner and more affordable vehicles," the White House said in a statement. California has been allowed to set state standards that are stricter than federal rules under an exemption granted by the Environmental Protection Agency. The administration wants to revoke that waiver, saying California should not "dictate" policy for the rest of the country and arguing that another law preempts California from setting its own vehicle rules. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the administration's decision to scrap the talks was a sign of its "weakness and fallibility." "California and states throughout America are prepared to defend our national Clean Car standards even if the Trump administration intends to go AWOL," he said in an email statement. California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said the end of negotiations was "unfortunate." General Motors said it was "disappointed" that the talks ended. GM, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles generate most of their global profits from U.S. sales of large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. All three have discontinued or plan to drop small and medium-sized sedans from their lineups, making it harder for their fleets to meet tighter emissions standards. "We continue to prioritize the need for one national program and remain hopeful that the parties can find a solution to achieve this goal," GM said, adding it was committed to "an all-electric future." The Alliance of American Automobile Manufacturers urged the talks to continue. "One national program is worth striving for because it is the best way to maximize fuel economy and carbon reductions while preserving vehicle affordability and employment," the group said in a statement. "We encourage everyone to keep focusing on how we get there." An administration official familiar with the negotiations said California had failed to compromise. Instead, the official said, the state insisted on sticking with tougher Obama-era mandates and would only offer a short extension in applying them. The official also said California "demanded" that the federal government "surrender" authority to set emissions and economy standards for the rest of the country. Trump escalated his administration's power struggle with California on Tuesday, when the administration canceled $929 million in federal funds for a California high-speed rail project. The state's governor complained that was retaliation for California leading a 16-state coalition challenging Trump's national emergency to obtain funds for building a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Obama-era rules would require automakers to roughly double average fuel efficiency by 2025, sharply reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, which is linked to climate change. It was one of that administration’s most significant climate policy actions. Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, one of 13 states that had adopted California's standards, said he was "deeply disappointed" by failure of the talks. "Repeatedly, I have urged this administration to strike a deal with the State of California and seize the win-win opportunity to keep the American auto industry globally competitive and create more good paying jobs here at home while protecting our environment," he said in a statement.

# Glover Quin asked out of Lions contract before 2018 season

Allen Park — If Glover Quin had his way, he wouldn't have played for the Detroit Lions in 2018. In his first comments since his release, the veteran safety explained his mindset from the past offseason to "The Pride Podcast." "I really don’t want to have to start over, again, in another different direction in Detroit," Quin said. "I kind of felt like I’ve done what I can do, they’re going to start with a new coach, let them start fresh with another player and let me go. "I actually tried to get out of my contract going into the season. I knew it was going to get to this point. I knew it was going to happen. I understand the business of football. ... I was just trying to stop it before it even got it started." Quin said he never expected Detroit to let him out of the two-year extension he had signed the previous year, but he owed it to himself to ask. His hope was to catch on with a team closer to his family in Houston, possibly even a second stint with the Texans. "My family lives in Houston and I was really missing being around my family," he said. "If I’m going to have to start over with a new coach anyway, let me see if I can re-sign in Houston. Yeah, I’ll have to start over with a new coach and everything, but at least I get to come home every day and see my wife and see my kids." Quin also said the lack of recognition he received for his 2017 season, one of his best, took a toll on him. After forcing seven turnovers and falling just short of his career-high in tackles, Quin received glowing marks from analytics site Pro Football Focus, but was only named a fourth alternate for the Pro Bowl, behind the likes of Kam Chancellor, who had been limited to nine games due to injury. It was too much for Quin, who found the entire process disrespectful. When the league eventually called to invite him to participate as a replacement in the annual all-star game, he declined. That combined with a coaching and scheme changes in Detroit, took a lot out of him. "Did I really want to go through all that? It just wasn’t good," Quin said. "I tried to fight through it, come back and play. Dealing with the new coaches, didn’t go the offseason program, I needed a break. I needed time to get myself back together." Skipping the voluntary portions of the offseason program put Quin behind learning the new scheme and he was never able to recover. He finished last season with a career-low three pass breakups and didn't record an interception for the first time in seven seasons. The Lions released Quin last Friday, a move he expected, and one that cleared more than $6 million in cap space for the franchise. The veteran was appreciative the team made the decision early, giving him ample time to consider his future in football. As for retirement, that decision hasn't been made. The 33-year-old safety is open to listening to offers, and if there's one that makes sense for both him and his family, he's willing to continuing his career. jdrogers@detroitnews.com Twitter: @Justin_Rogers<|im_end|>

# Letter: Fact-checking needed fact-checking

Editor: As a longtime resident who has followed the letters section for over 30 years, I’ve only found two occasions to submit a letter to the editor. Here goes number three. Our “Hate Trump” couple from Rotonda are at it again, and this time the author who bashes Trump for lying (and I agree he’s a liar), tells a few whoppers of his own, hoping to score points in his deranged political world. “The stock market rise of 25 percent pales next to the 250-300 percent during Obama’s term in office." Does this mean he wants to compare two years of the Trump presidency stock market returns, to eight years of Obama stock market returns? That’s exactly what the quotes says. Sounds like a fair comparison. President Obama’s eight years in office allowed for a cumulative stock market increase during that time of approximately 119 percent, quite honorable, I’d say, but a little short of the authors claim of 250-300 percent. Perhaps he’s hitting the medical marijuana a little too hard. Next subject is the deficit. ”The deficit has gone up $2 trillion in the last two years, the fastest at any time in our history.” Really? The federal deficit under Trump has unfortunately increased approximately $1.44 trillion, not good. Do you really want to know how much the deficit increased in the first two years of the Obama presidency? Try $2.7 trillion. I could go on, but I’m trying to stay under the requested 250 word limit. Your grasp of the facts is pitiful at best. Randy Wojcik Englewood<|im_end|>

# Jussie Smollett Staged Attack for a Salary Bump, Chicago Police Say

Empire actor Jussie Smollett faked a widely publicized attack on himself in an effort to increase his salary on the hit show, Chicago police said Thursday.  Smollett surrendered to authorities earlier after being charged with one count of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He both faked a letter using racist and homophobic language, mailing it to the Chicago studio where Empire is filmed, and paid $3,500 to two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack, said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.  Smollett was “dissatisfied with his salary,” said Johnson, and “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career”. Authorities say the two brothers who staged the attack are cooperating in the investigation.  Smollett has, thus far, stuck by his story, saying he was attacked when he went to buy food late at night in downtown Chicago, adding that one attacker told him “this is MAGA country”. Initially, he received a wave of support, but suspicions began to grow when police could find no video footage of the attack.  Police are now calling on the actor to publicly apologize for the tale.  “Empire actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger to promote his career,” Johnson said. “I am left hanging my head and asking why? Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile? How can an individual who has been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?”  Police aren’t the only ones demanding an apology. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to react to the news as well.  Smollett faces up to three years in jail and fines if convicted. Fox Television has not yet commented on the matter.<|im_end|>

# BMW to Hire 2,000 People for EV Production at Dingolfing

As deadlines for the launch of a new range of electric vehicles inches closer, BMW is speeding up its efforts to align the manufacturing capabilities of its plants to the new requirements. In Europe, one of the carmaker’s most important production hubs is the one in Dingolfing, Germany. With an output of 330,000 vehicles last year (9 percent of which plug-in hybrids), the facility is the place where the iNext will be manufactured from 2021.  
 To support the addition of the new model to the production lines – it will join the existing plug-in hybrid models from the 5 and 7 Series – BMW announced this week it will hire over the next few years some 2,000 new personnel. 
 “The BMW iNEXT brings together all key automotive technologies: it is fully electric, fully connected and highly automated,” said when making the announcement Ilka Horstmeier, the plant’s newly appointed director. 
 “It is the technology flagship for the future of the entire BMW Group. And we are proud that this car of the future will be built here at our plant.” 
 The model will be the first electric Bimmer in the new lineup to roll off the lines in Dingolfing. No details about the car’s capabilities are yet known. 
 iNext in prototype form is currently undergoing winter testing in the Arjeplog region in Sweden. Engineers are looking into how the car’s various systems - the electric motor, the high-voltage battery, and the cooling systems – perform in sub-zero temperatures. 
 How the car will look remains a mystery as well, despite BMW making public a few photos of the prototypes on location at the polar circle, and despite the reveal of the Vision iNext concept last year. 
 What is known is that the car is an SUV, meaning it is built on a long wheelbase to provide plenty of interior room.

# Customers say Bartlett travel agency turned travel dreams into billing, booking nightmares

BARTLETT, Ill. (WLS) --  They were supposed to be dream vacations, but travelers said they turned into billing and booking nightmares. Now some customers are fighting for full refunds. Consumers are filing police reports and Bartlett police said they are investigating the travel agency. The I- Team has also learned that the business's license could be revoked pending a hearing, all due to complaints from some residents who say they lost money. Christine Stein said she thought she pre-paid for a group trip - an escape to tropical paradise Cabo San Lucas - through her travel agent. But there was a development when they arrived. "We weren't responsible for this, but we felt responsible because our friends went to her," Stein said. "What do you do, they're your friends." She said her group was stunned when they were told upon check-in that they had to pay more. "I was like 'what do you mean we each owe $700?' I went to the front desk and we owed $7,000, for 10 of us, we owed," Stein said. After coughing up the extra dough, which the hotel said was the "remaining balance," Stein said she wanted a refund from her travel agency, Ultimate Travel in Bartlett. "We look forward to this every year with our friends," Stein said. "She ruined it for me, she really did." Stein filed a police report in October stating that Ultimate Travel was in the process of refunding the $7,000. Stein said she did receive several refunds; the only money she said she's owed now is about $500 in credit card interest. An attorney for Ultimate Travel blamed the resort for the error and said Stein is "believed to be fully credited, yet this customer is demanding interest ...a demand that is unsupportable and exorbitant." Erin Simpson also filed a police report about her pre-paid family trip. "There are seven of us, we have five children, my husband and I," Simpson said. "I went crazy, I was mad." Simpson said when they arrived in Cancun, Mexico, there were no reservations for junior suites, which were supposed to be reserved "Then they told me they would give me standard rooms. That's when I got upset and said, 'I paid for junior suites, why would I get standard rooms,'" she explained. Ultimate Travel helped move them to a sister hotel, but Simpson told police they still ended up with standard rooms and had to pay $527 more. Ultimate Travel's attorney contends that Simpson's complaints "center around a hotel upgrade charge which was between the hotel and Simpson." Deb Hanahan also complained about a trip she booked, saying, "It was trip to honor my recently deceased father and my whole family was going to go over to Scotland that was where my dad was born." Hanahan's said Ultimate Travel offered her a deal to change four of her flights to first class, but told her she'd have to pay more money up front on her credit card. They said she'd be refunded the difference of the four coach tickets initially purchased. Hanahan said she never received that refund of $3,000. "If she couldn't get me my $3,000 that she said she was giving me as a credit in August, how do I have any faith she would ever come through with the actual tickets?" she said. So Hanahan checked in with the airline, and said they told her the flights were not booked. "I might have actually gotten to the airport in July and found out we had no tickets, imagine that. That would be even be crazier," Hanahan said. Hanahan also filed a police report and is disputing the entire amount charged to her credit card, about $9,000. "I want everything canceled, I want you to refund my money, I'm done." she reiterated. "And that was November 14th and I haven't seen a dime." There are five complaints filed with the Better Business Bureau, which gives the company an F. There are four filed with the Illinois Attorney General's office. Ultimate Travel's attorney said, "The fact that a consumer filed a complaint with the BBB or AG does not mean or suggest that the assertions are accurate or actionable" Knowles also spoke to Jean Romulus, another angry customer, who he asked if he felt he paid double for his trip. "I did, I did pay double for the trip," he said. Romulus said he too was offered a better deal on a Cancun trip, but he'd have to pay about $1,800 more on a new credit card and then he says ultimate travel would reverse $2,036 which he initially paid. "I don't have $2,036 dollars; I mean it took us like months to save that much," Romulus said. Ultimate Travel's attorneys said Romulus had been fully credited. Romulus is fighting back, saying he was credited in separate disputes but not the $2,036 initially charged. He also filed a BBB complaint. The I-Team emailed and called Ultimate Travel, and stopped by the business. It was closed, so they went to the owner Kelli Kosiek's house. A man who identified himself as her husband stopped to talk. Jason Knowles: "Will she come out and talk to us?" Man: "No." JK: "Why not?" Man: "Because that's what her lawyer told her." Ultimate Travel's attorney sent a letter to the I-Team saying consumers did not understand the credit process, stating refunds are "controlled by the credit card company and at times the actions of the customer." Bartlett police said they conducted a search warrant in December at Ultimate travel. The travel agency's attorney said just because a search warrant was conducted doesn't mean a crime was committed. The attorney also questioned the motivation of the police investigation. If you are using a travel agent to book you may want to independently check on your flights and hotel before you go.<|im_end|>

# Sierra Leone hopes for an end to FIFA suspension - Journal du Cameroun

Sierra Leone is looking forward to an end of Fifa’s suspension ahead of a year-packed with football competitions.Abdula Rahman Swaray, Acting General Secretary of the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA), said on Friday that how soon the country’s suspension is lifted now depends on the actions of the government and the outcome of a court case involving two former SLFA officials: the suspended president Isha Johansen and her General Secretary Chris Kamara.  The suspension of the two prompted Fifa’s decision to suspend Sierra Leone in October 2018. That came following a protracted disagreement among football stakeholders. Mrs Johansen was elected SLFA president back in 2013 as the first female to hold the position.  But much of her tenue was spent fighting with a faction within the football community who accused her of corruption and maladministration. At some point she had a tough time with the former administration of President Ernest Bai Koroma, which had help seen her elected into office.  	Due to the problem, serious football could not be played in Sierra Leone for the next four years. 
	Last year, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) unsealed an indictment of 10 count charges of corruption and abuse of office against Johansen and Kamara. The ACC went further to evict the two from office, in line with the country’s anti-corruption laws. 	Fifa, which had constantly supported Johansen throughout her tenue, suspended the country in line with its policy of non-political interference in football. A high powered government delegation, among them the Vice President, the Chief Minister and the Minister of Justice, held talks with Fifa 



	officials in Zurich, Switzerland, as part of efforts to reverse the suspension. Although that meeting ended in a disappointment for many Sierra Leoneans, officials said it was a success. The delegation and Fifa signed a MoU which detailed actions to be taken before the country will be reinstated. According to Mr Sawara, a very important thing that came out clearly in that MoU is the highly contentious issue of Johansen’s unconditional reinstatement was removed from the table.  He said Fifa said that if the matter in court was concluded it might consider lifting the suspension ahead of its congress slated for this May in Paris, France. “The delay,” he said, “is not Fifa again,” said Mr Swaray.  “Our faith is in the court and the government,” he added in a radio interview. Sawaray said the suspension has had an adverse effect on football in the country, leaving the FA particularly financially handicapped. According to the SLFA official, despite the ban, there has been a lot of encouraging signs between the FA and Fifa. He said the world football governing body has been engaging the FA in a lot of competitions in terms of communication.<|im_end|>

# World Court to issue opinion in Chagos Islands case on Monday

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The World Court will issue an advisory opinion on Monday on whether Britain unduly pressured Mauritius to give up the Chagos Islands, which now houses a major U.S. military base, in exchange for independence in 1965. The case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), as the World Court is officially known, is seen as a test of whether colonial-era deals struck between great powers and small states were legitimate, given the power imbalance. The Chagos Islands, now home to the Diego Garcia U.S. military base, is at the center of a bitter dispute between Britain and Mauritius. Mauritius said it was forced to give up the remote archipelago to gain independence during the decolonization process. Britain maintains the Indian Ocean nation gave up the Chagos islands willingly. After gaining the islands in the early 1970s, Britain evicted almost 2,000 residents to Mauritius and the Seychelles to make way for the U.S. base. For years Chagossians have dreamt of returning and have lobbied the UK government to let them do so. In 2016, Britain’s Foreign Ministry extended Diego Garcia’s lease until 2036, and declared the expelled islanders would not be allowed to go back. While the ICJ’s advisory opinions are not binding, they carry great weight under international law as the ICJ is the United Nation’s highest court for resolving disputes.

# Alcester told to maintain focus by joint-boss Seeley - Stratford Herald

JOINT-BOSS Matt Seeley has warned Alcester Town that they cannot afford to take their foot off the gas if they want to secure promotion from Midland League Division Three.  Despite thrashing FC Shush 5-1 last Saturday, Seeley is expecting high levels of performance from his players and is calling for even better this Saturday when Alcester make the trip to 11th-placed AFC Church.  “Even though we won 5-1, we could have scored even more with the chances we wasted,” Seeley told the Herald.  “In the final third we just looked like we were relaxing and not really going for the jugular.  “I said to the lads at half-time that we have to keep our focus and not rest on our laurels otherwise it could come back to bite us on the backside.”  Although AFC Church sit 11th in the table, Seeley says he won’t be taking anything for granted.  “I’ve got a lot of time for AFC Church as I know a lot of the people there and are good friends with them,” said Seeley.  “We will go to Church with the strongest possible squad to keep our run going.”  Daniel Carter bagged a hat-trick in the win over FC Shush, taking his tally for the season to 18 goals in nine games.  Callum Debar and Callum Burston-Keeley were also on the scoresheet.<|im_end|>

# Children’s book of the week: The Midnight Hour by Benjamin Read and Laura Trinder

When stroppy Emily, still angry after a row, listens in on a conversation between her parents, an adventure begins in which she learns that her annoying mother and quiet father are much more interesting and heroic than she imagined. Pursuing them into a magical Victorian London where it is always midnight, she meets monsters and dangers. The best thing about the book is that Emily reacts to everything like a gobby modern girl — sarcastic, incredulous, defiant — and her meetings with allies and villains can be laugh-out-loud funny. It adds to the tradition of quests in magical worlds, with its larger-than-life characters of an Irish family, a library as a seat of power, satire of many kinds, and a youthful policeman with pointed ears behaving like…  You are currently logged out Get one month’s free unlimited access Unlock quality journalism on the topics that you decide matter most.

# Neil McCann expects Rangers to sell Alfredo Morelos | Sportslens

Former Rangers midfielder Neil McCann expects the club to cash in on Alfredo Morelos at the end of this season.  The Colombian has been in red hot form this season and there will be plenty of suitors for him.  Speaking to the Herald Scotland, McCann revealed that the Rangers striker will fetch a substantial fee and the club will have to cash in eventually.  Morelos is Rangers’ best player right now and replacing him won’t be easy.  The 22-year-old has scored 27 goals in all competitions for Rangers this season and a player of his calibre is unlikely to join the Scottish giants usually.  It will be interesting to see what happens at the end of this season.  Steven Gerrard has said in the past that it will take a lot of money to prise the Colombian away from Ibrox.  Morelos certainly looks ready to make the step up and if clubs from England come calling, he will be tempted to force a move.  If he can control his temperament going forward, Morelos has all the tools to become a top quality player in future.<|im_end|>

The Attorney General’s Chambers has corrected the errors in the two summonses filed on his behalf as part of the appeals of two of the judgements delivered by Chief Justice Roxane George-Wiltshire on the validity of the no confidence vote against government. Stabroek News understands that the corrected summonses were filed in keeping with a commitment made to appellate judge Rishi Persaud on Wednesday. The Chambers said in a press release issued on Thursday that the matters have been filed and that the appellant, Attorney General (AG) Basil Williams SC, anticipates a hearing date in the coming week. The Chambers did not release a copy of the corrected documents. Justice Persaud on Wednesday informed all the interested parties that he could not commence the hearing of the summonses since the information on them was erroneous. In one case, a second appeal was filed with the correct information but the initial appeal, which was defective, was not withdrawn…..<|im_end|>

# Singapore's Indian community pays homage to CRPF personnel killed in Pulwama terror attack

More than 200 members of the Indian community here have paid homage to the CRPF personnel killed in the recent Pulwama terror attack. The Indian diaspora held a candle light vigil on Friday in memory of the killed soldiers. Representatives from Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs were present at the vigil, which was held at the Indian High Commission's Grange Road Complex near the business district here.  India's High Commissioner to Singapore, Jawed Ashraf, said this spontaneous outpouring of grief and support for the killed paramilitary personnel reflected a deep sense of anguish in the Indian diaspora globally. The UN Security Council has strongly condemned the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which left 40 securitymen dead and many injured. The Foreign Minister of Singapore Vivian Balakrishnan has sent a letter to External Affairs Minister of India expressing condolences for the victims and condemning "this senseless act of terror". Singapore maintains a strict stand against terrorist activities being a hub for global businesses, officials said.

# FG approves first-class treatment for 'Baba Suwe' at LUTH - News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)

By Taiye Baiyerohi  Babatunde Omidina popularly known as ‘Baba Suwe’ has been admitted at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) in Idi Araba, Lagos.  Mr Bolaji Amusan, the National President, Theatre Arts and Motion Pictures Producers Association of Nigeria (TAMPAN), disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Lagos.  Amusan popularly known as ‘Mr Latin’ as his stage name said that the development was as a result of the approval of the association’s appeal to the Federal Government to foot the medical bill of Baba Suwe.  He said the ailing veteran comedian who was alleged to be suffering from an unknown sickness had been promised a first class treatment by the Federal Government at LUTH.  Amusan said that the Minister of Health, Prof Isaac Adewole, had made arrangements for the comedian to be treated while the Federal Government will foot the medical bills.  Amusan said, “Myself and other association members have just taken Baba Suwe to LUTH from his residence .  ” I want to appreciate the minister for this gesture, we are happy that our colleague will be back on his feet after a comprehensive treatment.  ” He is receiving first class treatment and we feel so honoured.  ” I also thank the Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, for his generousity, having donated N1m toward Baba Suwe’s treatment.  “I also thank everyone who had made donations toward our appeal for him, we can’t appreciate them enough.  ” As the new president of the association, the welfare of my members is paramount on my mind which I have determined to improve within my four years’ tenure,” he said.  NAN efforts to confirm the admission of Baba Suwe as a patient from the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of LUTH, Mr Kelechi Otuneme, was not successful as he did not pick calls made to his mobile phone.  NAN reports that the ailing comedian had been soliciting financial support to enable him seek urgent medical attention.  Some of his colleagues in the industry had made generous donations coupled with the Vice President of Nigeria, Prof Yemi Oshibajo who donated N1m.  The comedian began his acting career in 1972 but came into limelight after he featured in a movie titled ” Iru Esin “, a film produced by Olaiya Igwe in 1977 and had produced several Nigerian movies.  His career, however, nosedived in 2011 when the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) arrested him for allegedly trafficking in substances suspected to be hard drug.  The allegation that was described as false and defamatory by the ruling of a Lagos High Court.<|im_end|>

# St. Joseph’s boys’ and girls’ basketball teams suffer district semifinal losses — but seasons not over yet

St. Joseph’s Catholic Academy suffered two tough district losses Saturday night in both boys’ and girls’ basketball.  The No. 2-seed girls’ team opened the night at home with a 51-41 loss to No. 3-seed Purchase Line in the District 6 Class A semifinals. The No. 2-seed boys’ team then lost 78-75 in overtime to No. 3-seed Juniata Valley in the district semifinals.  Despite the losses, however, the Wolves’ seasons aren’t over just yet.  Because three District 6 teams qualify for the Class A state tournament, both the St. Joseph’s boys’ and girls’ teams will play another game Tuesday to decide whether they move on to states or spend March from the bleachers. Both the boys’ squad and the girls’ group will take on the same opponent school in Blacklick Valley on Tuesday at a neutral site.  Sign Up and Save  Get six months of free digital access to the Centre Daily Times  #ReadLocal  “It’s unfortunate we couldn’t close it out, but the bright side is we just keep playing,” boys’ coach Richard Ciambotti said.  On the boys’ side, SJCA seized the early advantage with a 33-28 halftime lead. But Juniata Valley chipped away at the lead and, with a tie game and less than eight seconds left in regulation, SJCA let a floater go from the paint — and watched it bounce in and out.  In overtime, SJCA trailed by three in the final seconds and missed a desperation trey to force a second overtime.  “My message to the team was that I love them and I’m proud of them, and I had such a great time with that group in our building,” Ciambotti said. “It’s been a special ride with these eight seniors.”  Jack Mangene paced St. Joseph’s with an impressive double-double of 21 points and 16 rebounds. Cameron Khoza added 16 points, and Brendan Scanlon had 15.  No girls’ information was provided to the CDT.<|im_end|>

# Bangladesh commandos kill purported hijacker of Biman Bangladesh plane

By Serajul Quadir DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh commandoes shot and killed a purported hijacker who had tried to enter the cockpit of a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight on Sunday, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing, airline and aviation authority officials said.  The purported hijacker, who told the pilot he had a personal issue with his wife and wanted to speak to Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, died when the commandos stormed the plane at Chittagong's Shah Amanat International Airport, officials said.  Recommended Slideshows PHOTOS: What's Brewing in Steamy Hallows, the Harry Potter-Inspired Cafe19 Pictures All of these celebrities have had their nudes leaked 36 Pictures "We tried to arrest him or get him to surrender but he refused and then we shot him," said Major General S M Motiur Rahman of the Bangladesh Army. Before the commandos moved in, all 142 passengers and most of the crew had been let off the aircraft unharmed. One crew member had been kept as a hostage, the officials said.  Air Vice Marshal Nayeem Hasan, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh, said the man appeared to have a pistol and had explosives around his body. It was not immediately clear if the pistol or the explosives were real.  The man appeared to be in his 20s, was probably Bangladeshi as he was speaking Bangla, but his identity was not yet clear, the officials said.  The Boeing 737 aircraft was scheduled to go from Dhaka to Dubai via Chittagong. The purported hijacking happened after it had taken off from Dhaka.

# Christian Bale’s Weight Gain For ‘Vice’ Is One Of Many Transformations During His Career

Christian Bale made an astounding transformation to play Dick Cheney in Vice, a role which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Bale is almost unrecognizable in the film but this isn’t the first time that he’s made huge changes to his body for a role. Here are are some of his previous movie transformations.  American Psycho (2000)  As Vanity Fair notes, for American Psycho, Bale had to bulk up to play banker turned murderer Patrick Bateman. Bale looked absolutely ripped in the film and easily conveyed the neurotic pride that the character had in his physical body. Mental Floss reports that Johnny Depp was originally suggested for the role but today it’s hard to imagine anyone other than Bale doing it.  The Machinist (2005)  While American Psycho saw him add muscle to his frame, The Machinist forced him to lose a drastic amount of weight. Men’s Health reports that to prepare for this role, his diet consisted of an apple, water and coffee every day. According to IMDB, He eventually dropped to about 110 pounds to play a man whose life is ruined by chronic insomnia. The actor reportedly wanted to lose an additional 10 pounds but the producers forbade him from doing so, fearing for his health.  American Hustle (2014)  This might have been the most enjoyable transformation for the actor. To play the film’s lead con-man, Irving Rosenfield, Bale had to get fat which meant eating a lot of junk food.  “I ate lots of doughnuts, a whole lot of cheeseburgers and whatever I could get my hands on,” he said in one interview, as reported by Men’s Health. “I literally ate anything that came my way.”  Batman Begins (2005)  Men’s Health reports that Bale had just 6 months to become Gotham’s caped crusader. He had previously become dangerously emaciated for The Machinist so this meant another complete physical transformation. Bale worked with a personal trainer who helped him beef up his frame and there was lots of weightlifting and binge eating involved. Bale’s tendency to take things to extremes made things more difficult, though, as he reportedly became too big for his Batman costume.   — VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) February 23, 2019 Whether Christian Bale wins the Academy Award for Best Actor remains to be seen. But, according to Gold Derby, his chances look good. They have him pegged as the actor who’ll take home the trophy in that category, ousting their previous pick, Bradley Cooper. Bale has previously won a Golden Globe for the role and nabbed a Critic’s Choice Award as well.  Oscar night has been known to deliver surprise wins, so we’ll just have to wait and see.   Christian Bale is known for extreme body transformations — but putting on 40 pounds for ‘Vice’ finally caught up with him pic.twitter.com/1Sre4nUbZH  — NowThis (@nowthisnews) February 23, 2019<|im_end|>

# Opinion: There is a wonder-drug that all schools should be prescribing

MORE THAN 200,000 Irish secondary students have now participated in the Irish Life Health Schools’ Fitness Challenge, making it the largest ever study on the fitness of teenagers in Ireland.  We have conducted the challenge in secondary schools for the last eight years, and have analysed the results since 2011.   Alarming trends are emerging.  The first is the large drop in the number of children participating in the fitness challenge after Junior Cert.  The latest results reveal that participation in the Schools Fitness Challenge drops by a staggering 80% after third year.  Nearly 9,000 13-year-olds participated in 2018 compared to a meagre 1300 17-year olds.  A wonder-drug  It is baffling that we still don’t understand the importance of fitness for children’s long-term brain health and academic performance.  There are several international studies which show that exercise reduces stress levels, improves concentration and positively impacts academic performance.  The findings from a 2014 study that tracked over 80,000 students found that children who significantly improved their fitness over a five-year period also improved their academic performance compared to children whose fitness levels did not change.  Parents need to appreciate the strong link between childhood fitness and physical and mental health.  Exercise should be viewed as medicine. Indeed, if exercise could be prescribed as a pill, it would be the most prescribed drug on the planet, and many parents who write excuse notes for PE are denying their children access to this ‘wonder-drug’.  Detrimental  Another major concern is the decrease in fitness levels among girls from first year to sixth year.  There has been a steady increase in the number of 16 to 18-year-olds who are not meeting the minimum level of fitness required for optimal health.   A low level of cardiovascular fitness is related to an increased risk for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, some forms of cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and non-alcohol fatty liver.  Considering that most health behaviours such as smoking, physical inactivity and alcohol consumption are adopted by the age of 20, and track into adulthood, every effort should be made to promote physical activity and cardiovascular fitness among teenagers.  To do otherwise is simply detrimental to their physical health.  The challenge  The Irish Life Health Schools’ Fitness Challenge clearly demonstrates that a short-term exercise intervention significantly improves the cardiovascular fitness of children.  Since 2013, we have found that girls and boys who participate in the six-week fitness challenge improve their fitness by an average of 10%.  Because of poor health literacy, many adolescents fail to see the connection between their health behaviours and their current and future health.  A new innovative health science curriculum in secondary school is urgently needed. The curriculum should ideally combine elements of home economics, physical education and human biology and should require each student to develop and update a health portfolio throughout their time in secondary school.  The rise of consumer health wearables has the potential to provide today’s ‘digital native’ teenagers with personalised data for monitoring their health and forming positive lifestyle habits.  Involve them  The key to making change is to involve teenagers in the design and implementation of physical activity initiatives for schools.  PE and sport have negative connotations for many students, especially girls, who after junior cert tend to disengage from the school PE program and lose interest in structured sport type activities.  Teenage girls prefer to participate in unstructured activities which are fun, enjoyable and which they can do with their friends. Even a couple of 15 minutes ‘play’ or ‘active’ sessions during a school day where they have the freedom to get up and move in the way they want would make a significant impact on their health.  Perhaps the girls will tell us they don’t want to play soccer but they would be open to Aerobics or Zumba – if that is what they say we need to listen. Aerobics or Zumba classes could be rolled out easily in schools with online instructors.  With a little planning and imagination, school timetables could be planned so that children have to walk to a different area of the school between certain classes. All movement counts.  The aim is to help develop physical activity habits which will continue into adulthood, so a simple walk between classes at school can be a step for encouraging children to move regularly throughout the day.  Prevention is better than cure  It is stating the obvious, but prevention really is better than cure.  As a nation, we need a paradigm shift in our approach to ‘healthcare’.  Instead of managing the implications of lifestyle-related chronic diseases, we should place a much greater emphasis on preventing people from getting sick in the first place.  With research consistently showing that cardiorespiratory fitness is one of the best indicators of current and future health, surveillance of cardiorespiratory fitness should be mandatory in secondary schools.  We must remember there is ‘no one size fits all’ when it comes to physical activity and it is important that young people are exposed to activities that they enjoy.  Young people who are the least active and most unfit will obtain the greatest improvements in fitness and health by starting to participate in regular physical activity.

# Zambia : FAZ confirms Sven's March departure

Sven Vandenbroeck’s last game as Zambia coach will be against Namibia in March, the Football Association of Zambia has confirmed.  Vandenbroeck was handed a nine-month deal to steer Chipolopolo to the 2019 AFCON finals that he failed.  The Belgian has one win one draw, two defeats in the 2019 AFCON qualifiers from his five games in charge with the only other win coming in a friendly on September 11 away to Gabon that Chipolopolo won 1-0 in Libreville.  “We wish to advise that Mr. Sven’s contract comes to an end in March 2019 and will NOT be renewed,” FAZ general secretary Adrian Kashala said.  “Mr. Vandenbroek’s last assignment as Zambia national team coach will be the AFCON 2019 Group K game, between Zambia and Namibia to be played on March 23, at which we expect nothing but a resounding win over Namibia.”  Meanwhile, Zanaco coach Mumamba Numba and Green Buffaloes head trainer Aggrey Chiyangi have bounced back to the Chipolopolo bench and will be Vandenbroeck’s assistants in his farewell dead-runner match.  But FAZ has dropped long-serving assistant Kampamba Chintu.<|im_end|>

# Next Wave #892: Thyla

Brighton; famous for it’s pebbled beach, sticks of rock and also the prospect that every individual you brush shoulders with on the promenade is a potential member of your new favourite up and coming band. The buzz in the small seaside town is eternally effervescent, however the bulk of musicians spilling out of its borders makes it difficult to find the diamonds in the rough.  Presenting Thyla, a post-punk-pop quartet birthed from the beach who are set out to diffuse the confusion between alt-rock and the new romantic. Fronted by Stateside songstress Millie Duthie and compiled of Danny Southwell, Dan Hole and Mitch Duce, the outfit began churning out ditties in 2016, citing inspirations such as indie staple Bombay Bicycle Club and the ethereal queens of Warpaint.  After securing support slots for Sunflower Bean and Fickle Friends (amongst an array of festival billings), the four piece are igniting waves as rapturous as the ones against the helter skelter by the pier. In a civilisation where our eyes are superglued to the shiny brick in our palms and every passing thought that crosses our brain has to be shared on the social media stratosphere, Thyla are taking a stand against the norm that is frazzling our creativity, privacy and most importantly, our minds with their latest release.  “The title of our EP ‘What’s On Your Mind?’ is the prompt Facebook gives you to write a status. All of the songs on our debut, in some way, talk about the ills of today’s social network,” Millie explains, “the lyrics are based on negative personal experiences and a subsequent thirst to understand what it is that has made us so miserable”.  Knowing that each and every one of us has had that bead of sweat rolling down our foreheads after a hefty night out on the tiles when we realise we’ve documented our extensive warbling to Shania Twain on karaoke, the constant fear of how we are being projected online consumes us like the amount of Jagerbombs we regrettably did on top of that.  “There’s pressure everywhere online to project your thoughts and feelings about pretty much everything. It’s self fulfilling, the more you give away, the more you feel compelled to give away. The social network feeds off of individuals’ social anxiety by introducing a point scoring system of likes and shares that creates a competitive market for the mundane; a virtual playing field for status. It’s made the private public and we’re all obsessed!”  “Combining their shimmery melodies with grunge-laden lyricism, Thyla’s striking style is refreshing, whilst also subconsciously educating us on the doomed future of the digital age. “We willingly categorise ourselves to win the social game at the expense of real thought and genuine conversation”, explains Millie. “Today, the written word trumps the spoken word and the art of conversation has suffered. There is such a huge discrepancy between what people say and how people act online compared to what they would say and how they would act in person, we know in ourselves this is the case but we’re selfishly addicted to the lie, we just put up with it.”  “There’s no escaping the digital age, but it’s important to hold it to account for how shit we feel a lot of the time. We should respect ourselves enough to go for that piss we’ve needed for the last hour or to look left when we’re crossing the road before we incessantly check our god damn Instagram!”  Alongside the release of their hotly anticipated debut EP, the band are about to embark on their first headline tour with New York City’s punk extraordinaires Bass Drum of Death. “We love touring; being on the road is probably our collective favourite part of band life. We’ve got some awesome shows lined up this year, including our UK headline tour, we have slots at Live at Leeds, Hit the North and we’ll be making our debut at SXSW in March!” gushes Millie.  If a burst of fuzzy, encapsulating and most of all, eye-opening, music is something that tickles your pickle, then Thyla are the ones for you. “'What’s On Your Mind?' is our first collection of songs to come out at once and we don’t plan on slowing down our output. Writing has been and will continue to be key for us this year. It’s what we love to do, the pressure is on and we’re up for the challenge.”  - - -  - - -  Photo Credit: Cole Flynn Quirke  Join us on Vero, as we get under the skin of global cultural happenings.

# Winning bidder gives basket to ‘Frozen’ fan

Winning bidder gives basket to ‘Frozen’ fan  When Hailey England was guarding the ‘Frozen’ basket at the annual Family Promise Cookie Sale, little did she know someone was watching her watching the basket.  The ‘Frozen’ basket was one of the silent auction items that was a part of the cookie sale, held at Holy Cross Lutheran Church. The annual event benefits Family Promise.  “When the church notified the highest bidder, Karen Blaker, that she had won the basket, she told the folks at the church that she wanted the little girl who had been patiently checking the bids to have the basket,” Polly Hupp, Hailey’s grandmother, said. “What a wonderful act of kindness from a stranger.”<|im_end|>

# Questions raised about LeBron's A/R work before big game at Warriors

Some have often wondered aloud, what would it have been like if twitter had existed when Michael Jordan was gambling in Atlantic City long into the wee hours of the morning before a playoff game against the Knicks?  And it appears that we have some kind of answer, even if it’s not as scandalous, at least as it relates to the scrutiny of LeBron James. After LeBron openly wondered about the commitment of his teammates to the game of basketball, some Lakers fans are questioning the commitment of James himself.  A Lakers fan, who goes by @TheMMQBL on twitter, made the observation that LeBron James’ highly publicized A/R work on the upcoming 2Chainz album, ‘Rap or Go To The League,’ happened the night before James was ruled out of the Lakers Saturday night primetime matchup against the Warriors.  LeBronWire has gone back to the original source video on 2Chainz’s instagram and confirmed that it did indeed say his studio session with 2Chainz happened on Feb. 1 and went until at least 11:43 p.m., the night before the Lakers went to Oakland to face the Warriors on Super Bowl Weekend. James was eventually ruled out only a few hours prior to the game for “load management.”  Now while the videos and stories in question are certainly more bad optics for LeBron after what he said on Saturday, it’s also important to note that James had just played over 40 minutes in an overtime win over the Clippers on Jan. 31, his first game in over five weeks.  But again, those facts probably won’t matter to the most passionate Lakers fans. The look is bad enough to create plenty of doubt in their minds about James’ own commitment, no matter how great he plays if the Lakers continue to lose.  The only thing that James can do to win those skeptical fans over is to win and win a lot over the final 23 games in order to get the Lakers to the playoffs for the first time since 2013.<|im_end|>

# Chorley "boy racers" could have cars seized in new zero tolerance police crack down

Police are launching a zero tolerance crack down on "boy racers" in Chorley.  Under new enforcement powers, police will be able to seize any vehicles suspected of being involved in anti-social behaviour in the town's car parks. Police are targeting "boy racers" after a surge in complaints from the community. In recent weeks, dozens of vehicles have been seen descending on Chorley's car parks for late-night "car meets", followed by reports of anti-social behaviour. But as of Friday, February 22, Friday Street and Portland Street car parks will be actively monitored by CCTV on a 24-hour basis. New signage in the council-owned car parks was unveiled on Friday morning, warning drivers that "careless or inconsiderate driving will not be tolerated in this area". Lancashire Police said the new CCTV will be monitored 24/7 and footage could be used as evidence against offenders under Section 59 of 2002 Police Reform Act. It is part of a wider police crack down on anti-social driving in the area after a number of incidents in recent weeks. A police spokesman said: "Lancashire Constabulary have the power under section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002 to seize vehicles being used to cause alarm, distress or annoyance to members of the public." Chorley Council added: "With help from Lancashire Police, new enforcement powers are being deployed on Friday Street and Portland Street car parks this weekend to tackle anti-social behaviour. "Both car parks are being monitored by CCTV and offenders will have their vehicles seized."<|im_end|>

# Hands On With HoloLens 2: It's an AR Game Changer

BARCELONA—After using it, I can tell you that Microsoft's HoloLens 2 is the most amazing thing at MWC19. The new augmented-reality headset busts through the limitations of the first-gen HoloLens and brings virtual objects into the real world in a compelling, easy way.  I've had a bunch of HoloLens demos over the past few days. First, I tried the video-collaboration app Spatial on a HoloLens 1. Then, I repaired a machine using PTC's Vuforia on HoloLens 2, and tried out the HoloLens 2's basic software shell.  The difference in experience between the two models is massive. Spatial is an amazingly cool app that lets you collaborate with co-workers' photo-realistic avatars in virtual rooms. You can throw PowerPoints on the walls and work on 3D models together. (You can also overlay avatars on top of real people, which is reminiscent of a particularly creepy scene in Blade Runner 2049.)   But on HoloLens 1, you're constantly squinting and turning your head to see what's going on through a very small window. Spatial's 3D audio helps: even if you can't see a co-worker, you hear their voice coming from the correct direction and you can turn your head to find them. But it's perpetually a little frustrating to look around, see the room filled with interesting information, and only be able to see a little of it at a time.  HoloLens 2 changes that. The wider field of view means you can actually see enough of what's going on to be able to work, and the much lighter headset is easier on the neck. Being able to freely push buttons and manipulate objects is another game changer.  Microsoft engineers pointed out that apps will be able to use eye-tracking information as well, which could translate into more lifelike avatars with which you could actually make eye contact. In the demos I saw, eye tracking was mostly used to scroll through instructional text while your hands were busy; when you're repairing a gear (HoloLens users seem to be perpetually on the verge of repairing a gear in some kind of industrial equipment), you don't want to have to let go of anything to turn the page in the instruction manual.   With HoloLens 2, I walked easily around a room, spotting holographic objects, picking them up and moving them. They respected walls and tables, but not gravity: you could stick one in mid-air and look at its bottom, but not force it through a wall. I didn't have to squint or tilt my head or use an artificial pinching motion. Things felt just close enough to real.  I've used Magic Leap, too, and other industrial AR glasses. HoloLens gives you more. The experience isn't perfect. Rotating objects in space was just a little bit trickier than I had expected, and of course the 52-degree field of view doesn't actually take up your whole field of vision. But wow, this is the best thing of its kind by a long shot.  It's insanely frustrating to not be able to show you what I saw, because what I saw is so amazing. I can only say: I've been coming to this show since 2005, and I'm a little jaded. I never wait on lines anymore. I see a lot of phones. HoloLens 2 was worth the 45-minute wait.  Holographic, Not 5G  I sat down with Greg Sullivan, Microsoft's director of communications for mixed reality, to chat about the HoloLens. Greg and I go way back; he used to head Windows Mobile development when new Windows Mobile versions were the big event at MWC . I'm saying that because HoloLens feels like Microsoft's next-generation operating system. It feels like Microsoft leapfrogged out of the smartphone era into the next one, and HoloLens 2 might be its Windows 3.0.  This being MWC, though, it was a little weird that nobody around Microsoft was talking about 5G. "High bandwidth, low latency network connections will be leveraged by mixed-reality intelligent edge devices," Sullivan said. "You could call MR a killer app for these high-bandwith, low-latency networks."   The real killer app there is remote rendering. HoloLens 2 holograms look good, but they're still a little pixelated, and the Vuforia CAD renderings were a bit schematic. That's fine; they got the job done. But by streaming remotely rendered objects (ideally for Microsoft, through an Azure cloud service), they can get to essentially infinite resolution, limited only by the 2K screens you're looking through. 5G would let you do that anywhere.  For now, though, HoloLens uses Wi-Fi 802.11ac, not even the new ax, based on the capabilities of its Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 PC chipset. That's just about development time; Qualcomm has a newer chipset, the 8cx, but HoloLens 2 has been in development for a while. I wouldn't be surprised if HoloLens 3 had 5G.  Will Consumers Ever Go Holo?  HoloLens costs $3,500, but that's not crazy the way Huawei's $2,600 folding phone is, because Microsoft has very carefully scoped this for businesses. PCMag is primarily a consumer publication, though, and you're probably a consumer, so I asked Sullivan when HoloLens becomes a consumer product.  "I think it's measured in years … not decades," Sullivan said. But there are a lot of things between HoloLens and broad consumer adoption: Microsoft's unique optics engine, the cost of the materials, and—possibly most importantly—a design that makes sense in a work context and doesn't look weird if you wore it on the street. Microsoft isn't interested in creating "glassholes," the mocking moniker for people who wore Google Glass out in public.  "Over time, you achieve economies of scale that drive the cost of production down and enable you to deliver the same tech to consumers at a more affordable price point," Sullivan said.  HoloLens will be available later this year. Sullivan didn't want to get more precise about when, but he promised that this won't be a "by Christmas" kind of launch. Microsoft will prioritize major business customers and software developers for its initial lot of units. I suspect there's going to be a back-order situation.<|im_end|>

# Spotify -1.3% as U.S. mulls music licensing change

WSJ sources say U.S. Justice Department officials are considering overhauling two longstanding music licensing rules opponents say unfairly disadvantage artists and limit the ability of publishers to create own deals.  The rules involve the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and the Broadcast Music, the dominant performance-rights organizations that license about 90% of U.S. music for songwriters and publishers. The groups administer public performance rights to music, and let businesses obtain blanket licenses covering large catalogs of music.  Supporters say the rules, which go back to 1941, created a stable marketplace for music licensing and changing the rules could disrupt the industry.  The Justice Department is expected to call for public input in the coming weeks.  Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) shares are down 1.3% pre-market as the streaming giant could suffer from any higher music licensing costs. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), down -0.3% pre-market, could also feel a sting from the rule change.  Now read: Apple: Stress-Valuation » Subscribe for full text news in your inbox<|im_end|>

# Niko Papakonstantis for Exeter Select Board

To the Editor: The upcoming Select Board election in Exeter offers us the opportunity to return the experience and wisdom of Julie Gilman to the board while also bringing on a new board member. It is my hope that our new board member will bring fresh energy and a broadly informed outlook to the role. I believe that Niko is that person. I worked closely with Nikko on Exeter’s Budget Recommendations Committee and saw first-hand how he works with others. He is, above all, a listener. He seeks out and takes time to learn the needs and viewpoints of all parties involved in or affected by a decision. He anticipates conflicts and works to bring people together to work out differences and avoid unnecessary and time-consuming public confrontations. Niko is a team builder. He will strive to bring coalitions together and create a sense of unity on the board. Finally, I want to emphasize that Niko is a family man. He and his wife are involved in youth athletics. They actively support the needs of families. Exeter needs young families. We can attract them with the right kind of community - the kind of community Niko seeks to build as a member of The Select Board. Francine S. Hall Exeter<|im_end|>

# Several UGA Players Expected To Shine At NFL Combine | Valdosta Today

VALDOSTA – With the NFL Combine starting this Friday, UGA has a lot of players that will open some eyes.  Most noticeably to show out is defensive back, Deandre Baker. He was a star at UGA and is expected to easily be picked in the top ten in the NFL Draft.  Two other players that will get people talking after combine workouts is wide receiver, Riley Ridley, and tight end, Isaac Nauta. They are tremendous route runners and can catch anything that comes near them. Ridley is the younger brother of Atlanta Falcons wide receiver, Calvin Ridley. It would be pretty cool to see them face each other or even play on the same team in the NFL.  Other UGA players that are very underrated that will be at the NFL Combine are Elijah Holyfield, D’Andre Walker, Lamont Gaillard, Terry Godwin, Jonathan Ledbetter and Mecole Hardman.

# All the road closures in place for Massive Attack's Filton gigs

Road closures have been announced in Filton ahead of two huge Massive Attack shows to take place later this week.  Thousands of concert-goers are expected to descend on the area for the gigs, with the closures put in place to protect residents from excess traffic, and ensure the safety of marshals working to direct visitors.  Four roads in total will be affected by the closures, with restrictions in place between 3pm and 1am.  These are the roads which will be closed  Oak Leaze at Hayes Way Charlton Boulevard at Hayed Way Cleve Road at A38 College Way at Filton Avenue Organisers DHP Family have stated traffic stewards will be on hand at all times to help direct traffic, and provide access for residents. People living in the area have been told to keep a copy of a letter sent to them in their cars, so they can gain speedy access to their homes.  The company behind the event also took the opportunity to apologise for the imminent disruption. The letter reads: "We’d like to finish by saying that we do fully appreciate that this event will cause some disruption for local residents around Filton Airfield, please be assured that DHP Family are fully committed to keeping the disruption of the event to a minimum."  A spokesperson for South Gloucestershire Council confirmed last week tat the road closures would be managed by experienced marshals, who would be able to help residents or those with a need to access the affected areas with any queries.  The letter also details noise control procedures, warning residents of sound checks taking place on February 28 and on the day of the events themselves.  The giant steel structure is expected to have been dismantled by March 11, at which point all trace of the huge shows will have disappeared from the airfield.<|im_end|>

# Nepal's tourism minister among 7 dead in chopper crash

KATHMANDU: Nepal's tourism minister Rabindra Adhikari was among seven people killed Wednesday (Feb 27) when a helicopter crashed in the country's hilly east, officials said. Rescue workers retrieved the bodies of Adhikari, 49, the pilot and five other passengers from a hillside in Taplejung district where the Air Dynasty chopper went down.  "The respected minister's body has been identified," Ram Krishna Subedi, the spokesman for the Ministry of Home Affairs, said in a press conference. Subedi said two army helicopters had been dispatched to bring the bodies back to the capital Kathmandu. It is unclear why the helicopter crashed. A search and rescue team was deployed to the area after locals alerted authorities to flames and smoke rising from a hillside.  "The helicopter is in pieces, and scattered all over," said Suraj Bhattarai, a witness who saw the debris. The bodies of the others killed in the crash have not yet been identified. The minister was on a trip to scope out a possible location for a new airport in the region. It is just the latest aviation accident to plague Nepal, an impoverished Himalayan nation with a poor air safety record. Nepal has some of the world's most remote and tricky runways, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge for even accomplished pilots. The country has a booming private helicopter industry, flying tourists and goods to remote corners of the Himalayan nation where road access is limited or non-existent. In September last year, six people including a Japanese tourist was killed when a helicopter crashed. A US-Bangla Airways plane crashed near the capital's airport in March, killing 51 people. Nepal-based airlines are banned from flying in European Union airspace. Its poor air safety record is largely blamed on inadequate maintenance and sub-standard management.<|im_end|>

# Ben Affleck & Lindsay Shookus Rekindle Their Romance

After splitting back in August, Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus have rekindled their romance and have been spending time together once again. As Us Weekly shared, though sources close to the duo won’t say if they are officially back together, Shookus reached out to the Good Will Hunting actor earlier this month, and “they’ve picked up right where they left off.”  Affleck and Shookus split up last summer when Affleck started a brief fling with model Shauna Sexton. Shortly after the tryst, Affleck’s ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, staged an intervention for the actor which lead to a 40-day stint in a rehabilitation facility to help get his alcohol abuse under control.  Following his third time in an addiction specialist facility, Affleck reached out to his fans on social media to thank them for their support. He encouraged his followers to seek help should they need it and said that he hopes that his struggle with addiction will inspire those who are walking down a similar path to reach out to him should they need advice on how to get, and stay, sober.  “Battling any addiction is a lifelong and difficult struggle. Because of that, one is never really in or out of treatment. It is a full-time commitment. I am fighting for myself and my family,” Affleck shared.  Earlier this month, a source told Us that following Affleck’s completion of treatment and his continued outpatient care, Shookus, 38, reached out to her former beau and the on-again, off-again couple started seeing each other again, quite casually.  “They’ve been talking and have seen each other again. Ben is in a much better place health-wise and is a lot happier,” the insider revealed.  Following that reconnection, the duo was spotted out together grabbing a bite to eat and some coffee in Brentwood, California. An eagle-eyed fan spotted the former couple while they were out and about and said that Shookus looked very happy having reconnected with Affleck.  Another insider said that Affleck and Shookus will likely take it slow this time around. They’ve always enjoyed each other’s company — and the split hasn’t changed that — but living on different coasts was once a hurdle for the couple, which could be again. Affleck is in California for work and to see the children he shares with Jennifer Garner. And Shookus, a producer for Saturday Night Live based in New York City, likely does not have plans to relocate to the west coast.  “They will keep talking and see what happens. It wouldn’t be surprising if they got back together, but with the distance and living on different coasts it’s difficult,” the source shared.<|im_end|>

# A Wyoming county will open a school to serve a single student

The nearest school to one Wyoming kindergartner is more than an hour drive's away. In harsh winter months in the rural area north of Laramie, that trek can be too difficult to cross and infeasible to pass.  So, a Wyoming school district will open a school just for that one student in the fall.  The isolated school isn't new.  Cozy Hollow Elementary School was active more than a decade ago when it hosted at most five students, Albany County School District No. 1 official Ed Goetz told CNN.  But it closed due to a lack of students in the area. Now it's needed again.  The district will submit an application to the Wyoming Department of Education School Facilities Division to get state funding to re-open the school, Goetz said.  It estimates it will need $100,000 a year for the cost of one teacher, supplies, utilities and site repairs. Ultimately, there will be two students when a sibling of the current child starts kindergarten.  Wyoming state law requires an on-site school for isolated students who can't travel in certain road conditions to another nearby school. It's the second one-student school in Albany County.  Wyoming isn't the only state that has to resort to isolated schools. Minnesota, for example, has a one-room public school in Angle Inlet.

# Man finds upwards of 50 dead ducks in southeast Calgary park

The province is investigating after a Calgary man says he came across upwards of 50 dead ducks scattered in Elliston Park while walking his dog in the area. Wayne Clarke, who visits on the park almost daily with his wife to walk their dog, said he began to notice the problem about 10 days ago, when he found one dead duck. “I figured, ‘OK, it must have just froze,’” Clarke said. “The next day, we go for another walk around the lake and there’s like three dead birds.” He said they stayed home for the next few days due to extreme cold temperatures, but when they returned, the problem had multiplied. By then, there were easily around a dozen dead birds on the southeast park’s frozen storm water retention pond, which is located near the intersection of 68 Street and 17 Avenue S.E. “We couldn’t believe this,” said Clarke, who has frequented the park for years. “I’ve never seen this many birds killed, only one or two.” On his most recent visit, he estimated there were around 50 dead ducks, many of which had been scavenged. “I kind of got perturbed about it at that point. Why isn’t the city cleaning this up?,” he said. “It’s a bloody mess. Scavengers have been there. We’ve seen magpies, crows, ravens, even seen a bald eagle, and the footprints are there for coyotes”. “There’s blood everywhere. What used to be carcasses or full birds are now just bones and feathers. It’s really messy. It looks terrible.” It’s unclear what caused that many ducks to die in that spot. A spokesperson for the City of Calgary said the city was “working on getting information” about what happened. “We are working with wildlife authorities to clear away the ducks that have been found, and will continue to assist in any way we can as they respond to this incident,” the city stated. Alberta Environment and Parks was also looking into the situation, a spokesperson confirmed, as provincial biologists and wildlife officers investigated the situation on Wednesday. “In late February, numerous waterfowl were observed dead in the proximity of a stormwater pond in Elliston Park in southeast Calgary. Based on the information that is currently available, it appears that this is a localized phenomenon. Natural factors such as weather, disease, and starvation are being evaluated,” the province said in a statement. “At present, Alberta Environment and Parks biologists are gathering additional information.”<|im_end|>

# Former SC prosecutor Johnson pleads guilty to scheme to steal thousands

Dan Johnson, once a rising S.C. political and law enforcement star, pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday to a count of wire fraud involving a long-running scheme to use taxpayer money for his personal expenses.  The 48-year-old Johnson will be sentenced June 4. Prosecutors plan to ask that Johnson, who they say stole more than $44,000, be sentenced to 1 1/2 years in prison.  Johnson appeared to blink back tears but had no comment as he exited a courtroom in Columbia’s federal courthouse after a 45-minute hearing. During the hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Cameron McGowan Currie took Johnson through a lengthy series of questions designed to ensure the former prosecutor knew the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty to a felony, including the right to own a gun, vote and hold elected office.  Sign Up and Save  Get six months of free digital access to The State  #ReadLocal  “Yes, your honor,” Johnson replied repeatedly to Currie’s questions.  “How do you wish you plead?” Currie asked.  “Guilty, your honor,” said Johnson.  Johnson entered a guilty plea to only a single count in a 36-count federal indictment  However, Currie and Assistant U.S. Attorney Winston Holliday, who summarized the government’s case, made it clear that count involved a continuous scheme to steal money from the solicitor’s office by using its credit card to pay Johnson’s personal expenses.  Johnson used an office credit card to pay for “travel, vacations, romantic liaisons and double-reimbursements for military training,” Currie said. Standing outside the federal courthouse, U.S. Attorney Sherri Lydon said Johnson’s guilty plea was a victory for equal justice under the law. “The message today is that the law comes in one size. One size fits all,” Lydon said. “It fits the citizen. It fits the elected official. It fits the prosecuted and the prosecutor. And it most definitely fits Dan Johnson.”  A year ago, Johnson was readying to run for a third four-year term as 5th Circuit solicitor, paid about $140,000 a year. As solicitor, Johnson had a staff of about 140, a $6 million-a-year budget, and supervised criminal prosecutions in Richland and Kershaw counties. Then, the Public Access to Public Records advocacy group obtained thousands of records about Johnson’s spending during his seven-plus years in office. Among the records were hundreds of expenses for hotels, air travel and hotel rooms, around the nation and world.  The FBI and the State Law Enforcement Division started an investigation, and Johnson lost June’s Democratic primary to Byron Gipson, a lawyer and political newcomer who promised to restore trust to the solicitor’s office.  “Today’s plea is an important step forward in restoring public confidence in our criminal justice system,” Lydon said, adding the solicitor’s office now can “come out from under the cloud of Dan Johnson.”  Holliday told Judge Currie that Johnson used his office credit card to pay $44,317 in personal expenses in 2016 and 2017. The government will be seek restitution.  The specific count to which Johnson pleaded guilty involved four expenses — a $280 motel room in Las Vegas, a $911 motel room in Chicago, a $685 flight on a Panamanian airline and a $135 motel room in Columbia.  Had Johnson gone to trial, prosecutors were prepared to prove the other 35 counts in the indictment, Holliday said afterward. Those counts included allegations that Johnson tried to obstruct the investigation by erasing data from his office iPhone and iPad, and he stole money from the S.C. Air National Guard by submitting expenses already paid by the solicitor’s office. Those counts will be dropped at Johnson’s sentencing hearing.  Johnson could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. However, as a first-time offender pleading guilty to a non-violent crime, he likely will not serve much time.  Prosecutors said they expect to ask that Johnson serve 1 1/2 years in prison. However, Judge Currie could sentence Johnson to probation.  State charges alleging embezzlement also are pending against Johnson. Those charges involve basically the same offenses to which Johnson pleaded guilty.

# Kane helps Blackhawks rally to 4-3 win over Ducks

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Patrick Kane scored with 16.1 seconds remaining on an odd-man rush and the Chicago Blackhawks rallied for a 4-3 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Wednesday night.  Alex DeBrincat scored two goals, Artem Anisimov had a short-handed goal and Corey Crawford made 29 saves as the Blackhawks snapped a two-game losing streak.  The Blackhawks trailed 3-2 midway through the third when DeBrincat tied it at 15:06 when Jonathan Toews made a cross-crease pass and DeBrincat beat Ryan Miller on his stick side.  The goal was DeBrincat 36th of the season and made him the fourth player in Blackhawks history to score 35 or more goals in a season at age 21 or younger. He joined Bobby Hull, Steve Larmer and Jeremy Roenick, who did it two straight seasons.  Kane then got the winner when Brandon Saad found him streaking up ice for his 40th of the season.  Devin Shore, Carter Rowney and Troy Terry scored for Anaheim, which has dropped its last four. Miller stopped 31 shots.  DeBrincat gave the Blackhawks an early lead 49 seconds into the second period on the power play when his shot from the left faceoff circle went off the post and past Miller. The goal came 13 seconds after Anaheim’s Rickard Rakell was ejected and given a five-minute major for hitting Drake Caggiula from behind and into the boards behind the Chicago net.  The Ducks evened it at 1 at 4:22 when Shore scored a short-handed goal on a 2-on-1 rush. It was the forward’s seventh of the season and just the third short-handed goal by Anaheim.  Both teams then traded goals less than two minutes apart late in the second. Anisimov put Chicago ahead at 16:42 on a short-handed rush up ice when he snapped one past Miller’s blocker. Rowney tied it at 18:37 when he redirected Ryan Kessler’s pass in front of the goal.  Terry scored his second goal of the season at 5:35 of the third when he took a pass from Derek Grant and put it past Chicago’s Corey Crawford, who was unable to clear the puck out of his zone. Crawford struggled to play the puck behind the net, which allowed Grant to skate in, grab possession and make a between his legs pass to Terry.  NOTES: According to SportRadar, this is the seventh game this season in which a short-handed goal has been scored by both teams. … Toews extended his points streak to seven with an assist on DeBrincat’s second goal. He has nine points (four goals, five assists) during the streak. … The Blackhawks have scored on the power play in 20 of their last 25 games.  UP NEXT  Blackhawks: Travel to the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday.  Ducks: Host the Vegas Golden Knights on Friday.  ___  Follow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy  ___  More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports<|im_end|>

# The impact religion has on child development

Do children raised by religious parents have better social and psychological development than those raised in non-religious homes?  In a new study, researchers found that religion can be a mixed blessing for children as they get older.  John Bartkowski, professor of sociology at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), Xiaohe Xu, professor of sociology at UTSA and chair of the Department of Sociology, and Stephen Bartkowski, from the Office of Institutional Research and Effectiveness Services at the Alamo Colleges District, recently published an article called, “Mixed Blessing: The Beneficial and Detrimental Effects of Religion on Child Development among Third-Graders” in the journal Religions.  The team analyzed data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS)-Kindergarten Cohort to complete the study.  They examined the effects of parents’ religious attendance and how the religious environment in the household (frequency of parent-child religious discussions and spousal conflicts over religion) influenced a nationally representative sample of third-graders.  They reviewed the children’s psychological adjustment, interpersonal skills, problem behaviors, and performance on standardized tests (reading, math, and science).  They found that third-graders’ psychological adjustment and social competence were positively correlated with various religious factors.  However, students’ performance on reading, math, and science tests were negatively associated with several forms of parental religiosity.  The findings suggest that parental religiosity is a mixed blessing that produces significant gains in social psychological development among third-graders while potentially undermining academic performance, particularly in math and science.  “Religion emphasizes moral codes designed to instill values such as self-control and social competence,” said Bartkowski.  “Religious groups’ prioritization of these soft skills may come at the expense of academic performance, which is generally diminished for youngsters raised in religious homes when compared with their non-religious peers.”  This research builds upon a previous study conducted by Bartkowski and colleagues.  Published in 2008, that study was the earliest to use national data to analyze the impact religion has on child development.  That study found that religion was associated with enhanced psychological adjustment and social competence among primary school-age children (kindergartners).  Bartkowski also discovered that religious solidarity among couples and communication between parent and child were linked to positive development characteristics while religious conflict among spouses was connected to negative outcomes.  Bartkowski said there are many ways to pursue well-rounded development, and religion is only one avenue.  “If it takes a village to raise a child, religion occupies an important place in that village. But it certainly doesn’t have a corner on fostering positive developmental trajectories for children.  “In fact, religion may be best paired with other community resources such as academically oriented school clubs and activities,” he concluded.

# Salem Red Sox have baseball’s first all-female broadcast booth

Last April, Jenny Cavnar called play-by-play for the Rockies, becoming at least the third woman to call televised play-by-play for a major league team. The others are Gayle Gardner (Rockies, 1993) and Suzyn Waldman (Yankees, mid-1990’s). Jessica Mendoza is part of ESPN’s broadcast booth for Sunday Night Baseball as well, though she obviously does not do play-by-play.  The Salem Red Sox, the organization’s High-A affiliate, announced on Wednesday that it will have baseball’s first all-female broadcast booth for the 2019 season. Suzie Cool and new hire Melanie Newman will share broadcasting duties. Their first night working together will be on April 23.  As Salem’s announcement points out, the only other women calling games in the minor leagues are Kirsten Karbach (Phillies; Double A Reading), Emma Tiedemann (Royals; Single-A Lexington), and Jill Gearin (Diamondbacks; High-A Visalia).  Kudos to the Salem Red Sox for helping put women in the broadcast booth. Baseball broadcasting still remains largely the domain of white men, so breaking up the monotony is a welcome change. Hopefully more teams, major league and minor league, make the same effort to diversify their broadcast booths.<|im_end|>

# Ask Jennifer Adams: Outdoor rugs add durable style and color inside

Q: My parents have carpeting in their bathroom and in the guest room/bathroom where I stay when I visit. I love how warm that feels, instead of cold floors that are usually in bathrooms. The bathroom in my condo is big, so I am thinking of using some kind of rug in there over the hard tiles. Is that OK? What should I look out for?  A: Area rugs in any room are a great way to help define a space, add color and express your personal style. Especially in a bathroom, a beautiful rug on the floor provides an unexpected luxurious touch, as well as warmth. As you know, stepping onto a cold floor with bare feet isn’t the most fun way to wake up!  A lot of people think area rugs and carpeting don’t belong in a bathroom at all because of all the moisture. If your bathroom is small, poorly ventilated or has a lot of water splashing around, the dampness and humidity can build up and cause mildew and mold. But if you have a large bathroom, or if it isn’t used often, such as in the case of a guest bath, placing a rug where it won’t get wet is perfectly fine.  Most area rugs can take a little splashing now and then, if allowed to dry. Shop with this in mind, and ask yourself a lot of questions. If you have a hardworking bathroom that does see a lot of action, avoid carpet and consider an area rug designed especially for the outdoors. These rugs are made to hold up to the elements, will be more durable than most other rugs, and may be less likely to grow mold and mildew. Some are even reversible. For all of these reasons, outdoor rugs could work just as well for kitchens, laundry rooms, entryways, or basements. An indoor/outdoor rug might not be quite as plush as a more traditional area rug, but it will still be softer and warmer than tile or wood flooring. And these days, there are so many designs available that you’re sure to find one you love.  Consider a size that will keep the rug away from water or toothpaste, or look for a design you could have trimmed. Make sure the rug won’t slip by using a moisture-resistant rug pad, carpet tape, or other method that will work with your rug and floor.<|im_end|>

# "Silver State Monsters" – A New Book Reviewed | Mysterious Universe

Silver State Monsters: Cryptids & Legends of Nevada is the new book from David Weatherly. You’ll know David from his previous books Black Eyed Children and Strange Intruders (among others). As you’ll guess from the title of David’s new book, this one is focused on the subject of Cryptozoology, or the study of unknown animals. And, as you’ll also see, it’s very much a regional study of strange creatures. I particularly like regional-based books on unknown animals, mainly because you’re far more likely to get highly detailed accounts, rather than brief entries in a book that might be focused on a nationwide or worldwide study. And, with that said, let’s take a look at the book. It’s good to see that the foreword comes from Lyle Blackburn, one of the leading figures in the field of Bigfoot-based research.  As Lyle notes of David: “He’s the type of researcher that puts his weathered boots on the ground in order to evaluate the latest in paranormal cases, as well as those which have become staples in our modern culture. And now with Silver State Monsters, David hits the road again, this time to explore a land that’s literally steeped in mystery.” Lyle’s words are important, as they accurately show that David is one of those who regularly hits the road and goes on expeditions in search of the creatures he’s writing about. In other words, David is not an armchair researcher. In fact, an armchair researcher is the very last thing that Cryptozoology needs. There’s no real alternative to getting out into the field, which is exactly what David does. And that approach shines throughout the pages of Silver State Monsters.  I guess that many people view Nevada as a huge desert, known for being home to Las Vegas and Area 51. But, as this book shows, there’s way more going on, all of a beastly and monstrous nature. David begins with an excellent chapter titled “Water Creatures in the Desert.” We’re talking about Nevada’s equivalents of Nessie, Champ and Ogopogo. We learn of an 1868 case from the Aurora, Nevada newspaper, the Esmeralda Union, which describes the sighting, by one Reuben Strathers, of a beast with “a head in shape not unlike that of the crocodile, with forefeet near the neck, with with tail of enormous length, which lay perfectly quiet, and only the body part moving, which apparently was covered with scales, glistening in the morning sun.”  Then, there’s the story of a bizarre monster seen in Lake Tahoe. It tells of something that sounds like it came straight out of the pages of an H.P. Lovecraft novel. The description of the animal was of “an upside-down pink bowl with legs – or tentacles I suppose – coming out of it; too many to count…it made a noise, like it was struggling to breathe, loud wheezing.” Bizarre? Yep! But, as David shows Lake Tahoe has a long history of mysterious beasts in its depths. In fact, David devotes no less than thirteen pages to what has become known as “Tahoe Tessie.” Similarly, we get nine pages on the “Walker Lake Serpent,” which is described as an immense snake-like animal, and known to the local Native Americans. Add to that the mysterious, ominous, crying “Water Babies” of Pyramid Lake and what you have is an excellent section on Nevada’s water-based “things” of the very weird type.  When you think of Nevada, you probably don’t think of Bigfoot. But, you should. Although I was aware of a number of Bigfoot reports from Nevada, I wasn’t aware of the sheer level of such reports of what David refers to as “Sasquatch, Giants & Wildmen.” One such report, from 1973, describes an encounter reported by two couples out at Lake Tahoe – a place we have already addressed in relation to lake-monsters. In this case, the creature was described as “shiny,” “about seven feet tall,” and with a face “like a gorilla’s.” It’s interesting to note that now and again reports surface of more than one type of cryptid seen in the same area, and that one is a perfect example. Then, there’s the very weird matter of the Bigfoot seen on the highly sensitive Nevada Test Site in 1980. It’s a strange tale that blends cryptozoology and conspiracy into one heady mix. As does the saga of “Battle Mountain Bigfoot,” which focuses on what the U.S. Government may know about Bigfoot in Nevada.  Check out the chapter “Giants in the Deserts,” too. This is an excellent section of the book, which details David’s very own road-trip to Nevada’s Lovelock Cave, a place which has – for some researchers – become inextricably connected to Bigfoot lore. David tackles the matter of ancient legends of the Paiutes, and of giant and dangerous creatures said to roam the land centuries ago. And he does so in a very balanced fashion, scrutinizing the various theories that have been put forward to try and understand the truth behind the tales. David says: “While the legends are fascinating, the obvious question is how much truth is there to the whole story…? Were these creatures, these giant cannibals, just a part of the spiritual belief system of the tribe? Were they pure mythology?” A great deal of sensationalized material has been written about this particular saga and it’s to David’s credit that he handles it all in a responsible fashion.  In the final sections of the book we are treated to accounts of what are referred to as “flying anomalies.” Not quite something along the lines of Mothman, but things akin to Native American Thunderbirds. A UFO connection to unknown animals is studied in a genuinely weird case from 1925. Giant snakes are profiled, as is a spiky cat known as the “Cactus Cat.” And everything rounds off with the matter of Nevada’s “Hell Dogs,” which are not unlike the “Phantom Black Dogs” of the U.K. For fans of Cryptozoology, this is a book not to be missed.<|im_end|>

# 7 Shocking Facts About Drinking Water Cold Vs. Room Temperature

7 Shocking Facts About Drinking Water Cold Vs. Room Temperature Have you ever noticed a difference in how you feel when drinking cold versus room temperature water? If not, there's a good chance you at least have a preference for one or the other, when it comes to what you reach for when you're thirsty. And there are several possible reasons for that. The stomach reacts differently to cold water, than it does to warm, which can in turn affect digestion. The temperature of water can also impact your circulation, according to experts, and can even contribute to things like headaches. When it comes to hydration, though, it's important to keep in mind that water is water, no matter the temp. "All water is good," Dr. Jill Blakeway, a licensed and board-certified doctor of acupuncture and Chinese medicine, and founder and clinical herbalist at Yinova, tells Bustle. "Cold water is refreshing and cooling. It’s great on a hot day and a good choice after exercise." But you can feel free to choose whichever temperature you like best. "Drinking warm water may be better in some instances where as drinking cold water might also be more beneficial," registered dietician Vanessa Rissetto, tells Bustle. "It really boils down to preference and what you feel might be right for you." Read on for more facts about cold versus room temperature water, according to experts. 1Room Temperature Water Can Make You Less Thirsty Drinking warmer water can actually make you less thirsty, which is something to keep in mind if you're trying to stay hydrated. "This can be dangerous on days when your body is losing water through sweating to try to keep cool," Rissetto says. "If you do opt to drink warm water, be aware that you may not feel thirsty as often as you should." 2Cold Water Is Beneficial After A Workout While water of any temperature will help rehydrate you after a workout, going for cold water may be a good idea if you're feeling hot and sweaty. "Cold water is cooling so it can be helpful during exercise or when you are overheated," Dr. Blakeway says. That's why you may want to keep an icy water bottle with you, to sip on post-run. 3Room Temperature Water Aids In Digestion For the most efficient digestion, drinking room temperature — or even warm water — is where it's at. "In Chinese medicine we advocate drinking warm water because of its effect on the digestive system," Dr. Blakeway says. "Drinking cold water can congeal the fats in food and because of that can make the digestive system sluggish." 4Cold Water Can Give You A Headache 5Room Temperature Water Combats Constipation "Unlike cold water, warm water improves circulation and can relax muscles, [which can help] combat constipation and abdominal cramping," Dr. Blakeway says. If you're feeling a little uncomfortable, a room temperature glass of water, or even a warm cup of tea, can help relax the stomach muscles and get things moving. 6Cold Water Can Stuff Up Your Sinuses 7Room Temperature Water Boosts Metabolism Drinking warmer water can increase your overall body temperature. And that can be beneficial for your metabolism, Dr. Blakeway says. And yet, when it comes time to grab a glass of water, it's really up to you whether you pour it straight out of the fridge, or go for water that's room temperature. There are benefits and downsides to both, so it should be all about your personal preference.<|im_end|>

# Sun Yang records personal fastest 1,500m freestyle in four years

Sun Yang celebrates after winning the 1,500m freestyle of the Chinese Swimming National Championships held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, on Sunday, March 31, 2019. [Photo/Xinhua)  Olympic champion Sun Yang fired off his personal-best 1,500m freestyle in four years and collected his fourth title on the last day of the Chinese Swimming National Championships on Sunday.  Sun, who stormed three world-best time this season in 200m, 400m and 800m, led the field to win the 1,500m freestyle in 14 minutes 55.00 seconds, his personal-best since 2015.  Ji Xinjie came to second in 15:03.38 and Cheng Long third in 15:10.80.  "It was the event I felt the most satisfied among all the four events I have competed. I beat the barrier of 15-minute and clocked my best time in four years since I changed my focus to the middle distance after 2012 Olympic Games," said the 27-year-old, the eldest one at the meet.  "I was so excited and happy because I found back my endurance for this marathon event and felt more confident in the mid-long distance events," Sun said.  Olympic champion Ye Shiwen continued her winning comeback in the 400m individual medley by claiming gold in 4:37.57. "Compared with 200m IM and 200m breaststroke, 400 IM was the weakest part of my events. But it was a good sign that I am a reborn swimmer," said the 23-year-old.  Asian record holder Liu Xiang crowned in her favorite 50m freestyle in 24.70, beating Wu Qingfeng's 24.77 and Zhu Menghui's 24.92.  "I did not feel good since this was the only event I competed in this meet. I expected a better time," said the 50m backstroke world record holder.  Xu Jiayu completed a golden-triple in the men's 50m backstroke with a time of 24.47 after he swept victories in 100m and 200m backstroke. Wang Peng took a silver in 25.17 and Li Guangyuan finished third in 25.28.  Team Zhejiang wrapped the men's and women's 4X100m medley relays in 4:02.50 and 3:37.51, respectively.  The eight-day competition, which attracted about 900 swimmers from 25 teams from March 24 to 31, serves as the qualifying tournament for the 2019 FINA Swimming World Championships in Gwangju, South Korea in July.<|im_end|>

# A Stealthy F-15X: A Good Idea or a Waste of Time for the Air Force?

Sebastien Roblin Security, We have a look. A Stealthy F-15X: A Good Idea or a Waste of Time for the Air Force? Designers of clean sheet 4.5-generation fighters certainly should aim for lower RCS. However, Boeing is seeking to sell the F-15X on the premise of its affordability and low operating costs. However, a Silent Eagle-style F-15 would entail a modified airframe and require expensive Radar Absorbent Materials, diminishing the cost savings. A recent article concerning Boeing’s pitch to the U.S. Air Force of a cheap, modestly upgraded F-15X fighter elicited lamentations from some commenters that the Air Force was not enticed by a more ambitious proposal for the F-15SE Silent Eagle—an F-15 with a reduced radar cross-section. (This first appeared late last year.) Reduced radar cross-sections (RCS) are a common feature in the cutting-edge o 4.5 generation fighters. Before reduced-RCS engineering was widely understood, manufacturers designed fighter like the F-15 or F-16 that had an RCS of around 3 to 5 m2 or greater. By comparison, the U.S. military’s newest fourth-generation fighter, the FA-18E/F Super Hornet, might as well be called the Silent Hornet with an RCS ranging between .1 and 1 m2. The French Rafale has a 1m2 RCS, and the Swedish Gripen and Eurofighter Typhoon around half that at .5m2. Relatively small, RCS-optimized fighters also include the F-16C (1.2 m2) and Chinese J-10 (1.5 m2) Even Russia boasts that its longtime counterpart to the F-15, the Flanker, has been improved with an RCS between 1 to 3 m2 in the most advanced Su-35S model. However, RCS is not uniform across all aspects of a plane, so these designs are doubtlessly more visible from certain angles. Furthermore, RCS is often calculated from frontal radar visibility of a ‘clean’ airplane not carrying weapons. Of course, fighters will be carrying weapons, so the observability for fourth-generation fighters will usually be inferior in practice to these optimal figures. In 2009 Boeing unveiled a Silent Eagle demonstrator with stealth characteristics stemming from its use of a conformal weapons bay to store radar-conspicuous weapons internally, application of expensive Radar-Absorbent Materials (RAM), and limited airframe modifications including outwardly canted vertical stabilizers. (A conformal weapons bay has also been proposed for the Super Hornet, but the Navy has so far demurred.) There were also update that have since migrated to the proposed F-15X including an Infrared Search and Track system, an improved APG-82 radar, modernized fly-by-wire controls, and an upgraded defensive suite. In the early 2010s, Boeing marketed the Silent Eagle to F-15 operators including Israel, Japan, Saudi Arabia and South Korea—but none of them jumped at the opportunity. There’s a reason why air forces haven’t been too enticed by a quasi-stealth fighter, and that’s because there’s a steep difference in performance between quasi-stealthy and the real thing. This is because for every order of magnitude (factor of ten) RCS decreases by, detection range decreases only by 43.7 percent. Thus a 1 m2 RCS will not be detected at one-tenth the distance that a 10 m2 RCS will, but something more like three-fifths the distance. That’s why true stealth jets like the F-22 and F-35s have had their cross-sections reduced to around the size of a golf-ball and a marble: .001 to .0001 m2. An F-15SE is thought to have a cross-section comparable to the Super Hornet with possibly a .1 m2 cross-section from the front and 1 or higher from other angles. This is a useful edge—but not a decisive one. Recommended: Russia's Next Big Military Sale - To Mexico? Recommended: Would China Really Invade Taiwan? First, note manufacturer claimed detection ranges for average jet fighters for the following radars—then consider the benefit of reducing RCS by an order of magnitude or two. (Manufacturer claims are noted; the rest are derived from the above formula, and thus not authoritative but seem to conform with claims.) Irbis-E PESA radar on the Su-35S 3 m2 230 miles (Manufacturer) .3 m2 131 miles .03 m2 75 miles .01 m2: 56 miles (Manufacturer) 96L6E “Cheeseboard” Radar on S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile (Russia’s top SAM system) 4 m2 242 miles (Manufacturer) .4 m2 138 miles (Manufacturer claims 142) .04 m2 78 miles* * Manufacturer claims ‘anti-stealth’ range of 94 miles. KLJ-7A Radar on Chinese JF-17 fighter 5 m2 105 miles (Manufacturer) .5 m2 60 miles .05 m2 34 miles Keep in mind that the F-35 has an RCS another order of magnitude smaller at around .001 m2, reducing detection range to just a few dozen miles. To be clear, these are ballpark figures—in reality, radar detection is complicated by many additional variables such as background clutter, and an aircraft is rarely immediately detected at the maximum possible distance. Furthermore, range figures often use the radar’s narrowly focused tracking mode, rather than the broader ‘Volume’ area-search mode. Different bandwidth radars on other platforms may also prove more effective than the X-Band radars on a fighter. Now consider the effective range of notable Beyond Visual Range radar-guided anti-aircraft missiles, excluding very-long range types such as the 40N6 or R-37 that are not designed to hit a fighter-type target. 48N6E2/E3 (Mach 5.9 missile used in S-300 and S-400 SAM system) 120-160 mile R-77-1 (Standard Mach 4 BVR missile for Russian fighters) 68 miles K-77M (Next-gen BVR missile on Russian fighters)120 miles PL-12 (Standard Mach 4 BVR missile on Chinese fighters) 43-62 miles In effect, the reduced detection range is roughly around the maximum range of the deadlier missiles, and well above the range of less cutting-edge weapons like the PL-12 and R-77-1. Realistically, though, a fighter would be unlikely to launch at the farthest extent of its range envelope, as that would give an adversary a large window of opportunity to evade. Therefore, we can see that reduced RCS gives a fourth-generation fighter a situational awareness edge against another non-stealth opponent. However, that advantage would rarely limit the range at which the reduced-RCS fighter could be fired upon. That advantage could also be lessened if adversary fighters are directed by ground-based sites or AWACS aircraft with longer detection ranges. Designers of clean sheet 4.5-generation fighters certainly should aim for lower RCS. However, Boeing is seeking to sell the F-15X on the premise of its affordability and low operating costs. However, a Silent Eagle-style F-15 would entail a modified airframe and require expensive Radar Absorbent Materials, diminishing the cost savings. That Silent Eagle would have to remain substantially lower than the much stealthier F-35A’s projected $85 million cost, or there would little point to procuring them. The fact that a figure of $100 million per Silent Eagle was widely floated around in the past does not seem encouraging on that front. Of course, a Silent Eagle would still possess certain speed and range advantages relative to an F-35, but compared to the proposed F-15X it would actually sacrifice range (the conformal weapons bays being in the place of fuel tanks) and payload (up to 22 externally mounted missiles on the F-15X, versus four to six internal missiles on the F-15SE.) And for routine air defense and ground support, low-observable characteristics would be of little value. Low-observable fourth-generation jets do have a tangible advantage—but far from a decisive one when compared to stealth jets. Spending extra on stealthier F-15s would likely come at too high a cost for too little benefit when it comes to replacing the F-15C.

# Game Of Thrones star breaks silence on enrolling at Birmingham Uni

A Game of Thrones star who swapped the smash-hit Sky Atlantic series for the University of Birmingham has revealed all about his student life in the city.  Isaac Hempstead-Wright broke his silence on heading to the University of Birmingham in a brand-new interview with Esquire Online .  Isaac, 19, plays Bran Stark in the hit show and his enrollment in Brum was revealed by BirminghamLive back in September 2017.  The actor studied maths at the city educational institution after achieving three A-grades in his A-levels.  It didn't take long for the students to release they were working alongside a star and he has told Esquire Magazine all about his first year and the carnage that came with it.  Isaac, who plays Bran Stark in the show, said: "I had the nicest flatmates.  "But it made it quite difficult to make friends.  "I don't think I'll ever be able to have a normal university experience, which is kind of sad.  Follow James Rodger on social media  "I couldn't relax and go out and have a drink or get drunk or whatever, because if I did someone would be like: "I saw Bran and he was all f***** up".  "I was a bit of a hermit.  "My ex-girlfriend came up to visit and we just sat in my room for a week."  An employee of student favourite Joe’s Bar claimed Hempstead-Wright was at the drinking spot during lunchtime on Wednesday, September 20, 2017.  “I saw him walk past a couple of times and I served two customers that sat near him. It was a society and they were sat with him,” said Harry Mackenzie.  Hasan Ayub, an Economics second year, told the site that Hempstead-Wright was “getting swarmed” at a sports fair later in the afternoon.  "Never thought I would run into Bran Stark in Bham," one Twitter user wrote.  "My sister goes to uni with bran stark, went on a night out with him yesterday!" another added.  Another wrote: "Just found out Bran Stark is at my uni on my flat mates course...fangirling just a tad..."  He added: "I went out to some awful club night, and it was just... a massacre.  "There were so many tweets.  "And because your email is public domain, I got like, billions of emails from people going: "Hi Three-Eyed Raven!"  "I was just trying to find out where my next lecture was."<|im_end|>

# Land Reform to install 16 boreholes in Oshikoto

TSUMEB -The Ministry of Land Reform will install 16 boreholes during the current financial year on nine resettlement farms in Oshikoto for the benefit of the resettled farmers.  This comes in handy for farmers as the country experience sporadic rainfall, most of the farmers in the region are faced with water shortage especially those without boreholes. 
Resettled farmers will however be responsible for the maintenance and rehabilitation of the infrastructure, as part of the resettlement conditions. “Due to prevailing economic conditions, the ministry budget has been reduced and as a result the ministry had to re-align its 2018/19 financial year planned activities with the financial resources available. Among the affected activities includes acquisition and infrastructure development,” stressed the Minister of Land Reform Uutoni Nujoma in a speech read by the Governor Henock Kankoshi during a farmers’ Day meeting held in Tsumeb yesterday.  Nujoma thus implored farmers to upgrade from semi to fully-fledged commercial farmers in order increase productivity and enhance the agricultural economy.  “In order for this to happen, resettled farmers are required to go through various stages of agricultural transformations such as from subsistence to commercial, although there are challenges experienced during transition. The situation is further worsened by the persistent drought countrywide, hence we are pleading with our farmers to take resettlement farming seriously by upgrading from current level of semi-commercial to fully commercial farming,” emphasised Nujoma. 
The minister is however concerned about persistent cases of illegal occupation and subleasing of resettlement farms leading to overstocking, which results in degradation of farmland. In addition, he said the monitoring exercise report conducted yearly established that there is low productivity at some resettlement farms.  “Resettled farmers are expected to practice good agricultural farming methods and confine their numbers of animals to prescribed carrying capacity as provided by the land use plan of each farming unit. Non adherence to this is regarded as a violation of resettlement conditions,” warned Nujoma.  On his part, Kankoshi encouraged resettled farmers to be resilient and forge ahead despite all the challenges, which comes with farming. “My advice is to reduce your herds of animal by selling and invest the money for other developments and restocking when the situation improves,” said the governor, adding that agricultural sector presents a lot of opportunities hence can be a way to solve some of the social issue affecting our country, such as reducing high unemployment and hunger.  “The sector can also be a major contributor to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However this can only be achieved when resettlement farmers starts to adopt sustainable farming methods and invest sufficient resources on the farm,” noted Kankoshi. .  The event sought to educating farmers in areas of post-resettlement support services which include mentorship and access to finance, lease agreement which addresses issues of subleasing, drugs, alcohol and permanent improvement as well as inheritance of resettlement farms.

# HKIFF: ‘First Farewell’ and ‘You Have The Night’ Win Firebird Prizes

Xinjiang-set “A First Farewell” was named the best film in the Chinese section of the Hong Kong International Film Festival’s Firebird awards competition for young film makers. Montenegro-based Ivan Salatic’s “You Have The Night’ won the equivalent award in the rest of the world section.  Prizes were awarded at a ceremony on Sunday evening. The festival, which gou underway on March 18, draws to a close on Monday night.  A Chinese jury headed by Jiang Wen said that “Farewell” represents “near perfection” for a debut feature. Directed by Wang Lina, it “offers a lucid exposition of the characters’ heart and mind, and the actions driven by their inner selves. A debut feature that achieves high congruity between form and contents.”  The world cinema jury headed by veteran French critic, Michel Ciment rewarded “”YouHave Te Night” for “its depiction of a city by the sea and the closure of a shipyard (which) is also a portrayal of several generations, and the political evolution of a country.”   Acting prizes in the Chinese section went to Dang Yu as best actor in Xu Zhenhao’s “give Me A Ride” and to Huang Yao as best actress in “The Crossing.” Xu was also named best director.   In the world section the best director award went to Bas Devos for “Hellhole.” Gustav Lindh of “Queen of Hearts” and Martina Apostolova of “Irina” were named the best actor and best actress respectively.  For the Documentary Competition, the jury unanimously gave the Firebird Award to “Midnight Family” directed by Luke Lorentzen for “its non-judgmental approach to a story of interlocked poverty and tragedy is deeply moving.” The Jury Prize was awarded to Advocate directed by Rachel Leah Jones and Philippe Bellaiche.  “All These Creatures,” directed by Charles Williams was selected as the Firebird Award winner in the Short Film Competition. The Jury Prize was awarded to “The Call,” directed by Anca Damian.  This year’s FIPRESCI Prize went to “The Golden-Laden Sheep and the Sacred Mountain” directed by Ridham Janve, who “assembled a narrative that blends nature and spirituality into an irresistible and immersive flow.”<|im_end|>

# High School Baseball: Late run lifts Lewistown past Farmington

Ethan Mikulich’s sacrifice fly in the bottom of the sixth inning proved to be the game-winning at-bat as the Lewistown Indians edged the Farmington Farmers 3-2 on Friday.  Ethan Mikulich’s sacrifice fly in the bottom of the sixth inning proved to be the game-winning at-bat as the Lewistown Indians edged the Farmington Farmers 3-2 on Friday.  The winners improve to 5-2 while coach Justin Begner’s club falls to 2-5. Hits were at a premium in this game as Mikulich and Logan Owens kept the Farmington batters at bay, allowing a combined two hits. Meanwhile, Farmington sophomore hurler Cam Oldfield allowed the same two hits, both of them coming in the go-ahead inning. The game was scoreless until the Farmers scored their two runs in the top of the third. With one out, Riley Embry singled to left and went all the way to third when the throw back to the infield sailed wide of second. Then with Alex Romero at bat, an attempted pickoff throw to third went into the outfield, allowing the run to score. Romero ended up walking, stole second, went to third on a wild pitch and scored on a two-out triple off the bat of Steven DeVries. Meanwhile, Oldfield had allowed just one walk in the first three innings before he gave up two unearned runs in the fourth without the benefit of a hit. Owens began the rally, reaching on a two-base error. Kennedy Cleer then was hit by a pitch. After an out, Owens and Cleer pulled off a double steal with JT Kerr at bat. Kerr’s fly ball to left was dropped allowing Owens to score while Cleer advanced to third. Cleer plated the tying run, scoring on a passed ball. Mikulich finished his day on the mound after retiring the side in order in the fifth inning. The senior lefty allowed the two runs on two hits while striking out eight and walking two. “I think this was the most efficient that Ethan has pitched,” said Lewistown coach Scott Hammond. “I was glad to get him out after only 85 pitches.” As previously mentioned, it was in the sixth inning that the Indians scored what proved to be the winning run. Owens led off with a double and moved to third on a infield hit from Cleer, who advanced to third on a throwing error. Mikulich followed with a sacrifice fly to center to drive in the go-ahead run. Owens, who got the win to improve to 2-0, retired all six batters he faced, fanning three of them. “I thought Cam did an excellent job,” said Begner. “We just didn’t have enough bat support.” Mikulich and Cleer had Lewistown’s hits. Kerr and Mikulich drove in one run apiece. Embry and DeVries collected one hit apiece for the Farmers while DeVries had his team’s only RBI.<|im_end|>

# ID Released For Tractor-Trailer Driver Killed After Rear-Ending Another Truck On I-87

A tractor-trailer driver was killed over the weekend when his truck crashed into another tractor-trailer on the New York State Thruway, state police announced.  New York State Police troopers were dispatched to a stretch of the Thruway in Catskill at approximately 5:38 a.m. on Sunday, March 31, where there were multiple reports of a “serious” crash that left Schenectady resident Irinel Mladin-Kennedy dead.  According to police, two tractor-trailers were involved in the crash, with both catching on fire, forcing all northbound lanes to temporarily be closed for several hours after Mladin-Kennedy's truck veered off into the right shoulder, striking a second tractor-trailer being driven by Michael Wolf, of Red Lion, Pennsylvania.  One of the trucks was reportedly carrying coffee beans, while the second was a box trailer carrying mail, which was ignited in the crash.  Wolf, 63, was transported to a nearby hospital for treatment on what are believed to be non-life-threatening injuries, while Mladin-Kennedy, 51, was pronounced dead at the scene by the Greene County Coroner.  Police said that an autopsy on Mladin-Kennedy was conducted on Monday morning, and the cause of death was determined to be injuries related from the crash. A toxicology report is pending. Investigators noted that the Postal Inspector has been notified of the crash and the status of the load.  More information is expected to be released at a later time, police noted.

# Court dismisses AAC's suit against Rivers elections | TODAY.NG

A Federal High Court in Abuja has dismissed a suit by the African Action Congress (AAC) and one other, querying the propriety of handling of the last governorship and State Assembly elections in Rivers State, particularly as it relates to its announcement of the results, by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Justice Inyang Ekwo, in a judgment on Tuesday said the since the case was election-related, it was appropriate for the plaintiffs to take their case before an election tribunal. The Justice Ekwo declined jurisdiction and dismissed the case. The suit, marked FHC/ ABJ/CS/303/2019, has AAC, Engr Biokpomabo Festus Awara and Pastor (Dr.) Ben-Gurion John Peter as plaintiffs, with INEC and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The plaintiffs noted INEC had earlier admitted that the election in Rivers State was marred with substantial violence that compromised the credibility of the entire process, and thereby suspended the election. They added that without calling for a fresh election, INEC announced, via a press release, that it was now set to continue with the election from Wednesday, 20th March 20 19.<|im_end|>

# Jamal Khashoggi's children get huge "blood money" payouts from Saudi Arabia, Washington Post reports

The four children of slain Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi have been given million-dollar homes in the Kingdom and will get monthly payments of at least $10,000 as part of what the Post says is a "blood money" arrangement aimed at buying their silence. Khashoggi was brutally murdered in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul six months ago.  The U.S. substantiating an assessment that the crown prince ordered the killing of the columnist, who regularly criticized the royal family and the future king in particular. According to the Post's Greg Miller, Khashoggi's two sons and two daughters may also get "much larger payouts — possibly tens of millions of dollars apiece" once the conservative Islamic kingdom's courts wrap up the trials of the 11 people accused in the murder. Miller's report cited current and former officials from Saudi Arabia, all speaking anonymously. The kingdom maintains tight control on the flow of information; there is no domestic freedom of press and it does not allow foreign media entities to operate freely on its soil. Saudi prosecutors have , a Saudi national, which the kingdom's rulers initially denied any role in. Among those on trial are members of the crown prince's entourage. Five of the suspects are facing the death penalty. Turkey and the United Nations have accused Saudi Arabia of holding the trial in complete secrecy, and both are pushing for a full, impartial international investigation. The Trump administration, which has fostered close ties with Crown Prince Salman, has the U.S. intelligence community's assessment and refused to implicate Salman directly in the murder, drawing . Unconfirmed reports suggest the international scandal has prompted the king of Saudi Arabia to curtail his son Crown Prince Salman's power within the ruling family, but he has not been officially reprimanded and he is still in line to inherit the throne. The Post quoted a former Saudi official as saying the monthly payments and homes given to Khashoggi's children were personally approved by King Salman in an acknowledgement that "a big injustice has been done." The official said it was an effort by the royal family "to make a wrong right." Khashoggi's children, all adults, have remained virtually silent in the wake of their father's murder. One of them, Salah Khashoggi, met the king and the crown price, along with his own uncle, in a formal greeting orchestrated by the royal family just weeks after the murder. The Saudi government said the royals had delivered their personal condolences to Khashoggi's grieving son and brother.<|im_end|>

# Man dies after struggle with Mississippi police officers

A man died Saturday after a struggled with police officers, according to a Southaven Police Department news release. Around 2:19 a.m., officers observed a vehicle on Interstate 55 South about one mile south of Church Road. The vehicle was parked near the center median and was partially blocking the road, Captain Mark E. Little said in a statement. While officers were checking to see if the driver needed assistance, they determined that the man may have been under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. Officers asked the driver to step out of the vehicle, but the man refused. The driver became combative, according to Little, and a struggle ensued with the officers. During the struggle, the driver suffered a "medical emergency" and became unresponsive. An ambulance was called and officers began to first aid. The driver was transported to Baptist Memorial Hospital-DeSoto while resuscitation efforts continued. The driver was pronounced dead by the emergency room doctor. The incident is under investigation and no more information will be released at this time, Little said.<|im_end|>

# Despite penalties, Hamlin wins at Texas

FORT WORTH, Texas — Denny Hamlin had such a fast car at Texas that he was able to win even after two penalties on pit road and some other issues during green flag conditions. While Hamlin was reviewing all that happened, crew chief Chris Gabehart interrupted — "I think you passed 327 cars by my count, but maybe not," he said.  Hamlin, who once missed the entry to pit road and also ran out fuel during the race, did do a lot of passing to get to Victory Lane on Sunday. He led the final 12 laps and 45 overall to overcome those miscues and the penalties — one when he exited pit road too fast early in the day and another for a debatable tire violation against his team during a stop just past the halfway point. "I was just beating my head against the steering wheel thinking, 'Man, we're going to finish bad with a really fast race car,'" Hamlin said. "We just kept digging and Chris kept doing a good job encouraging us we had a long way to go. We kept passing cars and passing cars." Hamlin's No. 11 Toyota finished more than 2.7 seconds ahead of Clint Bowyer. The 334-lap race at the 1 1/2-mile track, with only three cautions outside the two stage stoppages, featured 27 lead changes among 13 drivers. It was the 33rd career victory for Hamlin. He won the season-opening Daytona 500 after he went winless last year to end a streak of 12 consecutive seasons getting into Victory Lane. His third win at Texas was his first since sweeping both races at the track in 2010. Gibbs drivers have won four of the seven races this season, and Team Penske won the other three. All four Stewart-Haas Racing finished in the top eight, led by Bower and Daniel Saurez finishing third. Aric Almirola and Kevin Harvick were seventh and eighth. Erik Jones, another Gibbs driver, finished fourth and polesitter Jimmie Johnson was fifth, just ahead of his Hendrick Motorsports teammate William Byron. Kurt Busch was ninth and JGR driver Kyle Busch finished 10th despite leading a race-high 66 laps in his attempt for a tripleheader weekend sweep.  Kyle Busch led six times, and was still in front with 59 laps to go when his No. 18 Toyota drifted high going into Turn 2. "It just busted loose on me, and I had to catch it and make sure we didn't crash," he said. While he avoided contact then, he slipped back to fourth. When trying to get back in front a few laps later, he brushed the outside wall and fell a lap behind after having to go to pit road. For the second time in a month, he missed out on a tripleheader sweep following Xfinity and Truck Series races in the same weekend. He completed such sweeps twice at Bristol, in 2010 and 2017. It was the third time at Texas that Kyle Busch won the Xfinity and Trucks races before coming up short in the weekend-ending Cup race. That also happened to him at his home track in Las Vegas four weeks earlier.<|im_end|>

# Daytona Lagoon Water Park Opening 2 New Slides in April

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — Later this month, Daytona Lagoon will cut the ribbon on two new water slides, with one replacing an attraction damaged by Hurricane Irma.  Daytona Lagoon opening 2 slides April 26 1 slide replaces a slide damaged during Irma in 2017 The park announced Tuesday that its Shaka Halfpipe and Kraken's Revenge slides will be open in a symbolic "ribbon cutting" celebration on Friday, April 26 at 10 a.m.  Kraken's Revenge replaces Kraken's Quest, which was damaged when the hurricane hit Florida in 2017. The new ride is a four-lane racing slide that rises over 50 feet tall and includes a high-speed "time warp" tunnel.  The Shaka Halfpipe is a pendulum-style ride with a single or two-person inner tube, which slides up one end and down the other of a 50-foot half pipe.  The two new slides were part of a nearly $1.5 million renovation, most of which was completed in the off-season.  Daytona Lagoon's water park is already open most days 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Daytona Lagoon is located off A1A, near the Ocean Center.

# USU football player charged with rape

USU football player charged with rape  LOGAN, Utah — A football player who signed with Utah State University last year has been charged with rape.  Lamar Anthony Dawson, 23, is accused of having nonconsensual sex with a woman he knew was intoxicated.  A document filed in 1st District Court Thursday indicates Dawson had been asked to bring a speaker back to the woman’s home, and he continued to exchange text messages with the woman after dropping off the speaker. Several text messages between Dawson and the alleged victim are documented in the court filing, and they indicate Dawson was aware the woman was intoxicated.  In one message, Dawson asked the woman if she wanted him to come over. The woman later agreed, but told Dawson not to expect sex “because I’m not in the right mindset to make that decision,” according to the document.  Police learned the woman had been taking a new medication which, when combined with alcohol, increased the intoxication effect significantly.  The woman told police she remembered various moments of Dawson sexually assaulting her, but she could not remember how Dawson got to her residence.  On the morning after the alleged assault, Dawson and the woman exchanged further text messages in which he denied having sex with her, the court document says.  Detectives interviewed Dawson, who admitted to having sex with the woman and claimed she initiated it.  “When asked why he lied to [the alleged victim] about having sex, he stated he was afraid she was trying to “pin” something on him,” the document says  Blood/alcohol testing on the woman indicates she still had .04 percent alcohol in her blood 10 hours later, and her blood/alcohol content could have been between .14 and .29 percent at the time of the alleged assault, according to the document.  Police tried to contact Dawson again on March 28, but were unsuccessful in locating him. A USU spokesman said Dawson was suspended from all football activities after school officials learned of the investigation.  Last week, another former USU football player was sentenced to 26 years to life in prison for multiple rapes.  Watch FOX 13 for updates as they become available.<|im_end|>

# Plug-And-Play Spacecraft Take A Leap Forward

CubeSats have opened up low Earth orbit in ways that we couldn't have imagined since the first ones launched in 2003. They've ushered in a revolution of small spacecraft, each optimized to carry out a specific mission using small computer components and electronics.  For months or a few years at a time, they circle the planet in swarms, gathering information below on the weather, ship movements, resources, natural disasters and more -- providing faster real-time access to information about our planet than the larger satellites ever gave us, although the tradeoffs can include lower resolution photos and electronics less hardy against space radiation.  CubeSats have also set a customer expectation of customization -- an ideal of a company providing a spacecraft platform, and then customers picking and choosing the components that they wish to fly at incremental additional costs. Much like picking a car, you'll have the "standard" option and then your extra wishes can be satisfied at extra cost.    That's where York Space Systems comes into the space. The startup is new, so new that most of its financial and launch information is still in stealth mode. But what is known for sure is its S-CLASS spacecraft platform is en route to a launchpad for a ride on an undisclosed rocket, at an undisclosed time.  First, a few words about the York platform. It's a three-axis stabilized spacecraft that can carry payloads of up to 85 kilograms in mass. In future, it will be the backbone spacecraft type for constellations and also for ride-sharing, which is a popular option to cut costs for launches. (Ride-shares see smaller satellites piggyback with a larger, main satellite that might be for government or military purposes.)  The company was founded in 2015 and in the past 18 months, has grown its company from 10 people to 21 people, all in the Denver area. They anticipate additional growth in the coming months, but cannot say yet if they are profitable or by how much their revenues are growing year-over-year. All funds to date have been bootstrapped, and CEO Dirk Wallinger is coy about whether any Series A funding is planned.  "The platform for York is about demonstrating different technology," he said in an interview, adding that its strength is being able to pivot to all sorts of different missions. Undisclosed customers have already bought into the concept, which can be deployed for applications including Earth observation, communication and weather.  The S-CLASS platform can also be moved to any orbit inclination or orientation, without expensive redesigns, which means it could be used for anything from military surveillance (which tends to require polar orbits) to monitoring ship traffic near the equator. It can even zoom up to geosynchronous orbit (a common orbit for communications satellites), although that would require extra propulsion modules to deorbit out of these valuable slots, which are highly coveted worldwide. The protocol is for companies to move their satellites away when the platforms exhaust fuel.  Recently, S-CLASS finished environmental testing to get ready for launch, including tests for electromagnetic interference, vibration randomly distributed across three axes, and thermal vacuum tests to simulate the space environment.  "We were putting it through torture," Wallinger joked. "We are most happy that we didn't have any failures at all. It was pretty much good across the board, and we're really happy with how the platform performed."  Wallinger said the company is planning on targeting government contracts in the future, since he and others have done work for the government in the past. For now, their customers are analytics customers that use machine learning and artificial intelligence to pull "new things" out of the data collected from space, Wallinger said. Using technology instead of people to parse the data will reduce cost, he added.  York is also banking on what they think will be the trend in satellites in the future. While traditional satellite series such as Landsat tend to make their data available for free, Wallinger said as information becomes more specialized, it would also be more valuable. Therefore, many commercial companies will prefer to sell their data as another revenue stream, and that's something York wants to do as well.  More information about the first S-CLASS rocket ride, customers and mission will be forthcoming in the next few months, company officials said.<|im_end|>

# These Market-Beating Shares Deserve a Franc Debate: Taking Stock - BNN Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- The equity rally still has legs judging by the price action of yesterday, with traders buying and covering on any weakness, and futures pointing to a higher open again this morning. While investors seem to have regained an appetite for risky assets, it’s surprising that a defensives-heavy index like the Swiss SMI has kept up with European peers this year. Novartis, Nestle and Roche account for about half of the benchmark, and they have performed well so far in 2019. So how does the country’s currency play into this? The franc is popular among investors at times of heightened market stress. It hit a 20-month high against the euro last week and is hovering near the 1.12 euro key level. Investors usually turn to the currency when sentiment is souring, which could be a sign that concerns are mounting. In fact, forex options traders are betting on further gains for the franc. The strengthening of the franc could become a problem for Switzerland’s exporters, notably its manufacturers. Kepler Cheuvreux highlighted recently that companies with high sensitivity to fluctuations in the currency include Straumann, Sonova, Partners Group and Georg Fischer. Swiss watchmakers could also be sensitive, especially as the demand for luxury watches has been slowing. This could become a potential drag for Richemont and Swatch, with about 20 percent and 23 percent of sales in Europe respectively. Since 2015, the Swiss National Bank has used a deposit rate of minus 0.75 percent and pledged to wage interventions, if needed, to maintain the interest rate differential with the euro area and keep the franc from appreciating. SNB’s Governing Board Member Martin Schlegel said earlier this week that the bank still has room to ease monetary policy, and Kepler Cheuvreux sees a surge beyond 1.12 franc per euro as “unsustainable,” as the SNB won’t tolerate a strong Swiss franc. Makor Capital Markets strategist in Geneva, Stephane Barbier de la Serre, says the SNB stance explains the actual floor, but thinks the franc is “quietly, discreetly, almost stealthily” breaking the key support against the euro. The strategist sees no particular trigger, just another demonstration of the ongoing endless appetite for defensive assets, saying that the next medium-term target for the franc is 1.1060 per euro. Is there a balance between the defensive features of the Swiss currency and the protective profile of Swiss equities? As the pound can weigh on the FTSE 100, there could be a point where Swiss stocks become less attractive because of the currency’s strength against the euro. They have managed well so far. In the meantime, Euro Stoxx futures are trading up 0.7% ahead of the open. SECTORS IN FOCUS TODAY: Watch the pound and U.K. stocks after Theresa May reached across the aisle for cross-party talks to help work out a joint plan that would stand a chance of getting approved by Parliament, while planning to ask the EU for a further delay. Watch miners as iron ore prices surged again on increasing supply concerns, after Brazil’s mining regulator ordered that 56 tailings dams should close. Watch shares in companies like BHP, Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Ferrexpo among miners and keep an eye on steel stocks including ArcelorMittal and Evraz. Watch trade-sensitive sectors after U.S.-China talks kick off again Wednesday and after a report that the U.S. and China have ironed out most of their differences in trade negotiations. COMMENT: “Global equities had a strong run in Q1 and recouped most of their losses from October-December,” Barclays strategist Emmanuel Cau writes in a note. “The bulk of the rebound is likely behind us and our year-end targets imply limited upside from the current levels. However, we continue to find the risk-reward for equities more attractive than for bonds, and advise using the cheap volatility to hedge downside risks.” COMPANY NEWS AND M&A: UniCredit Is Said Near $900 Million Sanctions Accord With U.S. Carlos Ghosn to Be Re-Arrested by Japan Prosecutors, Sankei Says SAS May Order Additional Narrow-Body Aircraft in Long-Haul Push Dermapharm Full Year Revenue EU572 Mln Novartis’s Sandoz Resubmits Pegfilgrastim To FDA After Prior CRL Equinor CEO Says Higher Oil Prices Putting Pressure on Costs: DN Trelleborg CEO Says Demand Continues to be ‘OK,’ DI Reports Roche Extends Offer for Spark to May 2, Terms Unchanged Santhera Considers Options to Monetize Assets for Addl Funding Shop Apotheke Sees Full Year Revenue About +30% Rockwool Faces Local Opposition to Factory in West Virgina: DR Nilfisk To Focus on Optimizing Consumer Business After Review Total Invests $700 Million in U.S. LNG With Tellurian Agreement Daimler, BMW Narrow Talks to Compact Electric Car: Sueddeutsche BMW Pulls Ahead of Mercedes in U.S. Luxury Race as Lexus Gains Santander Tweaks Corporate Governance After Orcel: Expansion NOTES FROM THE SELL SIDE: RBC says more visibility on earnings will be needed for European investment bank shares to re-rate from what are currently optically cheap levels. Sector does look cheap but is only attractive if earnings start to recover. UniCredit rated top pick and outperform ratings on ING and BNP Paribas. French banks coverage is reinstated at BofAML with a cautious view, setting Credit Agricole at buy, BNP Paribas and Natixis at neutral and SocGen at underperform. BofAML says in note that even with valuations low as they currently are, they remain unattractive overall as approach late cycle. Cites failure of the French banks to deliver on medium-term targets, says profitability is structurally low, and capital positions are tight. Arkema is the second-cheapest stock among European industrial-chemical makers, although this is fair as reflects concerns about co.’s past and future performance, Berenberg says in note. Broker initiates stock at hold, with PT EU97. Jefferies downgraded Halma’s to hold from buy, saying the share price rally and valuation after “stellar” performance can’t justify its positive view anymore. Expects co. to continue to trade well, but doesn’t see any significant consensus upgrades.

# ONE: ROOTS OF HONOR - 5 Matches That Could Steal The Show From The Main Event

ONE: ROOTS OF HONOR - 5 Matches That Could Steal The Show From The Main Event  The main event battle at ONE: ROOTS OF HONOR is an intriguing one on paper. ONE Featherweight World Champion Martin Nguyen is returning to the cage after missing nearly a year with a knee injury. Immediately upon his return, he will be defending his title against former champion Narantungalag Jadambaa, a 43-year-old Mongolian martial arts pioneer and legend. There is enough there to be excited about without the rest of the main card. However, on April 12, there will be six bouts that precede Nguyen-Jadambaa on the main card. At least five of them has a chance to steal the show from the main event. Eric Kelly Vs. Kwon Won Il Originally, Kelly was supposed to close out the preliminary card with what promised to be an epic battle between him and China’s Kai Tang. The latter has been replaced on the card by South Korea’s “Pretty Boy” Kwon Won Il, who has much less experience, but still possesses a fan-friendly style. The 36-year-old Kelly needs a win in the worst way. He has lost five bouts in a row and every one of those losses has come by stoppage. Another loss, especially in front of his countrymen in the Philippines, just isn’t what Kelly wants to accept. As usual, Kelly will want to take the action to the ground where his grappling and overall experience can take control of the bout. That initial battle to dictate the identity of the match could be fascinating, and the deciding factor in this bout. Edward Kelly Vs. Sung Jong Lee The 35-year-old younger brother of Edward has been alternating wins and losses for the past two years, and he has a very winnable bout in front of him against Sung Jong Lee. Like his brother, Edward likely wants to perform well at home. Lee is a powerful competitor but has usually made a mistake in each of the four losses that have cost him the match. He cannot afford to be careless against “The Ferocious” Kelly. The latter has every motivation to make a statement in this match. If Kelly can win and get the finish, expect the Mall of Asia to erupt.  Luis Santos Vs. James Nakashima Here is where the card could get really good. American James Nakashima comes into his battle with veteran Brazilian striker Luis Santos with an undefeated record. A title shot could be on the line for the winner of this bout. Oddly enough, Nakashima has never had a finish in his mixed martial arts career, and but there is no better time than this event to get his first. Obtaining that will be anything but easy. Santos is one of the most accomplished strikers in the sport and despite his advanced age of 39, he is still a formidable opponent. Santos would love to fight off being saddled with gatekeeper status, but Nakashima would like to blow through the gates and up to the next level in ONE’s welterweight division. We’ll find out a lot about both men by the time this one is over. Tatsumitsu Wada Vs. Gustavo Balart There is a great deal at stake in the Tatsumitsu Wada-Gustavo Balart bout. It is the final ONE Flyweight World Grand Prix Quarter-final match. The winner will have the privilege and task of taking on all-time great Demetrious “Mighty Mouse” Johnson in the next round. Johnson submitted Yuya Wakamatsu in his quarterfinal match on 31 March in Japan at ONE: A NEW ERA. Because of Johnson’s global stardom, the winner of the Wada-Balart battle will find themselves under a more intense microscope than they’ve experienced throughout their careers. Wada is by far the more experienced mixed martial artist with 33 professional bouts under his belt. He’s also competed with ONE Championship three times prior to his bout in The Philippines. However, Balart is an Olympic wrestler from Cuba who has made a mark with an 8-1 record. His ground game is on another level and Wada will have to do everything in his power to keep his back off the canvas. This could be one of the more tactical bouts on the evening. Joshua Pacio Vs. Yosuke Saruta After a competitive and high-octane initial meeting in January that resulted in late-replacement Yosuke Saruta dethroning Joshua “The Passion” Pacio at ONE: ETERNAL GLORY. This bout will be the rematch and both men are determined to take home the victory. Something has to give for Pacio. He has never lost at the Mall of Asia in his career. The proud Filipino warrior is hoping to use the energy from his home fans to regain his title. Japan’s Saruta doesn’t simply want to retain the title almost no one gave him a chance to win, he wants to win even more emphatically than he did the first time when he prevailed by decision. “I won by decision last time, so this time I want to finish, and I want people to understand how strong I am,” the 31-year-old World Champion says. “Last time, I couldn’t fight like I imagined – there wasn’t much ground game. I couldn’t do damage and finish. “This is a sport, so winning by decision is still a win, but I want to knock him out this time.” Will Saruta get his wish or will the Passion even the series at 1-1?<|im_end|>

# Mario Falcone ‘engulfed in parenting row’ as fiancée heads back to work

[Dave Benett/Getty Images]  Mario Falcone has reportedly been engulfed in a social media parenting row after sparking controversy.  The 31 year old’s fiancée, Becky Miesner, took to Instagram to reveal that she will be returning to work five months after the birth of their son.  Becky, 30, and former The Only Way Is Essex star Mario welcomed Parker Jax in November.  [Instagram/Becky Miesner]  The makeup specialist shared the news to her 138,000 followers by uploading a sweet snap of herself alongside Mario on their first date since Parker’s birth.  Top Stories  She wrote: “Little lunch date today for the first time alone since before we had Parker as it’s my last day of my maternity leave.  “Back to work tomorrow and feeling very anxious about it. Been the most amazing and special 5 months of my life bringing my little boy into the world.”  [Instagram/Mario Falcone]  According to MailOnline, a troll “penned a now-deleted comment about their arrangement — leading to an allegedly shocking, also deleted reply from Mario.”  The website goes on to report that Mario was then criticised by fans before Becky stepped in to say: “People are just nasty on social media these days and so unnecessary.”  One fan under the image, referring to Mario’s deleted comment: “There is no need to bring someone’s kids into the comment regardless of your disagreements.  [Twitter/Mario Falcone]  “That’s very low of you Mario I expected better considering your a dad yourself.”  A second added: “I know it’s hard not to retaliate however I’m not sure what the ladies comment was regarding clearly wasn’t nice but his reply is just as pathetic as an influencer etc.”  OK! online has contacted a representative for Mario for comment on this story.<|im_end|>

# Three Things to Know: Westbrook dedicates historic 20-20-20 night to Nipsey Hussle

Every day in the NBA there is a lot to unpack, so every weekday morning throughout the season we will give you the three things you need to know from the last 24 hours in the NBA.  1) Russell Westbrook dedicates historic 20-20-20 night to Nipsey Hussle. Russell Westbrook so often puts up ridiculous stat lines we’ve almost become numb to it. There was a time when Oscar Robertson’s averaging of a triple-double for a season seemed like Joe DiMaggio’s 56-game hitting streak — an untouchable record in the modern era — but Westbrook did it. Then did it again. And is about to do it one more time.  Yet what Westbrook did Tuesday night was mind-boggling by even his standards.  Westbrook had 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 21 assists — the NBA’s second-ever 20-20-20 game. Wilt Chamberlain was the other one.  After the game, Westbrook dedicated the game to slain rapper Nipsey Hustle, who was shot outside his Los Angeles’ clothing store days ago. Westbrook is a Los Angeles guy, and the players from the city know how Hustle gave back and was committed to his neighborhood, trying to lift people up, in a way few celebrities are. He meant a lot to people and the city.  We could nitpick the accomplishment — Westbrook shot just 8-of-23, and he was hunting those rebounds in the final minute — but we shouldn’t try to diminish this singular accomplishment. It is a mind-boggling effort.  Westbrook did this and lifted his team up when the Thunder needed the win, the Thunder beat the Lakers handily. This victory keeps the Thunder tied with the Spurs (who beat the Hawks) for the 7/8 seed in the West. OKC wants to avoid that eight seed and getting the Warriors in the first round because…  2) Golden State flips the switch, dominates Denver, all but secures top seed in West. In this week’s PBT Podcast, Mark Medina — Warriors writer for the San Jose Mercury News and Bay Area News Group — had a great line about the Warriors’ up-and-down effort this regular season:  They care and play hard when it’s convenient for them.  Tuesday night it was convenient.  The Warriors needed a win over Denver to lock up home court throughout the West playoffs, and so they came out and flipped the switch, dominated the game leading by 30 in the fourth (the Nuggets are just a poor matchup with the Warriors), and reminded everyone that the Warriors have gears nobody else in the NBA can hit.  And now they have DeMarcus Cousins at center now — he overwhelmed Nikola Jokic and every other Nugget defender in the paint on his way to 28 points and 13 rebounds. In recent games Cousins has seemed to find a comfort level playing with the Warriors, and that should scare teams heading into the postseason.  Kevin Durant pitched in 21 points in less than three quarters before he got ejected.  (Durant and Draymond Green each have 15 technical fouls this season, if either picks up one more before the end of the regular season they will be suspended for a game.)  Stephen Curry pitched in 18 points. The Warriors are the best team in the NBA when they want to be — when it’s convenient for them. During the playoffs, they will flip the switch most nights, and when they do no team in the West is a genuine threat to them. And the Warriors know it.  3) Warriors finally fire Ernie Grunfeld as team president/GM. Next step is big one for Wizards. One could make a very good case that Ernie Grunfeld should have been fired back in the day when he put together a roster with Gilbert Arenas, Andray Blatche, and Nick Young on it. The team where a gun was pulled in the locker room. Of course, one could make the case Grunfeld should have been fired a lot of times, like when he cleared the books and planned around Kevin Durant coming home in 2016 when that was never a realistic option. There was no “Plan B” after Durant went West, not East.  However, it took 16 years and a season where owner Ted Leonsis thought this was a 50-win, conference finals roster — the Wizards never came close to that dream and are going to finish well out of the playoffs — for him to see the light and let go of Grunfeld. That happened on Tuesday.  What’s next is hard.  Whoever is next in the GM chair inherits a mess of a roster. John Wall’s $171 million supermax extension kicks in next season — a season he will miss much of with a torn Achilles — and runs four years. It is the most untradable contract in the NBA right now. Beyond that there’s Ian Mahinmi‘s $15.5 million, Dwight Howard‘s likely will be on the roster (at $5,6 million), and the talented Otto Porter is gone because Leonsis doesn’t want to pay the luxury tax. Oh, and Bradley Beal may well make an All-NBA team and be eligible for a $199 million four-year extension on top of the two years on his current contract — and the Warriors need to lock him up. He’s their best player (whether Wall returns to form or not).  It’s unclear who comes in. Denver’s Tim Connelly is reportedly a target, but would Washington settle for Nuggets GM Arturas Karnisovas? There are the guys next in line such as Gersson Rosas of the Rockets, Troy Weaver of the Thunder, and Mike Zarren of the Celtics (Zarren is a much longer shot, he will be hard to pull out of Boston). David Griffin’s name will come up. Wizards interim GM Tommy Sheppard deserves a look. That’s just the tip of the iceberg.  What the Wizards need is a creative mind, because it’s going to take one to build anything competitive around Wall’s contract (even when Wall returns he may well not be the same player). Just as importantly, they need a GM who can manage Leonsis, get him to buy in on what could be some painful next steps. In Washington, that may be the hardest part of the job.<|im_end|>

# The urethral dilator market will register a CAGR of over 6% by 2023

NEW YORK, April 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --  About this market Urethral stricture is a chronic disease in which the urethral opening becomes narrow due to injuries, scars, genetic disorders, and infections such as sexual transmitted diseases (STDs). These strictures are a common problem and can be initially treated with urethral dilation. Urethral stricture treatment is driven by the growing number of treatments for kidney stones, prostate cancer, obesity, and other medical conditions where urethral dilators are required. Furthermore, easy insertion and removal of stents and catheters using dilators, without major surgeries. is also driving the urethral stricture treatment. The prevalence and recurrence rates of kidney stones are increasing globally, with a limited choice of effective drugs.

# Council introduced to proposed codes

Rigby Planning and Zoning Planner Sharon Parry introduced a new codes and an amendment to a current ordinance to the Rigby City Council March 21 that she says are needed to assure that organized growth occurs. The new codes include adding an R-Ranch Zone to the city zones as well as developing a historical downtown overlay zone. R-Ranch Zone The purpose of the proposed ordinance is: to encourage the continuance of areas which are characterized by large and very large lots and parcels of sufficient size to accommodate one single dwelling unit and limited agricultural uses, including animal husbandry. The zone is generally intended for rural residential areas which were previously developed in the county and for those new build subdivisions in the Area of Impact that embrace the rural feel of larger lots and limited agricultural use. Parry said there is not a maximum size requirement to be zoned R-Ranch, but the property must be at least two acres. According to a copy of the proposed ordinance, the following uses are permitted: general farm horticulture, home occupation, limited horticulture, personal wireless facilities, private swimming pools, temporary produce roadside stands, existing single-family dwellings and new single-family detached dwellings. Parry said a benefit of the ordinance is that if an agricultural area is annexed, the homeowners could still operate their farm or ranch. The city currently has two types of zoning, commercial and residential. “We embrace our rural heritage, and that is was the R-Ranch is primarily about,” she said. After looking over the proposed ordinance, Councilman Doug Burke questioned if the ordinance should be reviewed by the county. “Is this something we need to run by the county before we do any adoption?” he asked. The council however informed him that adding a city zone has nothing to do with the county. “This has nothing to do with the county,” Councilman Benson Taylor said. Because this was the first time the council had seen the ordinance, they requested that they table a decision until they can read it over and suggest any possible changes. Amending Planned Unit Development Pre-application meetings The proposed amendment would be added clarification to the city’s pre-application meeting subsection. It currently states, “the developer shall meet with the Administrator prior to the submission of the preliminary development plan. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss early and informally the purpose and effect of this Title and the criteria and standards contained herein, and to familiarize the developer with the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance and such other plans and ordinances as deemed appropriate.” Parry suggested, with Mayor Jason Richardson’s guidance, adding a section following “criteria and standards contained herein” that would read: with an emphasis on design review for character, identity and architectural and siting variation, including the required amenities and open spaces/common areas, architectural styles, harmonious use of materials, Fire/EMS safety requirements, storm water retention requirements, design features, landscaping plans, protective covenants, maintenance plans for the land, and all other requirements listed City ordinance 10-11. Since Richardson was not present during the meeting, the council tabled the matter.<|im_end|>

# Global crackdown on access to abortion will cost women their lives

It’s not fake news: Public support for abortion rights in the United States is as high as we’ve seen in years. While Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation stirred the national debate over Roe v. Wade, today’s fight for abortion access rests with the states. Indeed, several states have considered and passed extreme restrictions intended to erode or overturn Roe v. Wade, from efforts in Iowa, Missouri, and Ohio to ban abortion at six weeks (before many women even know they are pregnant) to current bills in Indiana and South Carolina that would ban abortion altogether. In Florida, a recently introduced bill would ban abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. But trying to ban a woman’s constitutional right to reproductive care is not enough for abortion opponents, who are going so far as to propose prosecution and prison time for a woman who receives an abortion.  Make no mistake: These proposed domestic policies haven’t happened in isolation. The movement to ban abortion is happening across the world, and its consequences are fatal.  Just look to our neighbors to the south. El Salvador has one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the world, but it was not always this way. Up until 1998, abortion was legal in some cases. That all changed one year later, when the conservative ARENA party passed a law outlawing abortion without exceptions.  The effects of this extreme law were immediate and offer a glimpse into what happens when abortion is illegal: A woman arrives at the hospital with abdominal pain and learns she has an ectopic pregnancy, but doctors refuse to perform an abortion. This was the case of 22-year-old Keyla Cáceres, whose doctors waited until her ovaries exploded and her life was on the line before they took action.  Another woman has a miscarriage at home and is rushed to the hospital. While unconscious, a doctor asks if she had an abortion and calls the police. She is handcuffed to her hospital bed and later sent to prison. Such was the case of 18-year-old Evelyn Hernandez, who is now serving a 30-year prison sentence. Hernandez is not alone. Over the course of 20 years, El Salvador’s total abortion ban has imprisoned more than 25 women and orphaned countless children.  El Salvador is not the only country in the Americas with an extreme abortion ban. A woman recently died from sepsis in the Dominican Republic after being denied an abortion. In Honduras, both emergency contraception and abortion are illegal. Now, some legislators are attempting to pass similar laws in the United States.  Until recently, most opponents of abortion in the United States sought to pass seemingly small restrictions state by state, such as waiting periods, that chip away at abortion access. Now, dangerous efforts to outlaw abortion do not shy away from criminalizing women who seek reproductive care. In Oklahoma, a proposed bill would ban abortion entirely and impose a criminal sentence up to, and including, the death penalty for getting an abortion. A similar bill in Texas was introduced by legislators who expressed their desire to see women jailed for having abortions and doctors jailed for providing them. In Indiana, a proposed bill is so broad that some legal experts believe miscarriages could be considered manslaughter.  While this outright assault on Roe v. Wade is distressing, there is hope.  Since President Trump’s election, women have demonstrated the power of their voices and their votes, and elevated reproductive freedom on their agenda. This has not been missed by many state leaders. In 2018, we saw the greatest number of pro-choice legislation enacted in states in recent years. In January, New York passed the historic Reproductive Health Act to ensure and expand legal protection and access to abortion. New Mexico, Rhode Island and Vermont are advancing bills to protect abortion rights.  This momentum is not isolated to the United States. Last year, thousands of women filled the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina, demanding an end to clandestine abortions. Women and allies across the Americas are unapologetically claiming the right to choose.  Each day, new threats to safe, accessible abortion arise. We must heed the lessons of El Salvador and other countries in the region, and work together to protect a woman’s autonomy over her body. State legislators must continue to protect abortion access, even in the face of misinformation campaigns and false claims by people who want to ban safe, legal abortion. The struggle for reproductive freedom continues, but it is not a struggle in isolation.  Women, no matter their country or their economic status, should not die from an ectopic pregnancy or be jailed for a miscarriage. Our path to a world in which reproductive freedom reigns supreme might not be a straight line, but it is part of a greater struggle for women’s rights everywhere. It’s a struggle we cannot afford to lose.  Paula Avila-Guillen is director of Latin American Initiatives at the Women’s Equality Center. Kelly Baden is director of Reproductive Rights at the State Innovation Exchange.<|im_end|>

# 'Two lives saved' by harbour's cameras

'Two lives saved' by Bristol Harbourside's 5G cameras  Two people were saved from drowning thanks to thermal imaging cameras at Bristol Harbourside, according to those running the pilot scheme. The new technology alerts the emergency services if someone falls in, allowing rescue boats to get to them quickly. Ten people lost their lives in drowning accidents in the city in 2017. The mother of a man who drowned last year said the initiative was a "God send" as it could pinpoint where and when people fall in. The cameras have been installed at locations near bars and clubs in the waterfront area. Sensors draw a virtual barrier line across the water's edge and, if the line is breached, Bristol City Council's control centre is notified through 5G mobile technology. Operations staff can then check the cameras and alert Avon Fire and Rescue. 'Agony of waiting' The system is a result of a collaboration between Bristol City Council and the University of Bristol. Since it was installed last October, two people were saved after they were detected falling into the water. Figures from the Royal Life Saving Society show 31 people drowned in Bristol between 2012 and 2017. Over a quarter of the deaths happened at the Harbourside, and 45% of those were people aged in their twenties. Alinka Gurgul, whose son Jason died after falling in to the water after a night out in May 2017, welcomed the new system. "If they can pinpoint somebody straight away and save their life, then that's good," she said. "If the unfortunate happens, at least they can get their loved one back without the agony of not knowing or waiting, like we had to do."<|im_end|>

# Russian soccer player apologizes for road rage beating

Russian soccer player apologizes for road rage beating  MOSCOW (AP) - Spartak Moscow midfielder Ayaz Guliyev has apologized after he was accused of hitting a pedestrian with his car before getting out and beating him.  Spartak says Guliyev was driving to training on Wednesday when he "got into a conflict with a pedestrian and used brute force against him."  Spartak says "both sides resolved their conflict" soon after.  In a statement on the club website, Guliyev says "I behaved aggressively and admit my guilt." He also apologized to the victim, the club and Spartak fans.  Russian tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets reported the person Guliyev struck was an American and that he had later paid the man's medical expenses for a broken nose.  ___  More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.<|im_end|>

# I'm an American living in the UK — here are the 9 American products I miss the most

Anyone who's lived in another country knows what it's like to miss products that are only available in your home country. I'm American, and two years ago I moved to the United Kingdom to live with my British partner. Here are some of the American products I miss the most while living in the UK. Anyone who's lived in another country knows what it's like to miss products that are only available in your home country. That's what I'm experiencing now. I'm American, and two years ago I moved to the United Kingdom to live with my British partner full time. I'd spent plenty of time in England before I moved there, so I was familiar with the country's culture, its landscape, and even its grocery stores. The first few times around, there was nothing from the States I missed too much, especially because I knew I'd soon be going back to my New York City apartment and anything I wanted would soon be readily available again. However, now that I've lived in England for two years, there are some American products that I get seriously nostalgic for — snacks, toiletries, even medicine you can only get in America. Sure, I could have friends and family still in the US send some over, but it's not quite the same as before. Here are some of the American products I miss the most while living in the UK. America is pretty big on tumble dryers, and while they do exist here, they're much less popular than they are stateside. Instead, the UK tends to opt for washer/dryer combos that utilize steam to (somewhat inefficiently) dry your clothes, or they use clothes horses to hang out damp goods and wait — sometimes even for days — for items to dry naturally. It's a bit of a pain, to be honest. Back in New York, I used to throw in a couple of sheets of Bounce fabric softener into the dryer with my wet clothes and voila! Thirty minutes or so later, they'd be dry and static-free. Not so much the case over here. Talk to any American expat living abroad and they'll likely tell you they miss Little Debbies, even if they didn't even really eat them while living in the US. Perhaps it's purely a nostalgic thing, but the absence of those little delicious snack cakes — Swiss Rolls, Nutty Bars, Oatmeal Cream Pies, and Zebra Cakes, in particular — makes me probably a little sadder than it should. Aleve, the brand name for the pain reliever naproxen sodium, is readily available over the counter in pretty much every American pharmacy. It's saved my bacon on multiple occasions, like when I had to wait several days for a root canal and when I threw my back out. However, in the UK, it's only available by prescription. While I don't often take painkillers and save them for emergency purposes only, this is why whenever I go back to the States for a visit, I always stock up just in case. The UK has plenty of toothpaste despite the bad teeth stereotypes — and there are even some recognizable American brands like Aquafresh and Colgate. However, Crest has never made it over here, which is a crying shame. The Crest toothpaste with baking soda and peroxide is pretty much my favorite toothpaste ever, so not being able to get it here is a shame. I'm not sure if some of the ingredients are prohibited or Crest just never had the desire to expand overseas, but I miss this stuff and need to pick up a few tubes on my next trip back. Again, there's no shortage of soap in the UK, even really good soap. However, if you're a purist like me, the fact that Ivory isn't sold here is a serious shame. I've even been known to be so desperate for a bar of the 99% pure stuff that I've paid an exorbitant amount on Amazon for imported bars to be delivered to me. It smells amazing, it leaves my skin feeling great, and it even floats. What more can you want from soap? Again, this is something that's available at a serious premium via American import sites in the UK, but why it's not sold on supermarket shelves is beyond me. Admittedly, the UK is a bit behind the curve when it comes to flavored (but unsweetened) seltzers and sparkling waters. Perrier and Pellegrino are easy enough to get a hold off, but the natural, sweetener-free stuff like LaCroix is only beginning to be seen as desirable, and the smaller brands which have launched a similar product pale in comparison to LaCroix in taste, price, and flavor selection. I don't know that I ate that many saltines when I lived in America, but I do know that they're delicious and aren't sold here even though they should be. Again, the UK has plenty of crackers, many of which are really tasty even, but the closest thing to a saltine sold here is called a cream cracker, and it lacks the salty crumbliness of an American saltine. Admittedly, Dunkin' coffee is not all that stellar. In fact, I can think of many small American roasters that are way better. However, as a New Yorker whose apartment was literally down the block from a Dunkin' for years before moving, their Iced Turbos (iced coffee with an extra shot of espresso) were a part of my daily ritual that I really miss. The coffee was hardly strong and the service at my local branch was always appallingly slow, but I can't say I don't miss it.<|im_end|>

# Editorial: LPD probe is a reminder of bad times

Donna Perry, the lawyer hired last October to serve as the Lakeland Police Department's new in-house attorney, is out, even as an internal probe of possible misconduct continues. Investigators seek to learn whether Perry and former Chief Larry Giddens engaged in a romantic affair in violation of department rules, as alleged in a complaint filed by a former LPD officer. Until the investigation ends, of course, any assertion about whether said rules were violated is speculation — although circumstantial evidence suggests fire may reside beneath the smoke. City Manager Tony Delgado has told The Ledger Giddens talked about leaving in November, shortly after Perry was brought on board, because of personal issues affecting his home life. When Delgado asked, Giddens reportedly told him his relationship with Perry was platonic. Yet the chief then abruptly announced his retirement in January. And his wife filed for divorce in late February. The complaint, filed by retired sergeant Pat Guity, maintains Giddens and Perry violated agency regulations governing truthfulness, fraternization between supervisors and subordinates and conduct unbecoming, referring to casting the department in an ill light. Perry's decision to leave the department, even before the inquiry was finished, and with an $18,000 severance package, likely was the right one. For his part, Giddens had already stepped down, choosing to retire as of Feb. 1. If the inquiry finds rules were violated, then Perry's departure would have been necessary. Even if she is cleared, though, it's questionable about how effective she could have been operating under clouds of innuendo. The great irony in this, if the two were romantically linked, is that Giddens was elevated to top cop from an assistant chief's post to right a ship that was foundering because of a massive sex scandal, and to deal with that, he established some rules he is now accused of breaking. That scandal, which came to light in 2013, led to 27 LPD employees being disciplined, including three who were fired and about a dozen officers who resigned before being terminated. It also greased the skids for the resignation of former Chief Lisa Womack, and made LPD a laughingstock across the country. The New York Daily News, for example, once referred to LPD as "Florida's Perv PD." If — and we emphasize if — the internal investigation finds Giddens culpable for an adulterous relationship, it would be troubling and beyond disappointing to learn the chief allowed passion and personal romantic interest to overcome his duty to abide by the agency's rules, set an leadership example for his people, represent LPD to the community and protect the department's reputation. That said, though, we shouldn't define Gidden's long tenure in blue by what seems a severe lapse in judgment during his last few months on the job. Giddens gave 34 years of his life to protecting this community. And no one rises to the post of assistant chief in a community of 100,000 residents without serving with distinction. Moreover, Giddens landed the chief's job after the city, when prudence and common sense might have dictated a clean break from the previous administration, conducted a national search for Womack's replacement. Since that promotion, Giddens has worked hard and admirably to restore the department's reputation and refocus it on its core mission — fighting crime, which in Lakeland has fallen noticeably since Giddens was named interim chief in 2014. Guity's complaint is a reminder of bad times at LPD that the community thought it had left behind, and burdens new Chief Ruben Garcia with rebuilding trust and morale. Atop that, Giddens and Perry are both out, and leave it unclear whether LPD has any more disciplinary cards to play against either if the outcome indicates wrongdoing. If Guity's allegation is validated, however, perhaps being out of job and the subjects of ignominy are punishment enough.<|im_end|>

# JP Dirt ‘N Drive Recap, Day 1

It was equal part initiative, anxiety, and elation, but 120 Jeepers received the equivalent of Willy Wonka’s Golden Ticket: a spot on the fourth annual JP Dirt ‘N Drive sponsored by none other than Jeep itself.  The 2019 event is a big one for many reasons. Year four is where events are supposed to be establishing themselves and gaining a reputation. Thanks to the horsepower of JP Magazine, Dirt ‘N Drive’s reputation seems to be coming into its own with the 120 available slots selling out in a matter of hours, proving that magazines are still viable in a digital age.  There’s also Jeep’s return for a fourth consecutive year as a title sponsor, and their release of the Gladiator is not a coincidence. Editor Rick Péwé is leading the trip in a new JT, what most Jeep enthusiasts would argue is the most significant vehicle to be launched for the Jeep brand since the Wrangler.  In addition, Dirt ‘N Drive’s is starting in a new location, this time in the town of Farmington, New Mexico. Long known as a destination for world-class trails and competitions, Farmington has opened its arms to the off-road community, complete with everything from a visit from the mayor’s staff to the driver’s meeting thanking participants for being here and the police escort out of town…and the police aren’t making sure we all get to the county line so we don’t come back.  People from 21 states and two Canadian provinces all descended on Farmington to take part in three days of adventure, excitement, and fun. It’s going to be an awesome few days as we trek our way to Moab, so be sure to watch the hashtag #jpdnd2019 for all the latest updates on social media. Things start bright and early tomorrow, so stay tuned!<|im_end|>

# Local students in state theater finals

The Kingswood Arts Center in Wolfeboro will be the scene of a competition involving students from 12 New Hampshire high schools using a lot of gestures and words and costumes in an effort to capture the crown at the state high school theater festival. Gilford and Franklin high schools will be among the thespian contestants trodding the boards tomorrow and Saturday in the finals of the annual competition put on by the New Hampshire Educational Theatre Guild. Several regional competitions were held in March at Kearsarge, Pinkerton, Salem and Windham high schools, involving 24 schools, all of whom performed one act plays.  The schools moving forward – in addition to Gilford and Franklin – were John Stark, Fall Mountain, The Founders Academy, Kingswood, Salem, Merrimack, Plymouth, Sanborn, Coe Brown and Pinkerton. Plays to be presented ranged from the serious like Authur Miller's classic, "The Crucible," to the playful "Seussification of A Midsummer Night’s Dream" by Peter Bloedel. Gilford chose the Bloedel work, a curious, hilarious amalgam of Dr. Seuss and William Shakespeare. A tale of two lovers is told by the narrators, Chelsea Ammeris and Anna Cook, both of whom were noted as best actresses in the regional competition. Cook, as a freshman, has a background in theater of 16 productions and considers this to be one of her favorite roles. “This and Morticia in the Adams Family,” she said. Anna sees a future on Broadway some day, and loves the "Seussified" pronunciations on stage. “It makes it simple,” she said. Chelsea is a seasoned performer as well, having acted in 14 shows. “I loved playing Audrey in Little Shop of Horrors,” she said, adding that she hopes to spend much of her life in show-biz related positions. Meredith Ellis, 17, is another stage veteran who plays Tatiana and also immersed herself in costume design and selection for the 17 member cast. She won a costuming award at the regional compeition.  All-state performer Ryan Witham plays Nick Bottom and looks at performing as giving him a chance to become somebody else. “It’s a form of escapism,” Witham said, “and so rewarding when the audience shows its appreciation – it makes the effort worthwhile.” A walk through the GHS auditorium shows lots of plaques on the wall that have been awarded to the school’s performers and stage productions over the years. “We do have a long tradition, theater director Grace McLaughlin said, “and this is a terrific, deserving cast.” McLaughlin is part of that tradition.

# Researchers have invented a quieter airplane toilet

Airplane toilets are loud. For some, they are downright terrifying. But chin up, frequent flyers, because a group of Brigham Young University physicists have figured out how to make them quieter.  After two years of trial and error, three academic publications and thousands of flushes, the BYU researchers have invented a vacuum-assisted toilet that is about half as loud as the regular airplane commode.  "People have told us they don't want their kids to be scared to use the bathroom on a flight," said lead researcher Kent Gee, BYU professor of physics. "So, we've used good physics to solve the problem."  It's been a really hard problem to solve, given the industry hasn't been able to improve vacuum-assisted toilets over the last 25 years. That's because getting airplane toilets to flush with very little water requires a partial vacuum, which at 38,000 feet, pulls air at nearly half the speed of sound. (According to research done in Gee and Scott Sommerfeldt's lab, an air-water mix in vacuum-assisted toilets travels more than 300 miles per hour.) When things move at that speed, any disturbance at all to the flow -- like the bend of a pipe or a valve -- generates significant noise.  And now that newer airplanes come with much quieter interiors, toilet flushes reverberate much more throughout the cabin. It can make for very patchy sleep on a red-eye flight on a plane like the Airbus A380 that can have as many as 20 toilets.  "Airline companies have always had standards for the toilet noise, but they've never met those and there has never been much pressure to do so," Sommerfeldt said. "Now with the reduced cabin sound levels, the sound of the toilet flushing is more noticeable and customers are pushing back."  To solve the problem, the BYU team focused on three valve conditions during the flush cycle: the initial noise level peak associated with the flush valve opening, an intermediate noise level plateau associated with the valve being fully opened and the final noise level peak associated with the flush valve closing. The researchers added additional piping to increase the distance between the toilet bowl and the flush valve and made the pipe attachment at the bowl more of a gradual bend as opposed to a sharp 90-degree angle. Tests of the new contraption show aeroacoustically-generated noise dropped up to 16 decibels during the flush valve opening and about 5 to 10 decibels when the valve is fully opened.  "It's a great mix between physics and engineering," said grad student Michael Rose, lead author on the team's most recent vacuum-assisted tech publication in Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics. "The toilet is much quieter and now kids won't think they're going to get sucked out." Along with Scott Thomson, professor of mechanical engineering, the researchers have already filed three patents on the new toilet and are now working with an industry partner to bring it to market. Part of the lure of the BYU invention is that it works with existing airplane toilets -- only the elbow need be removed during a retrofit, while the valve and the bowl stay where they are.  The vacuum-assisted tech could also be used for toilets on cruise ships and trains and even in some new green building projects where housing units are looking at more and more ways to reduce water usage.  "At the end of the day, this is about using science to improve a user experience," Gee said. "It's an important part of making flights more comfortable for customers."  ###<|im_end|>

# Lufthansa loses challenge to EU-approved aid for Frankfurt's Hahn airport

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Lufthansa on Friday lost its court challenge against millions of euros in state aid being granted to Frankfurt-Hahn airport to the benefit of rival Ryanair, after failing to prove the payments dented its revenue or market share. The German carrier took its case to the Luxembourg-based General Court after EU antitrust regulators in 2014 gave the green light to a series of support measures for the airport, which is 82.5-percent owned by China’s HNA Group with the rest held by the German state of Hesse. The support given to the airport, which is only used by Ryanair and Wizz Air, included capital increases totaling 49 million euros ($55.5 million), direct grants and a charging scheme. The German airline argued that many of the benefits of the aid were passed on to Ryanair, which was not paying high enough airport charges. But Europe’s second-highest court said that Lufthansa had failed to show it took a financial hit or lost market share as result of the measures. The airline can appeal at the Court of Justice of the European Union but only on points of law. The case is T-492/15 Deutsche Lufthansa v Commission.

# Jason Day battling through pain with help from wife’s blunt pep talk

AUGUSTA , Ga. — It’s been a trying couple of days for Jason Day.  And yet he was tied for the lead at the Masters entering the weekend.  We all should have his problems.  On Thursday, minutes before his first-round tee time, Day bent down to kiss his daughter, Lucy, and threw out his back in the process.  “Obviously not the way you wanted to start this year’s Masters,’’ he said.  As he limped to the first tee, Day told his caddie, Luke Reardon, “If this stays the same pain as it was on the putting green, I’ll probably end up withdrawing.’’  By the second hole, Day was flat on his back being examined by a doctor.  He played on and somehow shot a 2-under-par 70 while moving gingerly around Augusta National looking like an 80-year-old at The Villages.  On Friday morning, after a night’s worth of chiropractor work, Day woke up in his RV and his back still wasn’t feeling great.  “I woke up and I was disappointed because I thought my back was going to be a lot better than what it was,’’ Day said. “My wife, Ellie … I looked at her and I was kind of moping a little bit in the bath and she’s like, ‘It’s the Masters, you need to suck it up.’  “I can’t complain about it too much. She’s birthed three children and I haven’t, so she’s a lot stronger as a person than me with regards 
to pain. I just hit a little white golf ball around a course.’’ So Day sucked it up, went to Augusta National and hit the little while ball around to the tune of a 5-under-par 67 to take a share of the 36-hole lead along with Francesco Molinari, Brooks Koepka, Adam Scott and Louis Oosthuizen at 7-under.  Sometimes, distractions can be beneficial, and in this case for Day, it might help him win his first green jacket.  “A major, Augusta National, the Masters, everything that goes on this week, how big it is, and the distraction of wanting to win this tournament so bad … sometimes it’s almost a blessing in disguise with regards to it just brings down the expectation of going out there and trying too hard,’’ Day said.  “[Thursday] was great to be able to get through that, and I’m hoping that I can take the same attitude, even though I feel pretty healthy now, into the next two days and play well.’’  Day’s description of his protocol routines to alleviate the back issues that have nagged him since he was a teenager are as fascinating as they are bizarre.  “This is going to sound really weird,’’ he said. “My rib cage is out of position … so I blow into balloons in certain positions to try and get my ribcage down. I flew down to Florida this last week, and I met my trainer and we’re in the pilot’s lounge of this (airport) and there’s two pilots sitting next to me and I’m laying on the ground blowing these balloons up.  “And as you set the balloons go, it sounds like you’ve let one go [passed gas]. So every 30 seconds, I would be letting the balloons out and these guys are looking at me very strange. I’m just doing whatever I can to feel good. So if blowing in balloons is what I need to do to feel good, then I will do it all day long.’’  If blowing into balloons will get Day a green jacket, count him in.  Before the tournament, while speaking to fellow golfer Michael Campbell, Day told him he felt like he’s 31 going on 50.  “Sometimes I wake up and I feel like I’m 50, sometimes I wake up and I feel like I’m 70 and sometimes I wake up and feel like I’m 18 again,’’ Day said. “I feel a lot more optimistic now than I did [Thursday], and I’m hoping that — bar some outrageous thing that could possibly happen — I feel this good going into Saturday and Sunday.’’<|im_end|>

# MSPs fail to attend sexual harassment training

TWELVE MSPs have failed to attend sexual harassment training as the Scottish Parliament aims to tackle the sexist culture of Holyrood - including the SNP politician who alleged his employee was harassed by his former colleague Mark McDonald.  SNP politicians James Dornan, Colin Beattie, Kenneth Gibson, Stewart Stevenson, Shona Robison and Christine Grahame did not attend any of the 78 sessions run in Holyrood over a period of six months. Their colleague Gordon MacDonald was also absent but it is understood he was taken into hospital suddenly when he was supposed to attend. Scottish Labour's Pauline McNeill also failed to attend, as did Scottish Conservatives Murdo Fraser, Gordon Lindhurst and Ruth Davidson, although the latter was on maternity leave. Mike Rumbles of the Scottish Liberal Democrats was also absent from all courses. The 12 were the only MSPs not to attend according to a list of names released by the Scottish Parliament today. The workshops, which were also attended by 94 per cent of Parliamentary staff, but just 47 per cent of MSP staff, were established as part of a programme of work to "influence cultural change" in Holyrood, and address issues highlighted by a 2018 survey which found that one in five parliamentary staff had experienced harassment or sexism. Holyrood's problems with sexual harassment came to light in 2017 when MSP Mark McDonald, quit as a government minister and then from the SNP after admitting sending an "inappropriate" text message to a woman. His former colleague James Dornan also complained to Holyrood’s standards committee about Mr McDonald's behaviour towards a member of his staff. The Aberdeen Donside MSP was later suspended from the Parliament for a month without pay. After the McDonald case, the Parliament set up a confidential reporting phone line, and commissioned a survey of all staff who use the Holyrood building, which more than 1,000 people took part in. One fifth of staff - including one in three women - said they had experienced harassment or sexist behaviour, with those responsible for such behaviour "predominantly male and in a position of authority over those experiencing it". The figures come a fortnight after the Parliament published a new sexual harassment policy aimed at stamping out sexist and inappropriate behaviour at Holyrood and beyond. This was part of the review launched amid the #MeToo movement and high-profile complaints at Holyrood and Westminster. The workshops, which were also held in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Glasgow and Inverness, covered the fundamental principles of a zero tolerance approach to sexual harassment, the law and definitions of sexual harassment and sexist behaviour, how to deal with inappropriate behaviour if you see or experience it and understanding the impact of behaviours on other people. A spokesperson for the Scottish Conservatives said that the MSPs who had not attended "recognise the importance of these workshops but were unable to attend them due to diary commitments. Should the workshops be rescheduled they would, of course, attend.” Commenting on today's figures, a Scottish Parliament spokesman said: “Almost 1100 people - including 90 per cent of MSPs - attended culture of respect training that focused on zero tolerance and what constitutes unacceptable behaviour."<|im_end|>

# 'To save Europe, you have to turn away from the EU,' says Marine Le Pen

Marine Le Pen, President of France's National Rally, told Euronews she wanted her National Rally party to be "a very large group defending nations and opposing this European Union", which she considered to have "failed". Le Pen made the comments to Euronews' Sophie Claudet ahead of May's European Parliament elections. "It is absolutely necessary that Emmanuel Macron be defeated in what can be called the mid-terms", she said. Le Pen explained that if the French president lost the vote, it would send a message that he "cannot continue the second part of his mandate as he started the first", she said. Macron has been facing mounting pressure from the Gilets Jaunes (yellow vests) protest movement since it kicked-off in mid-November over the high cost of living and his pro-business reforms. Le Pen also told Euronews "to save Europe, you have to turn away from the European Union" and said cancelling the Schengen agreement, which allows free movement of EU citizens, stopping "unfair" international competition, and putting an end to free trade agreements, are "necessary to save our territory". You can watch the full interview on Euronews TV at 21:30 CET this Thursday on The Global Conversation.<|im_end|>

# IPL 2019: 3 reasons why SRH have the upper hand over DC tonight

IPL 2019: 3 reasons why SRH have the upper hand over DC tonight  Delhi Capitals will be taking on the mighty Sunrisers Hyderabad in the 16th match of IPL 2019 at their home ground Feroz Shah Kotla. The Delhi Capitals' journey has been topsy turvy so far, where they have won two out of their four matches. They started the season by beating Mumbai Indians at their home by 37 runs, and after that they lost to CSK. defeated KKR in a Super Over, and suffered a shocking collapse against KXIP. SRH on the other hand find themselves in the top half of the IPL points table with a couple of landslide victories and just the one loss. As the two teams get set for their clash against each other tonight, let's look at the reasons why SRH have the upper hand over DC: #1 Devastating opening duo SRH are on a roll with both their openers in top form. In the previous match, David Warner and Jonny Bairstow both scored tons and took the team total to 231. SRH have scored 200+ runs in both their previous games, and these massive scores can be credited to the openers who have unfailingly given them solid starts. Even though Delhi might have the best bowling line-up in the tournament, considering the form these openers are in, the home team's bowlers have to be ultra-accurate with their line and length to stand any chance of stopping them. #2 The deadly Afghan spin twins  Mohammad Nabi and Rashid Khan have played crucial roles for SRH in a lot of matches in the IPL, and the same was the case in the game against the RCB. Nabi completely dismantled the top order of the Royal Challengers and took four wickets in 4 overs for 11 runs. He will be eager to replicate that performance tonight. On the other hand, Rashid is the go-to bowler for SRH whenever they need a wicket or want to slow down the run rate of the opposition. With the game being played at the spin-friendly Feroz Shah Kotla, he would be itching to grab a few wickets tonight. These two spinners can be the difference makers tonight, and could give SRH a massive edge over Delhi. #3 Consistently poor performance by DC's middle order Delhi Capitals have had some good knocks from Prithvi Shaw, Rishabh Pant, Colin Ingram and Shikhar Dhawan. But apart from the above batsmen, the other players have failed to score. The lower middle order has to step up and take the responsibility of scoring some runs in the final overs if the team wishes to cross the finish line. In the previous match, Delhi lost seven wickets in the last four overs and scored just 15 runs. The moment Rishabh Pant got out, the team collapsed like a pack of cards. If SRH get a few early wickets, then the Capitals might find themselves in trouble.<|im_end|>

# Norwegian firm plans to build 11MW Irish battery facility in €1.5bn plan

As part of a €1.5bn plan, Norwegian company Statkraft is looking to roll-out wind farms and a renewables battery facility in Ireland.  One of Europe’s biggest renewable energy companies has big plans for Ireland, following on from its purchase of Element Power last year that could significantly boost Ireland’s clean energy plans.  According to The Irish Times, Statkraft’s president and chief executive Christian Rynning-Tønnesen said that in addition to the €30m wind farm it has just started construction on at Kilathmoy at the Kerry-Limerick border, it hopes to spend a further €1.5bn in the country.  This will include a wind farm located 30km off the Dublin coast capable of generating 500MW of electricity to power half a million homes. However, the company hopes to bring in a partner on this project that could cover most of the estimated €1bn cost.  The reason for this is the company’s focus on on-shore wind farms and renewables technology. One of the most interesting proposals put forward by Statkraft is the construction of what could be Ireland’s first renewable electricity storage facility, also at Kilathmoy. This facility would be able to store 11MW of electricity and would be plugged into the wider grid during high demand.  It also has planning permission for wind farms in various locations across the State capable of generating up to 130MW of electricity. It is now looking for planning permission for additional wind farms capable of generating 150MW of electricity as well as 150MW capacity for a series of solar plants.  “These investments will be of the magnitude of €450m to half a billion,” Rynning-Tønnesen said.  In explaining why the company wants to invest in Ireland, he said that it was due to the Government’s promise that 70pc of all electricity will be sourced from renewables by 2030.  “There are high ambitions here to develop more renewable energy and you have a good wind resource,” the chief executive said.<|im_end|>

# Who will win the ‘Game of Thrones’? The case for Daenerys Targaryen

Her “children” are weapons of mass destruction. She commands an army of steely eunuchs and horseflesh-eating barbarians. She’s bedded the King in the North and bent his knee. Still not impressed? She’s fireproof.  No one is better suited to rule and protect the Seven Kingdoms than Daenerys Targaryen, which may be the kiss of death considering that “Game of Thrones,” like Queen Cersei Lannister, has a history of killing off the most valiant of characters for sport.  Khaleesi, however, is a warrior for our times. She frees slaves, fights an abusive patriarchy, uplifts the downtrodden and makes the 1% pay … dearly. In short, she’s a benevolent queen who flames the competition.  Who else in the series seeks justice above power and is intent on “breaking the wheel” that’s kept the same viper’s nest of royal families in control for centuries? Okay, maybe her main squeeze Jon Snow, but we know who wears the crown in that relationship.  She also looks fantastic in casual, around-the-castle tunics and leather battle gear. But like Dany, let’s stay focused on what’s important: defeating the Night King and his army of dead.  All realms will be plunged into eternal darkness if the Whitewalkers win. The silver-haired whore, as Queen Cersei has referred to her between gritted teeth, could very well be the savior Westeros and the rest of the far-flung lands need. It’s been hinted at more than once that Dany is poised to fulfill the prophecy of The Prince That Was Promised, a savior who will defeat evil, despite the gender specifics of that forecast.  Dany has a birthright to the throne, as does everyone else lined up outside of Kings Landing like planes waiting to land — Snow, Sansa Stark, the ironsmith. And like most of the women in the series, Dany’s had to suffer a multitude of indignities at the hands of mud-caked men to play the game of thrones: child marriage, rape, imprisonment, starvation and more.  But she’s different from the rest of the castle-seeking crowd, and not just because she has the best hair of any character in the HBO production hands down, especially since Cersei’s golden locks were sheared off by religious zealots, who paid for their horrible crime when the Lannister Queen sent them to the heavens via an explosion of biblical proportions (please see Meredith Blake’s argument for Ceresi for more intel on the smirking royal).  She also has more names than the Man from Braavos has faces, though it makes sense that it takes ten minutes to speak her full title. Daenerys of the House Targaryen, first of her name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Realm, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons is too multifaceted to address in one or two titles.  She’s a strong woman and freedom fighter who slays for the people. She’s been vulnerable and unsure of herself, has made mistakes that got her devoted followers killed, has been rash when doling out deadly punishment (sorry, all 163 slave masters crucified back in Meereen) and possesses an ego that’s primed to expand at the prospect of total power.<|im_end|>

# RCB predicted XI vs Kings XI Punjab - one change expected

RCB predicted XI vs Kings XI Punjab - one change expected  Here’s a look at Royal Challengers Banaglore’s predicted XI for the match against Kings XI Punjab. Updated: Apr 13, 2019 16:44 IST Hindustan Times, New Delhi Gasping for breath after six successive defeats, Virat Kohli led Royal Challengers Bangalore will look to snap their winless streak and stay afloat when they take on an inconsistent Kings XI Punjab in a must-win IPL encounter in Mohali on Saturday. Nothing seems to be going right for RCB, who slumped to their sixth straight loss after going down against Delhi Capitals in their IPL match last Sunday. Kohli, who was recently named the Leading Cricketer of the year for the third successive time by Wisden Almanack, will hope that fortunes finally knock at the doors of RCB as they need to win all their next eight matches to salvage any hope of making it to the play-off. RCB have been inconsistent with both their bowling and batting faltering in many occasions. The RCB bowlers had allowed Sunrisers Hyderabad to post a mammoth 232 with centuries from Jonny Bairstow and David Warner before they were skittled out for 113 to lose the match by a massive 118 runs. Against Kolkata Knight Riders, despite AB de Villiers and Kohli scoring 63 and 84 respectively, RCB bowlers failed to defend 205 with KKR riding on Andre Russell’s explosive knock of 13-ball 48 to romp home. Yuzvendra Chahal has been their top bowler with nine wickets but rest of the bowling line-up conceded far too many runs. The Royal Challengers Bangalore team management may make just one change for their next match. Mohammed Siraj, who has an injury concern and also hasn’t been up to the mark in this season, may make way for Umesh Yadav for the match against Kings XI Punjab. Dale Steyn has been called up to join the RCB squad, but he will be available to play only by April 19. Predicted XI: Parthiv Patel (wicket-keeper), Virat Kohli (captain), AB de Villiers, Marcus Stoinis, Moeen Ali, Akshdeep Nath, Pawan Negi, Tim Southee, Navdeep Saini, Yuzvendra Chahal, Umesh Yadav.

# New service station and retail shop approved after two years

New service station and retail shop approved after two years  AFTER more than two years, a service station and retail centre in Yeppoon have now been given the green light. The development application for a service station and retail warehouse at Lot 50 Fred Lawn Dr was tabled at last week's council meeting. The application was first lodged in January 2017 on behalf of Retail Fuel Developments. The process has been lengthy as extra approvals and information were required. Referrals were also made to Ergon Energy and the Department of State Development, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Planning as the development is on Yeppoon Road, a state-controlled road. It was noted in the application the location of the service station would not only attract residents but also the wider locality, tourists and travellers. The development is on a site of 1.969hectares, across from the BP and KFC complex. It comprises a service station with retail warehouse tenancy in the one large building. The building would total 1,373sqm and be 9.5metres in height. No tenants have been secured to occupy the building yet. The building is set back off the main Yeppoon Rd on the northern side boundary. The service state station is to be located east of the retail warehouse building in the central area. The service station would have four bowsers to allow for up to eight vehicles at one time from two underground fuel tanks. It is proposed to operate 24 hours, seven days a week. The site would have a total of 59 carparking spaces throughout. Landscaping is proposed around the site with the total area of landscaping and natural vegetation to be 36 per cent. There has been some issues with access to the site through the application process. The approval conditions sought that Yeppoon Rd access be denied at all times. The centre still has frontage on Yeppoon Rd but access will be from Tabone st. The site is across the road from the BP complex with KFC and the newly built Woolworths service station, along with the Yeppoon hospital, BCF, Ready 24 Gym and Supercheap Auto, The site is on a main road into and out of Yeppoon, providing a third service station option on the roundabout. At the council meeting Cr Adam Belot commended the applicant on finally getting their application approved and he looked forward to it going ahead.<|im_end|>

# Inmate attacked four officers in whirlwind of violence at prison

An inmate attacked prison officers in a whirlwind of violence because he was unhappy at the way he was treated behind bars.  Burly Lewis Grimmerdunne, aged 25, attacked four guards at HMP Dartmoor – leaving two with long-lasting injuries, a court heard.  He armed himself with a pool cue and barricaded himself behind a table during a stand-off with officers.  Grimmerdunne, serving a sentence for a savage drug-related gang attack, suddenly confronted staff because he was unhappy about his status.  One victim was left with a torn shoulder muscle which has left him in pain 15 months on and another still suffers poor vision after being punched in the eye.  Recorder Catherine Brunner QC told Grimmerdunne: “You are here to be sentenced for a terrible act of violence.  “You grabbed a pool cue and struck a wall. You used a table tennis table to keep officers away from you. This was a sustained attack and the harm you caused was very high.  “You attacked prison officers who are doing a difficult job in difficult circumstances.”  The judge jailed him for 18 months to be served at the end of his existing sentence.  Grimmerdunne was due to be released in February 2021.  Now at Exeter Prison, he admitted affray on January 28 last year.  Michael Brown, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said the spark for the violence appeared to be Grimmerdunne’s anger at his lack of privileges at the prison.  He added that the inmate ignored pleas to return to his cell and marched into an office on his landing.  Mr Brown said he there demanded from officer Martin Chater why he was on reduced rights.  The barrister said Mr Chater tried to calm him down but Grimmerdunne snatched a pool cue kept in the office and walked to a stairwell – where he smashed the cue against a wall.  Mr Brown said the defendant used a table tennis table to blockade himself from approaching officers.  He added that he punched Chris Beachus to the right eye.  Mr Brown said Grimmerdunne then threw Mr Chater against a wall and on to the floor.  The barrister said a third officer was grabbed and thrown against a wall.  Mr Brown added that a fourth guard was repeatedly punched to the head.  He said: “Such was the level of aggression that one of the officer deployed a baton and it had absolutely no effect.”  Mr Brown said Mr Beachus suffered an injury to his eye socket, with blurred vision and headaches. He added the officer still had reduced sight.  Mr Brown added that Mr Chater had a torn shoulder muscle which gave him pain every day.  The court heard that Grimmerdunne had been caught with a weapon and committed other offences behind bars which meant he was set to serve his whole seven-year term.  The defendant, last living in the Norwich area, was jailed for seven years for a brutal drugs-related attack in that city.  He held the victim prisoner in a flat and assaulted him with others.  Deni Mathews, for Grimmerdunne, said that his behaviour had improved since the incident in a different jail and he was trying to leave behind his troubled past.

# 5 International destinations to see unique cars

While an afternoon in Toronto’s Yorkville neighbourhood or loitering around the entrance to the Fairmont Pacific Rim in Vancouver may reveal an almost non-stop parade of luxury cars—if not rare supercars, depending the season and your luck—travelling abroad is the real way to satiate your craving for experiencing unique makes and models IRL.  Read on to discover six of the best international destinations for spotting unique cars.  Cuba  Skip the resorts in Varadero and head directly to the capital, Havana, for a more rich cultural experience. Because of the 50-year ban on buying and selling new cars, citizens could only own vehicles built before the revolution in 1959, and ones that had already been imported. This ended in 2011, but the country is still like an automotive time capsule with American classics like Cadillac Eldorados, Chevy Bel Airs, Ford Falcons and Ford Fairlanes in a rainbow of colours all roaming the streets.  Monaco  For an independent city-state with a population just shy of 40,000, Monaco has an impressive number of wealthy residents. One in 56 people have at least $30 million in the bank, the highest per capita in the world. And when you’ve got that much cash, obviously you spend it on exotic cars, like a Lamborghini LM002 — just 328 were produced from the mid ’80s until ’93 and (at least) one lives in Monaco. When you tire of car spotting, move on to super-yacht spotting.  St. Pierre and Miquelon  Due to the marvels of nature and evolution, secluded islands are often home to rare and unique breeds of animals. Just as Darwin explained. But it’s more politics than evolution that’s led St. Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands off the coast of Newfoundland, to its one-of-a-kind automotive makeup. The islands, which are classified as Collective Territory, are populated by odd French imports like Bipper Tepees, Renault Clios and Kangoos and Twingos, alongside North American and Asian imports like Ford F-150s, Nissan 350Z Nismos and Hummer H2 SUTs. Strange and wonderful. Bring a camera, otherwise nobody will believe you.  UAE  While Dubai doesn’t quite compare to Monaco’s wealth per capita, its hyper rich love their cars as much as they love showing them off. In the evenings, the city’s luxury malls like The Dubai Mall as well as Sheikh Zayed Road are known hot-spots to see supercars casually vying for attention. In fact, the automotive spotting scene is so active here, enthusiasts like Ahmad Al Zein are able to dedicate entire Instagram accounts (his is called @instacar_uae) to documenting their finds.  Plus, the Sharjah Classic Cars Museum, which is home to an impressive collection of vintage vehicles and motorcycles, is just a 25 minute drive from Dubai’s city centre and worth the trip for gearheads who find themselves in this part of the UAE.  Iceland  Iceland is home to some of the most spectacular terrain on Earth. And as the least populated country in Europe, its active volcanoes capped with glaciers, rugged coastlines lined with jagged rocks and ethereal moss-covered fields leading to cascading waterfalls can be tricky to navigate.  For decades, Iceland’s citizens have been taking matters into their own hands by developing a style of souped-up vehicle known as the ‘Super Jeep’ to transport themselves and the many visitors that come to witness the nation’s natural wonders from spot to spot. It’s a bit of a bastardization of the brand as most of the off-roaders aren’t even Jeeps—sometimes they’re Mercedes Sprinters with 46-inch tires, other times they’re lifted Ford Excursions with room for 7 to 11 passengers—but it’s really a compliment, because these machines are super-capable, with off-road tires that deflate to crawl over snow and ice, massive suspensions designed to clear the rocky terrain, beefed-up engines, and other emergency equipment in case nature decides to turn on them.<|im_end|>

# Supreme Court stops ArcelorMittal’s payment for Essar

NEW DELHI: Steel magnate Lakshmi N Mittal’s wait for an entry to the Indian market has been delayed once again, after the Supreme Court on Friday stopped ArcelorMittal from making a payment to lenders to buy insolvent firm Essar Steel India. The SC ruling was in response to petitions filed by some banks, including Standard Chartered, which are locked in a fight over how the proceeds from Essar Steel’s sale must be distributed.  In March, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had approved ArcelorMittal’s `42,000 takeover bid for Essar Steel. The NCLAT approval was in line with the order of the Ahmedabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The NCLAT had, last month, directed ArcelorMittal to deposit the bid amount with the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Essar Steel. However, how the money would be distributed among the lenders was still under dispute.  Four lenders with the largest exposure to Essar Steel, namely Edelweiss ARC, State Bank of India, IDBI Bank and ICICI Bank, are part of the CoC. Standard Chartered Bank, one of the unsecured lenders, which has an exposure of `3,500 crore, has been opposing the CoC-approved resolution plan, contending that it favoured the secured creditors.  Under the tribunal’s order, Standard Chartered was allotted only 1.7 per cent of the total admitted claims, while close to 92 per cent of the claims of financial creditors were being recovered. The NCLAT had ruled that the distribution should be done on a pro-rata basis, and Standard Chartered should be awarded its share accordingly. The CoC, however, moved Supreme Court opposing higher payment to Standard Chartered.  A bench led by Justice Rohinton F Nariman directed NCLT to expedite decision on appeals in the case.  
This has temporarily halted resolution of the cash-strapped Essar Steel, which was one among the first 12 cases selected by the Reserve Bank of India for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). It has been stuck in legal disputes for almost two years and has crossed the mandated 270-day period for resolution. Meanwhile in NCLAT 
Upholding the order of NCLT Ahmedabad bench, the NCLAT had in March directed ArcelorMittal to deposit the bid amount of I42,000 crore with the Committee of Creditors  
Standard Chartered, an unsecured lender, who was allotted 1.7% of the total claims while financial creditors were given 92%, cried foul 
The NCLAT ruled that the distribution should be done on a pro-rata basis 
The CoC moved SC opposing higher payment to Standard Chartered<|im_end|>

# 2 QBs ‘a tad bit ahead’ as South Alabama gets set for 2nd spring scrimmage

After one full spring scrimmage and heading into the second, South Alabama offensive coordinator Kenny Edenfield believes he's begun to narrow down the team's quarterback competition. Sophomore Cephus Johnson and junior-college transfer Tylan Morton have separated themselves a bit from redshirt freshman Desmond Trotter and true freshman Tanner McGee, Edenfield said this week. As the Jaguars prepare for their second (and final) scrimmage of the fall on Saturday morning, Johnson and Morton have seen their practice reps steadily increase.  "They're really making it tough on me," Edenfield said. "I would say the two older guys might be a tad bit ahead, but Desmond's right there. "I did narrow it down a little bit, but (Johnson and Morton) got a few more reps than normal. I think we have to do that. But as we get into this second scrimmage, here's what's big — if we can get some more separation like we did, then we can narrow it down a little bit more. But that doesn't mean they can't all get some more work. And they've all been pretty positive about it. They know we can only get two guys ready." In the first full scrimmage of the spring last Saturday, Johnson completed all six of his passes for 66 yards, and also ran for a 2-yard touchdown. Morton hit on 6 of 11 attempts for 82 yards, including a 36-yard touchdown pass to Jalen Wayne. Trotter was also efficient, completing 10 of 12 passes for 64 yards. McGee wasn't quite as productive, but did complete a 43-yard pass to Mo Edwards on one play. "I'm really excited about all the guys I've got," Edenfield said. "Cephus … he was as productive as any quarterback in any scrimmage since I've been here. Tylan Morton has proved time-and-time again, any time we get in a big team situation, he might not always do it right, but he makes big plays.  "Desmond Trotter has been really solid in every decision we've asked him to make. I'm really fired up about Tanner McGee, because Tanner has been here the least amount of time in terms of playing college football, but is going to be a really good player."  After watching film of the first scrimmage, both Edenfield and head coach Steve Campbell noted more physical play from the offensive line, which has been a big emphasis this spring. Both also named redshirt freshman running back Tony Brown as someone who had a particularly good day. The Jaguars defense came up with three sacks and two turnovers in the scrimmage, but also allowed a few more big plays than defensive coordinator Greg Stewart would have liked. Stewart was particularly galled about a 32-yard run by Terrion Avery when the USA offense was backed up to its own 1-yard line. "I think we're getting better," Stewart said. "I thought our execution and communication was pretty good. We're tackling better than we did. … There was a situation where they're coming out from the 1, and we didn't keep them from getting a first down. And that's because we didn't stay in our gaps. That's something you can get fixed, but we need to be disciplined in that part."  South Alabama completed its 10th practice of the spring on Thursday, leaving four more (counting Saturday's scrimmage) before the April 13 Red-Blue spring game at Ladd-Peebles Stadium. The Jaguars will work Tuesday, Thursday and Friday next week, then wrap up the spring with the Red-Blue game. Coming off a 3-9 finish in 2018, the Jaguars certainly have plenty of room for improvement. But Campbell said he's confident his team will continue to improve rapidly as it heads into his second season. “I think we’re getting better by chunks right now,” Campbell said. “That’s good. Every practice we’re getting better at something. I’m fired up about that. We’re making strides. I’ve been pleased with the progress that we’ve been able to make.”<|im_end|>

# IIHS Study: Higher Speed Limits Account for 37k Deaths Since 1993

The study claims a 5 mph increase in the speed limit can lead to an 8 percent rise in highway fatalities.  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reckons higher speed limits are responsible for 37,000 traffic deaths in the U.S. since 1993 – back when the federally mandated speed limit of 55 mph was still in effect. That’s a very bold statement, but supporting the claim is a study done by Charles Farmer, vice president for research and statistical services at IIHS. In the study, Farmer correlates higher speed limits with other factors and comes up with an estimate of how many traffic fatalities would’ve occurred if the limits were lower. Across the board, he believes a 5 mph increase in speed limits causes 8 percent more fatalities on highways, and 3 percent more on other roads. According to a press release from IIHS, the study looked at the number of fatalities per total vehicle miles traveled in a year, then took into account additional factors that affect fatality rates. Among them were the total number of potential young drivers on roadways, seat belt usage, and for reasons we don’t fully understand, changes in unemployment. Farmer then plugged those numbers into an equation, which found that an increase in speed limits correlated with higher fatality rates in all scenarios. Expanded into a 25-year range, the study estimates that 36,760 people could have been saved had speed limits remained at 55 mph across the country. The correlation is certainly interesting to note, but it’s also worth noting that the study relies heavily on estimates and extrapolation. Additionally, on page 8 of the study Farmer mentions difficulties in obtaining some relevant data. Specifically, Farmer says there were “a number of relevant state-specific factors not accounted for in these analyses due to the lack of consistently available data.” Some of the examples mentioned are road improvements, driving regulations, and safety campaigns. Interestingly, the study also lists total fatalities for every year from 1993 through 2017, but it doesn’t discuss the fact that traffic deaths are actually lower than they were when the national 55 mph speed limit was in effect, despite higher speed limits and significantly more vehicles on the road. Specifically, there were 40,150 fatalities in 1993, compared to 37,133 in 2017. After peeking in 2005 at 43,510 in 2005, fatalities dropped significantly to a low of 32,479 in 2011. As for speed, 41 states have speed limits of 70 mph or more, with six states limiting speeds to 80 mph.  This study will be part of a discussion on what the IIHS dubs a “speed problem” at a forum hosted by the IIHS and the Governors Highway Safety Association next week in Charlottesville, Virginia. What are your thoughts on this assessment? Check out the full study for yourself and let us know in the comments below.<|im_end|>

# Run to 'stomp out' bullying slated for Saturday

MARTINSBURG — A run to help spread kindness, discourage bullying, and unleash a spectrum of colors is slated for Saturday morning. The Potomack Intermediate Stomp Out Bullying Color Run is scheduled for 10 a.m. Saturday, with a plethora of features surrounding the run. The run will include food, face paint and other activities, and it begins at Potomack Intermediate School, at 5308 Williamsport Pike, in Martinsburg. People who still need to register are encouraged to come before 10 a.m. Organizers will also be collecting body-care products for the Eastern Panhandle Empowerment Center, in Martinsburg. They’re encouraging participants to bring in body washes, brushes, shampoo and similar products. This is the third year for the run, and last year about 160 people participated, said Lynette Parker, school counselor at Potomack Intermediate School, and coordinator of the run. “It’s to raise awareness about bullying in the area and also to promote kindness,” Parker said, noting that the run begins at the school and moves through the Hammonds Mill area. It’s a non-timed run, she said, with people of all ages running and walking. Online registration is closed, but people can register on the day of the event for $25. Proceeds go to the school’s guidance program. The money may help out with various possible projects, possibly allowing teachers and staff members to help children with supplies they might need. “If they need clothing for a displaced child, they are able to use this money,” said Principal Amanda Billmeyer, citing one example of how the funds may be used. Kimberly Nelson, an enrichment teacher at Potomack Intermediate School, described how the run unfolds. “People come to the center of the field and we (sound) the horn,” Nelson said. Then people release the colors from the packets — cornstarch and food coloring, Nelson noted — and they start on their runs, or walks, in the midst of a cloud of colors. The colors return, Nelson explained, when participants get “blasted with color” more than once along the path — T-shirts temporarily turn tie-dye — and at the end, participants run through a “gigantic balloon arch.” Music will also surround the event, with Andrew Potts donating his time as a DJ. Along the trail, Parker added, children will hold signs that encourage the walkers and runners to keep going, and that also encourage kindness. Among the people helping out with the color run are children from the school’s Kindness Club, a group of about 60 students who perform various service projects and otherwise strive to engender kindness. Several students talked about their work on a recent morning, noting fundraisers and efforts to prepare meals and gifts for people in the community. They also talked about the sorts of behaviors that might help a student who’s struggling. “They can greet you, and show you around and be your friend,” said Alaina Cole, a fifth-grader. Lucy Preshoot, a third-grader, added: “Maybe they’ve had a hard time, and someone could be nice and it could keep spreading around — like the flu but good.” McKenna Kaufman, a third-grader, also mentioned some ways other students can take initiative if they sense someone needs help. “They could cheer you up, and they could play with you at recess and sit by you,” she said. The students were identifying an antidote to the sort of behavior Nelson said constitutes a kind of quiet — but hurtful — behavior. Sometimes, Nelson said, students might shun another student, or purposely avoid including a student in play. The students seemed to understand that sort of behavior, and to pose considerate alternatives that involved actively reaching out to someone who — as Lucy put it — may be having a hard time. Saturday’s run, too, marks an effort to reach out to the community and to cultivate the sorts of friendship young students such as Alaina, Lucy and McKenna understand to be vital.

# Strong Start gives Pérez and Racing Point Opportunity to Score in China - The Checkered Flag

Sergio Pérez felt positive about the result of the Chinese Grand Prix at the Shanghai International Circuit on Sunday, with the Racing Point F1 Team racer able to secure four points thanks to an eighth-place finish.  The Mexican had started twelfth after missing out on a Q3 appearance on Saturday but made a super start to run inside the top ten, with Pérez able to bring home the car in eighth for his second points finish of 2019, finishing just behind Renault F1 Team’s Daniel Ricciardo.  “I’m very happy to score four points today,” said Pérez. “The start was fantastic: I saw a gap, went for it and it paid off.  “Our race pace was good: we were able to maintain the pace and manage the tyres well.”  Pérez remained firm in the second half of the race despite pressure from behind from Kimi Räikkönen, with the Mexican happy to bring home the car inside the top ten despite knowing coming into the weekend it was never going to be a track suited to their RP19.  “It wasn’t an easy race, though, because I was under pressure from Kimi for most of the second stint, which made it more difficult to look after the tyres and keep up the pace,” added the Mexican. “It was the same with Daniel [Ricciardo] ahead of me – I think he was working hard to manage his tyres because every time I got close to him he found the pace to pull away again.  “This was never going to be our strongest track so it’s important to take opportunities such as today and keep scoring points. I think we have the potential to be stronger at the next race in Baku.”<|im_end|>

# A nurse from New Zealand was kidnapped by ISIS in Syria more than 5 years ago. Her abduction was just made public for the first time.

source (International Committee of the Red Cross)  A New Zealand nurse was kidnapped by ISIS more than five years ago, the Red Cross revealed on Sunday. Louisa Akavi and two Red Cross drivers were abducted during a medical mission in Idlib, northwestern Syria in 2013. The aid group ended a media blackout on the case because there are “new and different opportunities” to find Akavi after ISIS lost its last territory in Syria, a spokesman told Business Insider. Akavi was seen alive as recently as December, but there is no information on the Syrian drivers. Visit INSIDER.com for more stories. A Red Cross nurse was kidnapped by ISIS more than five and a half years ago, the aid group revealed on Sunday, ending a strict media blackout on the case.  Louisa Akavi, who is originally from New Zealand, and two of the aid group’s drivers disappeared in Syria during a trip to deliver medical aid in 2013, Matt Morris, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told Business Insider.  Akavi was seen alive as recently as last December, but the whereabouts of local drivers Alaa Rajab and Nabil Bakdounes remains unknown, he said. It is the longest abduction the ICRC has experienced in its 156 year history, the group said in a statement. The New Zealand government and the ICRC first kept Akavi’s kidnapping a secret, fearing that sharing her name and nationality would compromise her safety. But the collapse of ISIS’ caliphate has prompted the aid group to publicize its search.  “Because we have received credible information of Louisa’s wherabouts and ISIS has lost its last territory in Syria, we believe there are new and different opportunities to find her,” Morris said.  The ICRC made the difficult decision to publicize the case, so witnesses could come forward with any information they might have on Akavi, Rajab, and Bakdounes, he added.  “We also want them to know that we never stopped looking for them.”  At a press conference Monday, New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that “it would be preferable if the case was not in the public domain,” The Associated Press reported.  The government continues to cooperate with the Red Cross to help find Akavi, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.    source (Screengrab/International Committee for the Red Cross) The 62-year-old nurse went missing near the northwestern city of Saraqib in October 2013, Morris said.  She was returning from a medical mission in Idlib with Rajab, Bakdounes, and four other colleagues when their convoy was attacked by masked gunmen. The gunmen abducted the group, but freed the four colleagues the next day.  Since then, the ICRC has only received sporadic information about Akavi, according to the spokesman. The aid group believes she was swapped between armed groups before she ended up in the hands of ISIS.  Witnesses from camps for internally displaced people have sighted the nurse continuing to provide medical care.  “That shows what a remarkable person Louisa is,” said Morris. “She believes in helping people no matter who they are, no matter what their affiliations are, no matter what is being done to her.”  Akavi’s has worked 17 missions in more than 30 years with the ICRC.  In 1996, she survived an attack that killed six of her colleagues in Chechnya. Even after this traumatic experience, she decided to continue working with the Red Cross, Morris said.<|im_end|>

# An Anarchist's Refreshing Approach to Running a Business

Ari Weinzweig believes aspiring leaders should never sacrifice their core beliefs in order to achieve success. On the contrary, they should embrace and celebrate these beliefs, then use them to ignite their organizations.  After all, how can entrepreneurs expect to make an impact if they simply trudge down the same path blazed many times before? Not only has it already been done—it’s also missing authenticity. Ari believes there’s a better way to do business, and that’s by being yourself—completely.  The co-owner and co-founder of Zingerman’s Community of Businesses, Ari is also the author of books including the Zingerman’s Guide to Good Leading series and the Zingerman’s Guide to Good Eating, a contributor to magazines like Fine Cooking and Food and Wine, a recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from Bon Appetit, a mentor, a noted speaker and so much more.    However, a quick conversation proves Ari’s success has never gone to his head. Casually peppering his words with profound insights from his favorite anarchist authors or leadership lessons, Ari’s perspective is refreshingly honest, down to earth and transparent. He’s also proof that running a business your own way can work—we just need to be courageous enough to defy the status quo.  “Most of us continue to do every day what we've been trained to do,” Ari says, “until one day, we realize there's another way to do it.”  Ari didn’t always have entrepreneurial ambition. In fact, after graduating from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Ari just wanted to pay the bills so he could avoid moving home to Chicago. That’s what led him to take a job as a dishwasher at a local restaurant.  As he learned the inner-workings of the food industry, Ari started making his way up the ladder, eventually landing a managerial position. He also met Paul Saginaw, who would later become Ari’s partner at Zingerman’s.  For several years, Paul and Ari traded ideas about someday opening up a place of their own. Then, after space in a historic building opened up, they decided to grasp the opportunity.  In 1982, Ari and Paul opened the doors of Zingerman’s Deli with two employees. With a steadfast commitment to extraordinary ingredients, a strong tie to the local community and a creative-minded culture, Zingerman’s was instantly a resounding success.  Since then, Zingerman’s expanded not by replicating the deli, but by integrating their mission and guiding principles into entirely new local businesses including a coffee house, bake shop, catering company, training center, creamery and more. They named it the Zingerman’s Community of Businesses.  Over 35 years and 700 employees later, the Zingerman’s Community of Businesses continues to thrive and currently boasts over $65 million in annual revenue.  Ari Weinzweig loves anarchy. He’s spent countless hours browsing the University of Michigan’s Joseph A. Labadie Collection of anarchist literature—one of the nation’s largest—and applies his gained wisdom to his life and his business practices.  But don’t confuse his brand of anarchic ideology with any preconceived notions involving chaos, destruction or tearing down the government. Instead, his brand of anarchy is about all about equality, community and refusing to “follow the rule because it’s the rule … I don’t think anybody really likes being told what to do,” says Ari.  Still, when it comes to the corporate world, aspiring entrepreneurs often conform quickly to expectations, as if giving up their past ideals is the necessary price of achieving success. Ari wholeheartedly rejects this mindset for himself, for others and for his organization.  “[There’s] this weird incongruity between like, it's good to be a free thinker and you should make your own decisions—but not that one,” says Ari. “It's no different [at Zingerman’s]. We want people to develop, grow and pursue their dreams.”  He supports his employees’ individual freedom, even if that means openly discussing a future path that leads away from the company. “Sometimes their dream is to leave, which I'm okay with,” he says. “It's not necessarily what I wanted—but ultimately it is what I wanted.”  “What you believe alters what you see or experience,” says Ari. From personal relationships to corporate leadership, our beliefs influence everything in our lives. What we believe not only affects our own choices, but the actions and emotions of everyone around us. Positive beliefs create positive outcomes, while negative beliefs create the exact opposite.  For example, if an anxious new hire believes their manager dislikes her—and the manager’s neutral or negative attitude does little to convince her otherwise—the new hire will assume the lack of positive feedback means those assumptions are correct.  Maybe there’s validity behind the new hire’s concerns. Maybe there’s none. Either way, she’s going to internalize those feelings. Those feelings will manifest as action. As the stress mounts, her demeanor flounders and work suffers. Whether or not the manager actually had negative feelings becomes irrelevant, since the new hire’s reaction hinders her performance regardless.  Ari calls this a self-fulfilling belief cycle.  “The self-fulfilling belief cycle is just what it sounds like,” Ari says. “We self-fulfill into creating much of our reality. I'm not saying we create all the problems, but a lot of the things that are going on in our lives start with our own beliefs, not with other people's behaviors.  “Part of that is realizing that we all filter information based on what we believe. We filter out all the information that doesn't support our beliefs … or you actually go seek out information that supports our beliefs.”  Sure, positive thinking on the new hire’s part could’ve changed the cycle. But if the manager instilled more positivity, everything would’ve changed as well. After all, isn’t it the leader’s role to inspire?  Let’s be the leaders that set our people up for success. By confidently believing in them, they’ll believe in themselves as well.  “If people looked at their lives and their organizations like they were creating art, they would start to notice a lot more. They would probably be a lot more mindful of what they do.”  There’s a divide between the arts and the corporate world. Many leaders believe in the already defined structures that keep companies running, and think that creativity is a skill best reserved for the weekends.  But what if thinking so rigidly keeps us from seeing the whole picture? By following the same rules and same routines, are we too hyper-focused on getting things done instead of doing them better? What if creativity is what makes a good business great?  Ari believes all business leaders can learn from artists. That’s not to say all CEOs should necessarily sign up for painting classes. Instead, think about your organization as an elaborate song with countless tiny, yet essential, parts. If one note is flat, the piece falters. If every note is flat, the song turns into a disaster.  “A painting isn't this instantaneous creation. It's an enormous amount of work over an extended period of time. A song doesn’t just doesn't emerge finished … they're still paying enormous attention to what all of those little things are.”  “People who go into [business] only for the money rarely create great art,” says Ari, and it’s usually true. Leaders need to tap into the joy of building something for the love of it—not just for status or wealth. And wouldn’t leadership be more interesting—and more fun—if tasks were treated as creative exercises, rather than just obligations waiting to be checked off a list?  The best creatives trust their instincts and they trust themselves. “My strong belief is that everybody in their hearts [knows what] what they want,” says Ari. It’s a mentality he holds as dearly today as he did as a young anarchist in 1982, and it’s not going anywhere.  Want to hear my entire conversation with Ari Weinzweig?

# 200 people possibly exposed to measles at California emergency department ⋆ The Savage Nation

USA TODAY:  A Sacramento, California, medical center sent about 200 patients letters saying they might have been exposed to measles after a girl who visited the emergency department was diagnosed with the highly contagious infection.  The young girl with measles visited the Emergency Department at UC Davis Medical Center on March 17, the center told USA TODAY on Thursday. The letters were sent March 25 and 26.  “You will need to notify your primary health care provider(s) and your child’s provider(s) of this possible exposure to discuss your possible risk of infection, vaccination history, and other questions you may have,” the letters read.  The Bee reported the unvaccinated girl from Calaveras County was diagnosed with the measles after medical staff from another medical center said she likely had the flu or a cold virus.  A 7-year-old boy who suffers from a terminal illness was seen in the same room as the girl with measles before doctors closed the room to be cleaned, UC Davis’ Chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Dean Blumberg told CBS13. The boy was not showing signs of the measles as of his last evaluation on Tuesday, Blumberg said in a statement.<|im_end|>

# Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe resigns, says he needs to ‘recharge’

Khulu Phasiwe, the spokesperson of Eskom, has announced his resignation from the power utility.  It’s been a dreadful year for Eskom, with operational inefficiencies, crumbling infrastructure and dire financial burdens plaguing the state owned enterprise and, as a result, the South African public alike. The stress and frustration born out of load shedding – a symptom of Eskom’s grievous ineptitudes – has taken a severe toll. For Khulu Phasiwe, the burden has become too heavy to bear.  In the early hours of Friday morning, following recent promises of improvement made by Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan, Phasiwe reached the end of his tether. The spokesperson, who has, undoubtably, been under immense pressure as a result of Eskom’s failures, sent a WhatsApp message to his close confidants, announcing his resignation.  Spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe is leaving Eskom   This is to confirm that I am currently serving my resignation notice at @Eskom_SA, and that my last working day will be on 30 April 2019. I'd like thank Eskom for entrusting me with the huge responsibility of being the national spokesperson of the company over the past 5 years. pic.twitter.com/zvV12GEwCr — Khulu Phasiwe (@KhuluPhasiwe) April 5, 2019 Quoting various biblical versus, Phasiwe stated that he would “take some time off to relax and recharge, no pun intended”. The spokesperson also thanked his colleagues and friends for their support during a particularly dark time. Shortly after the news broke, Phasiwe took to Twitter, confirming the announcement made during his early morning rant, saying:   “This is to confirm that I am currently serving my resignation notice at Eskom, and that my last working day will be on 30 April 2019. I’d like thank Eskom for entrusting me with the huge responsibility of being the national spokesperson of the company over the past 5 years.” Eskom load shedding will be mitigated, says Gordhan  The recent crisis at Eskom reached a climax in March, when the utility implemented consecutive Stage 4 rotational load shedding procedures. In addition to the inconvenience caused by protracted powerlessness, it’s estimated that unserved energy costs ripped upwards of R20 billion from the local economy.  Minister Gordhan, who addressed the media with a progress report on Wednesday, assured South Africans that load shedding would be mitigated during the winter months.<|im_end|>

# Buttigieg Heads To Hollywood As He Seeks Campaign Support: Report – True Pundit

Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg reportedly hit up Hollywood over the weekend, meeting with industry elite to garner support for his campaign. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg traveled to L.A. to meet with potential contributors to his campaign following his announcement to run in the 2020 presidential election. Buttigieg officially entered the race Jan. 23 and had little name recognition, but has jumped in some polls since then. Buttigieg, 37, is a former naval intelligence officer, openly gay and speaks seven languages. The mayor stopped at Brillstein Entertainment Partners in Beverly Hills, and spoke with roughly 40 employees about universal health care, the Mueller report, climate change and tech monopolies, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “I want the Republican party to spend the next generation with a very bad taste in its mouth about having let this happen,” Buttigieg said, according to the Reporter. “We are all craving politicians who can bring us together,” Brillstein manager George Heller told the Reporter. “A lot of Dems seem to speak to only their own party, and I think Pete is more transformative and reflects a part of the country that most other Dems cannot access.” Buttigieg got together with the founder of K5 Global, a media and finance advisory firm, according to the Reporter. He also recorded a segment on Bill Maher’s HBO show “Real Time.”View image on Twitter Actor Bradley Whitford and TV writer and podcaster Ira Madison III tweeted about meeting Buttigieg.View image on Twitter While Buttigieg began as and remains an underdog, he has gained major traction in recent weeks. A poll put Buttigieg in third behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders among Democratic Iowa voters. “Pete Buttigieg is more likely to be the Democratic nominee than Joe Biden, according to PredictIt,” statistics site 538 founder Nate Silver tweeted Monday. Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, both 2020 hopefuls, also made appearances in L.A. over the weekend. The two candidates appeared at the NAACP Image Awards and the Human Rights Campaign gala, according to the Reporter. Buttigieg’s campaign did not immediately respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

# Kovac confirms Neuer has suffered another calf injury

Niko Kovac has confirmed Manuel Neuer suffered an injury to the same calf that kept him out of action earlier this month in Bayern Munich's 4-1 win over Fortuna Dusseldorf on Sunday. The Germany international pulled up early in the second half after slipping while attempting to make a pass and was replaced by Sven Ulreich. Neuer missed Bayern's DFB-Pokal quarter-final win against Heidenheim on April 3 but was fit enough to feature in his side's 5-0 thumping of title rivals Borussia Dortmund last weekend. Speaking after the game, though, Kovac says the 33-year-old – who missed almost the entirety of the 2017-18 season with a broken foot – has damaged the same calf that previously troubled him. "It's the same calf that he had problems with last time," he said. "We'll examine it tomorrow [Monday] and hope, of course, that it's nothing serious." Bayern's win over Fortuna lifted them back above Borussia Dortmund at the Bundesliga summit by one point with five games remaining.<|im_end|>

# Amazon to soon launch ad-supported free music streaming service: report

Amazon might launch a new free music streaming service soon, reported Billboard. The new streaming service could include a limited catalogue of music and will be marketed through the company’s Echo line of smart speakers.  According to the report, the streaming service will be similar to its Amazon Prime Music service. It will be available across platforms free of cost, but will support ads and will compete against Spotify’s free music streaming service option. The new service will allow users to skip the sign-up process as well.  The new streaming service will rely on music label licenses to stream music. The company will offset the cost this through ad-revenue and the potential increase in the sale of the company’s Echo hardware, says the report.  Currently, Amazon offers its Prime Music streaming service along with Prime Video, shipping benefits and more under its Prime subscription service in India. It offers two types of memberships to customers – a monthly membership priced at Rs 129, and a yearly one priced at Rs 999.  The report does not state when the company will be launching the service or which regions will it be made available in.  In the US, the company provides its customers with various pricing tiers for its music streaming service. The cheapest is the $3.99 (approximately Rs 276) service for people listening to the music on their Echo devices only.<|im_end|>

# Hapton residents scoop amazing £90,000 Lottery win

One street in Hapton is £90,000 richer after three neighbours celebrated winning the People’s Postcode Lottery this weekend.  
Schoolhouse Fold residents scooped £30,000 each, after their postcode BB11 5PT, was announced as the winner of People’s Postcode Lottery’s Street Prize on Saturday. Patricia Knowles (79) and her husband Eric (86) were over the moon when Patricia was presented with a cheque for £30,000. She said: “It’s only just starting to sink in. We only started playing when we moved here three years ago – I definitely picked the right postcode!” Patricia, a retired watercolor artist, isn’t a big shopaholic, but with a big birthday coming up she thinks she might treat herself: “I’m turning 80 soon so I might need to have a little party. I’ve never been a big spender though, so I’ll be giving some of the money to my grandchildren to add to their house saving pots.” Patricia and Eric can’t travel abroad as Eric has been unwell recently, however they won’t let that stop them taking a relaxing break. “We’ll drive around the country and stay somewhere nice – there are lots of lovely hotels nearby so we don’t need to go abroad," said Patricia. Sid Hodson (59) was another lucky recipient of a £30,000 cheque. With a holiday on the horizon the win couldn’t have come at a better time. Sid said: “Wow! This is brilliant! We’re off to Malaysia soon so this will really help out with spending money.” Sid’s wife Judith was also at home when he received his cheque. She was equally as thrilled as Sid about the win, particularly with the prospect of getting a new car. “We’ll use some of the money to trade in Judith’s car so we can finally get one that our springer spaniel fits in," said Sid. When asked why he signed up to play, Sid said: “I love that Postcode Lottery supports charities both large and small. That’s what convinced me to sign up and I’m glad now that I did!” The third winner of £30,000 was unavailable to collect their cheque however the money will be paid into their bank account. People’s Postcode Lottery Ambassador, Judie McCourt, presented the winners with their cheques. She said: “It’s been a great day visiting Sid and Patricia in Hapton today – I’m thrilled for them both. I’m sure they’ll enjoy treating both themselves and their families with their prize money.” With a minimum of 32% from every ticket going to charity, players of People’s Postcode Lottery have now raised more than £416 million for thousands of good causes across Great Britain as well as internationally. This draw was promoted on behalf of Sightsavers which has received over £1 million in funding to date. Arts 2 Heal is one of many charities close to the winners that has also received support from players, and last year it was awarded £5,220 to provide confidence-building art classes for people who are socially isolated due to their mental health.

# Bingu is Legend With A Dream Still Alive - Mutharika - Maravi Express

By James Mwale, MANA  President Prof Peter Mutharika has hailed late brother, and former Head of State, Bingu Wa Mutharika as a hero the country lost, but a remarkable soul with an unforgettable history.  Mutharika was speaking in Lilongwe, Friday, during the 2019 Bingu Memorial ceremony where he also commissioned the former Head of State’s statue which has been erected outside Parliament building.  Urging the nation to “Live the Bingu Dream” Mutharika described his brother as one who was a charming family man, a national legend, and an African statesman.  He said: “Many Malawians who loved Bingu would have loved to see Bingu alive today in this statue. They would have loved to see himself standinga here alive.  “Unfortunately Bingu will never live again. Bingu died but his spirit lives on. The dreamer died but his dream lives on. The visionary died but his vision lives on.”  He particularly lauded Bingu for his ambitions of his country’s economic independence, and his unstoppable passion towards his dreams saying he was one who inspired excellence in others.  He further said in Bingu, Africa ought to celebrate an African statesman who urged Africa to turn its resources into wealth saying his African Food Basket dream inspired many Africans.  “Bingu reminded us that ‘Africans are poor, but Africa is not poor.’ He challenged us to believe that we are a poor people in a rich world – and never to make poverty our choice,” explained Mutharika.  Speaking earlier, Political Advisor to the President, Francis Mphepo, said Bingu would particularly be remembered for his success in poverty eradication and country’s infrastructure development.  He said Bingu was a man who broke regional and tribal barriers by spreading construction of development projects across the whole country.<|im_end|>

# Exit interview: Pennington’s Ipswich arrival was low-key and underwhelming but he leaves as a player of year contender

Exit interview: Pennington’s Ipswich arrival was low-key and underwhelming but he leaves as a player of year contender  PUBLISHED: 06:00 05 April 2019  Archant  Matthew Pennington’s season was caught short by an ankle injury. ANDY WARREN takes a look back at the defender’s time in Ipswich blue.  Town story Luke Chambers was the only fit central defender on Ipswich Town’s books heading into the opening day of this season, following Paul Hurst’s drawn-out and ultimately failed attempt to sign Curtis Tilt of Blackpool. Those attempts continued beyond the deadline for permanent deals and into the loan window, while there were also failed bids for Deji Oshilaja of AFC Wimbledon as Hurst desperately looked for reinforcements following the sale of Adam Webster. So when Pennington arrived as a deadline day loan from Everton, the defender was viewed as something of a stop-gap, third-choice signing. The reviews from his season at Leeds were mixed, but within a few days Pennington had shown signs he was a good acquisition. He trained just once with team-mates prior to replacing the suspended Toto Nsiala in the 1-1 draw with Norwich in September, in which he played well, and has kept those high standards since. His performances, prior to a season-ending ankle injury (suffered when kicking a post in training, rupturing ligaments and leading to surgery) have put him firmly in contention for the Blues’ player-of-the-year award. What went well It was clear from the off that Pennington was the most comfortable Ipswich Town centre-back when it came to playing the ball out from the back. Positionally he’s good, too, using his body well to win the ball from strikers both in the air and on the ground to punch above his 6ft frame. His finest Ipswich performance arguably came in the 1-0 victory over Wigan in December, where he was the pick of the bunch as the Blues held on to secure a rare win. He mastered tricky conditions, defended superbly, dominated in the air and kept a calm head during a nervous ending. He backed that up with another man-of-the-match display a week later, keeping David McGoldrick quiet in a 1-1 draw with Sheffield United, and put in an heroic effort in January’s win over Rotherham from right-back as he imperiously helped deal with an aerial barrage. There was also the last-gasp, goal-saving, tackle on Preston’s Lukas Nmecha in the final seconds of Paul Lambert’s first game in charge. The tackle secured a point and, at the time, felt like it could be a big moment in Ipswich’s season. Sadly that’s not proven to be the case, but is further evidence of Pennington’s contribution. His one Ipswich goal came in the 2-2 draw at Birmingham in September, before being sent-off in stoppage time, but what sticks in the memory will be his ability to block goalbound shots. Pennington averaged a block a game during his season with only three players (West Brom’s Ahmed Hegazi, Chey Dunkley of Wigan and Reading’s Liam Moore) averaging more across the Championship. Areas to improve There has been an over-reliance on loan players at Ipswich in recent years and that’s something Paul Lambert has made a point of trying to change. For that reason there are probably Ipswich fans who took longer to take to Pennington than if he had been a permanent signing, but his performances have won over the majority. The fact he’s been a part of an Ipswich defence which has conceded 64 league goals this season can’t be ignored, of course, and Pennington has had some tricky moments during the course of the season. There have been occasions when he’s lost his man in a crowded box, resulting in goals, while he’s also found some of the division’s bigger strikers a little tough to handle at times. Overall, though, he has been one of Ipswich’s most consistent performers in a torrid season. What the future holds First up for Pennington is rehab, with a recovery time of 8-10 weeks meaning he will be fit for pre-season following surgery. He’s under contract at Goodison Park until the summer of 2021 but will return to find himself well down the defensive pecking order at a club he joined as an 11-year-old. His displays for Ipswich caught the attention of Derby, with the Rams attempting to lure him to Pride Park at the end of the January transfer window and expected to reignite their interest this summer. Pennington has proven he has what it takes to perform at Championship level and, at the age of 24 and with five loans behind him, now is surely the time for him to find a permanent home where he can truly build his career.<|im_end|>

# Pros of podcasting - The Sunday Guardian Live

Think of a random subject and it’s likely that there is a podcast about it in some corner of the World Wide Web. Over the last few years, Indian podcasters too have raised their game, catering to interests both mainstream and niche. Bhumika Popli writes about how an audio distribution format from the early Noughties is taking over the Internet.    We live in an age dominated by the moving image. Films, TV programmes and the massive assembly line of online videos have transformed not only the way we consume information, but also the way we think. In such a visually-saturated context, how do we make sense of the burgeoning trend of podcasting?  There’s nothing recent about this phenomenon. Users have been uploading and downloading digital audio clips on the World Wide Web for more than a decade now. The term “podcasting” itself goes back to the year 2005. It was coined by the journalist Ben Hammersley as a portmanteau combining “broadcasting” and “iPod”. He, of course, had no idea that his ad-hoc coinage would become this big. Nor could anyone have guessed at the time that in the year 2019, we would still be talking about podcasting.  There has never been a better time to be a podcaster in India. Today, one can access independently-produced online audio programmes made by Indian podcasters on subjects ranging from music, travel and games, to social and political issues.  Suno India, a podcast founded by Padma Priya, Rakesh Kamal and Tarun Nirwan, takes up a different subject every season. The show brings to the fore matters which concern our society but are not talked about on popular forums. Their first series, Dear Pari, from September 2018, included 10 episodes on the subject of adoption.  “There is little scope of actually listening to people and understanding their views, especially on certain topics, on Indian television,” says Padma Priya. “Often, what we see is too much screaming happening on panel discussions. Even the videos on social media do not do justice to such topics due to their duration. Along with all this, there is an information overload on people, thanks to the numerous apps we download on our mobiles. We observed that people wanted to slow down in their consumption of information. Hence, we decided to create something which would provide in-depth analyses of different subjects.”  Among the country’s most popular podcasts, Maed In India is run by Mae Mariyam Thomas, a former radio jockey. Its focus is music, in particular independent music by Indian bands and artistes. The show combines the interview format with in-studio live performances by guests.  Thomas started Maed In India in April 2015 and, in 2018, it was included by Apple iTunes in its list of India’s best podcasts. Podcasting, for Thomas, is about creative freedom. She says, “Unlike radio in India which is restrictive and not open to taking risks with regards to audio ideas, podcasting allows you to explore new formats and shows. You are not limited to ‘appealing to the masses’. The whole point of the rise of digital is to be able to cater to niche audiences and build communities around common interests. Which is why you have the ability to make podcasts about public policy, comic books, mental health, the LGBTQ community etc.”  Bijay Gautam always wanted to decode the thought processes of highly successful people in the world. And so, he began The Inspiring Talk, a podcast featuring the life stories of high-achieving individuals. Gautam also produces another show named Podcast Unfiltered, in which he speaks to fellow podcasters about the nitty-gritty of creating and producing podcasts, touching upon technical as well as financial aspects of this work.  “There are very few people who make money directly from their podcasts in India,” Gautam tells Guardian 20. “One needs to have a considerable number of listeners before one reaches out to an advertiser. However, podcasters can sell their products and services directly on their shows, and I do the same. I help people with launching their own podcasts. But most people are exploring this genre for the love of the game. For them, podcasting is a hobby.”  But is there a secret to succeeding at this hobby? Shrishendu Banerjee runs Biker Radio Rodcast, with his friend Arvinder Singh. The podcast, as is clear by its name, focuses on the biking community in India. It was also a runner-up last year at the Whicker’s Radio & Audio Funding Award held in London.  “What we are doing is very different from a regular podcast,” Banerjee says. “We are creating content around a community. And India’s biking community is quite a close-knit one.”  There are plenty of challenges that such a podcast might face. Finding a sponsor being one of them. What keeps Banerjee’s project afloat is his, and his co-creator’s, passion. As well as their belief that in podcasting, finding your niche is very important. As he says, “Being niche is the key to a successful podcast.”  But Amit Doshi, founder of IVM, a prominent podcasting distribution network in India, disagrees with this Banerjee’s view. He says, “I don’t think that only niche shows work. I think niche shows are one way of creating podcasts where you know your target audience. But the larger opportunities in podcasting in India are in talk-format shows. What we are looking at is the podcast space becoming a de-facto talk radio platform, addressing a variety of subjects.”  Niche or otherwise, the market for podcasts is surely growing in India. Since there are only a handful of radio channels here—which work under strict restrictions—Indian podcasters are operating in an area left untapped for years. There was a clear lack of quality audio content on the airwaves, and today’s hit podcasts seem to be compensating for that.  Also, the recent slashing of mobile data prices in the country has helped Internet creators of all stripes, including podcasters. According to a 2018 report by Voxnest, a research organisation focused on podcasts, there was a 30% growth in the number of podcasts created in India from January to November 2018—the highest growth rate globally.  Bangalore-based Saif Omar and his wife, Faiza Khan, is the couple behind The Musafir Stories, a travel-themed podcast. Omar also writes for a podcast newsletter called Podtalk. According to him, India’s audio ecosystem is definitely growing. “People have started funding their own shows,” he says. “After the hugely popular Serial [an American investigative journalism podcast], people here have started taking this medium quite seriously. Audible and Spotify got into India, and Hubhopper, a purely home-grown network, is helping a lot.”  Hubhopper’s founder, Gautam Raj Anand, shares with us his plans to support the podcasting community in India. “On the distribution side, we are working with various technological devices to spread the word. And on the creative front, we made a platform called Hubhopper Studio. Early on, we realised that while many people here intend to create interesting shows, they don›t necessarily know how to go about it. Hubhopper Studio gives them free hosting, an avenue to upload multiple podcasts, create an RSS feed. It brings them the analytics of their respective shows and exposes them to the best methodologies of recording.”  In his opinion, one can make the audio space in India grow further if we stop thinking of “podcasting” as a limited Internet-generation concept, and re-associate it with the wider segment of audio content. “We have been consuming audio content from the past 70 years, especially through radio. I believe the word podcast isolates people by making the activity sound very niche.”<|im_end|>

# Fox & Friends Idiot: Notre Dame Fire Was Bad, Yes, But Ratings Good

The Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris burned for 12 hours yesterday before some 400 firefighters were able to put out the blaze. French billionaires and companies have already pledged millions to the church’s recovery. But what about the people covering news of the fire, ehh?? Ain’t this story doing GANGBUSTER ratings for us?!! Leave it to Fox & Friends idiot Brian Kilmeade to make it about the real heroes of this fire, not the preservers of history and fighters of fire, but us—the news people who are tellin’ you all about it! “It’s just amazing when you have one thing happen in one famous city and the whole world watches and has a stake in it,” Kilmeade said on the show today. “And probably, I imagine, the ratings around the world went through the roof because everyone was talking about it.” What a Trumpy thing to say about a massive fire that injured at least one firefighter and, besides having so far been nonlethal, was a devastating blow to Paris and people around the world who care about history. But can you even imagine the ratings! They must have been amazing! Of course, what else could we have expected from the network that put this guy on the air.<|im_end|>

# MNS demands CBFC chief Prasoon Joshi's resignation for allegedly favouring PM Narendra Modi biopic- Entertainment News, Firstpost

MNS demands CBFC chief Prasoon Joshi's resignation for allegedly favouring PM Narendra Modi biopic  The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena(MNS) has demanded the resignation of Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) chairman Prasoon Joshi over allegedly giving preferential treatment to the makers of the upcoming biopic on Narendra Modi.  "As per the rule, the producers have to submit the final copy of the film 58 days before the film’s release date. Why was special treatment given to the biopic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi? We condemn the Censor Board which went out of its way only for this film in order to appease the government. Prasoon Joshi should immediately resign from his post for his actions", said Ameya Khopkar, president, MNS film wing, reports The Hindu.  On 4 April, the makers of PM Narendra Modi announced on social media that they had postponed the release date of the movie, while the CBFC said the film was still undergoing due process of examination and certification.  The film, titled PM Narendra Modi and directed by Omung Kumar, has been criticised by the Opposition parties, who claim that the biopic could give undue advantage to the BJP in the polls as it will arrive in theatres before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The seven-phase polls will begin on 11 April, the day the film is scheduled to release.  Vivek Oberoi opened up in an interview with Asian News International and said: "We wanted to release the film on 5 April but some people put us in so many difficulties that we couldn't do it. We are working hard to get the film released on 11 April, we have to go to the Supreme Court on Monday."

# Shepherd student wins scholarship to workshop with poet Michael Collier

SHEPHERDSTOWN -- Shepherd University student Lilli Sutton, an English major from Boonsboro, Maryland, earned a scholarship to a poetry workshop by winning a poetry contest conducted by the Department of English and Modern Languages. Sutton won the opportunity to participate in a workshop taught by Maryland poet laureate Michael Collier that took place on Feb. 9 as part of the inaugural event for the Society for Creative Writing. Sutton's poems focus on human relationships, the self and the natural environment. Her work has previously been published in Shepherd's literary magazine Sans Merci and The Albion Review. The second place winner was Ally Wharton, a history major from Charles Town, who serves as the student representative for Shepherd's Appalachian Studies Board and will be the next student editor of the Anthology of Appalachian Writers. Her poetry has appeared in Cheap Pop, Maudlin House, Five2One Journal and Philosophical Idiot. Fiona Tracey, an English major from Shepherdstown, won third place. Tracey also works as an editor and contributor for Sans Merci. The poetry of all three students will be displayed in the Shepherdstown Town Hall as part of the Poem of the Month program, and will be included in a collection that will be published in the future.

# Clippers Waive Luc Mbah a Moute | SLAM

The Los Angeles Clippers have waived injured forward Luc Mbah a Moute, Marc Stein of The New York Times reports. The veteran played in just four games for the team this season, all in October.  The 32-year-old was scheduled to miss eight weeks of action as recently as late March when it was revealed that he’d be undergoing surgery to repair a tear in his left knee.  Although the move won’t offer any financial relief for the Clippers, it will open up a roster spot that the playoff-bound team may want to fill with a body that can provide depth during the forthcoming postseason.  Sure, Mbah a Moute didn’t leave much of a mark in 2018-19 but that doesn’t mean that his absence wasn’t still felt. The Clips signed the familiar face to a $4 million deal last summer after relying on him heavily as a starter during a previous stint between 2015 and 2017.  The Clippers will have until the end of the regular season on Wednesday to sign an additional player to their roster. They could convert a player on a two-way deal in order to make them playoff eligible, particularly Johnathan Motley who has played 21 games for the big league club, or pursue an external hire.<|im_end|>

# Gloria Hunniford says dead daughter leaves her white feather angel calling cards

Gloria Hunniford believes her late daughter Caron Keating leaves white feathers for her as “calling cards”.  Loose Women star Gloria, 79, has described losing a child as “the worst thing that can happen to you in your life”.  Gloria, from Portadown, Northern Ireland, said losing Caron to breast cancer at the age of 41 in 2004, was the lowest point in her life.  But she also opened up about how Caron, who presented Blue Peter, believed in angels and thought that a single white feather was an angel’s calling card.  Gloria said: “She totally believed that if she found an isolated white feather, it was a sign of an angel’s calling card.  “Now, when I find that white feather, I’d like to believe that it’s Caron’s calling card.”  The mum of three added: “She used to make me laugh, because if she couldn’t get parked she’d say, ‘I’ll just ask the parking angel’.”  Gloria, grandmother to Caron’s two sons with manager Russ Lindsay, added: “To lose a child is categorically the worst thing that can happen to you in your life.  “’That’s a low point that you never think you are going to be in and it is very hard to get out of it.  “I’ve lost parents, my former husband Don Keating, colleagues and friends, but losing a child is just one of the most horrific things that can happen to you.  “You’ve carried that child for nine months, given birth to that child, loved that child to maximum capacity.  “To then lose that child, at whatever age, is utterly devastating.”  She added: “You are in such deep grief, it’s hard to take on the grief of people around you – it’s a very selfish grief for a while.  “I woke one day and I thought, I have a lovely husband and children and grandchildren and I have to get myself back to some sort of normality for them.”<|im_end|>

# Study: Cannabis users need nearly double the anesthesia for medical procedures

If you use cannabis, you might want to let your doctor know before having procedures needing anesthesia.  An eye-opening study shows people who reported smoking or using edibles on a daily or weekly basis needed as much as two times the level of sedation as non-users.  Researchers in Grand Junction, Colorado looked at 250 patients who required endoscopic procedures. They found patients who regularly used cannabis needed 14 percent more fentanyl, 20 percent more midazolam and 220 percent more propofol for sedation.  A professor of anesthesia at the University of Pennsylvania considers the study a good starting point, but said that it needs a complete trial.

# American rock ‘n’ roll lives on through J3 Vocal Showband

Fresh off their Southwest Florida holiday tour in December, the family-fronted J3 Vocal Showband are getting back on the road playing what they do best: good ol’ rock ‘n’ roll. J3 will make the ‘oldies’ feel new again, performing songs from the ‘50s through the ‘80s, at the William H. Wakeman, III Cultural Center Theater in Port Charlotte on April 20. Family members Dennis, Bonnie and Chad Johns rock the ages performing songs from artists such as Ben E. King, Tanya Tucker, Elvis Presley, Billy Joel, Dixie Cups, Beach Boys, Stevie Nicks, Chuck Berry, Roy Orbison, The Coasters, Roy Hamilton and many more. “Our song choices are songs we like of course,” said Dennis, “but we always consider our audience and choose songs that folks want to hear. We have been performing as this group for four years now. In that time, we have had many sold out shows.” Complete with costume changes, choreography and even a little comedy, no two shows are the same with the J3 Vocal Showband. “It never gets old,” said Chad. “It just doesn’t get any better than this; singing with my family has always been what I wanted to do more than anything.” Fans come back time and time again to twist away with the group’s upbeat songs and personality. J3 delivers an exciting, moving and memorable experience, while keeping true to each song’s original impact. “Apparently, we are hitting on things people enjoy,” said Dennis, “... we see laughter, smiles and, on some songs, folks even shed a tear.” The family’s master harmonies are not to be denied. Despite a hiatus from touring in the southern gospel industry for over 15 years, the trio launched the eight-piece group and regenerate the old-school sounds of rock n’ roll’s golden era. “We do change our show each (new year),” said Dennis. “We keep songs people respond highly to and add songs as well so not to be the same each time in case of repeat fans. We have been blessed with hundreds of people coming to our shows three or four times (over). We are highly honored to share that with them.” The band’s members work hard to present a show worthy of each unique audience, according to Dennis. “For the patrons that are spending their hard earned money to come to our shows,” said Dennis, “what an honor we all have to be sharing and performing some of America’s greatest rock ‘n’ roll songs. We promise you will have an exciting, fun, moving and memorable experience at each of our shows.” J3 Vocal Showband will take the stage for the last show of the season at The William H. Wakeman, III Cultural Center Theater located at 2280 Aaron St., Port Charlotte. Tickets range from $20-$39. For tickets or more information visit www.sunevents.com or contact the box office at 941-625-4172 Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Doors open at 6 p.m. The show starts at 7 p.m.<|im_end|>

# Dairy bull calf crisis: Will sexed semen be the answer?

Dairy bull calf crisis: Will sexed semen be the answer?  As this year’s dairy bull calf crisis starts to wind down, dairy farmers begin their search for answers to the problem for spring 2020. One option that has been discussed and dismissed more often than not is that of sexed semen. However, sexed semen has yet to make any lasting impressions amongst farmers. Speaking at a recent breeding information meeting, Seamus Hughes – a Progressive Genetics dairy breeding advisor – outlined some of his concerns regarding the future of sexed semen for the dairy industry. He said: “The biggest sexed semen trial was done in 2013 and the results were average-to-poor. “There was another trial done only last spring on what was to be a different product, but I’ve always had my doubts about this.The people who control the sexed semen and technology worldwide are difficult people to deal with and I don’t mind saying it.  The long of the short is that the results of last year’s trials were marginally worse than the trials in 2013. “There is a theory out there now and it is being tested this spring by Stephen Butler in Teagasc, which is based around the timing of AI and we’ll see what happens. “But at the moment, sexed semen is about 74%. So, if your normal conventional semen is at 100% – as a benchmark – sexed semen is at about 74% of that. In my mind it is not there at all yet.” Finally, he concluded by saying: “Conception rates are hugely herd dependent in the sense that it is all over the place – in terms of farmers getting on reasonably well and farmers having a complete disaster.”<|im_end|>

# Brexit blamed as 'worst worker shortage' sees daffodils left to rot in fields

A chronic shortage of agricultural workers from Eastern Europe has saw daffodils left to rot in fields.  Farmers are blaming Brexit on the worst shortage of workers they have ever seen for the growing season which runs from January to April.  The current political crisis and a plunging pound mean seasonal pickers from Romania and Bulgaria are not coming to the UK and the agricultural sector cannon attract British workers to do the job.  Brothers Jeremy and James Hosking told Cornwall Live they have rows of daffodils wilting on their farm in Truro.  James, 58, said: “The devaluation of the pound means when the pickers’ transfer and convert wages into the local currency they earn less than they used to and less than they can in other European countries.  "Historically we have got migrant workers from Lithuania and Latvia but their economies are a lot stronger so this season we have got them from mostly Bulgaria and Romania.  James claimed locals did not want to work in the fields, saying he only had ten applications this year. Of those, eight were offered jobs but only two turned up and they did not last their first week.  He added: “The government has announced they will allow 2,500 but for edible crops only. Even if we were allowed to use all of them to pick daffodils that would allow for only a quarter of the Cornish crop. So what does everyone else do and what does the rest of the country do?  "The government has forgotten how much we need the unskilled migrant sector which is vital for most economies.  "People can cope without flowers but I can guarantee they will notice when there is no vegetables on sale in their supermarkets."  The lack of manpower has been described as a devastating blow for the daffodil picking industry which generates around £45m a year for the UK economy. Britain is by far the world’s largest producer of daffodils, with about 75 per cent grown in Cornwall.<|im_end|>

# 'Messi always appears' - Valverde salutes Barcelona star after Man Utd double | Goal.com

Messi scored a first-half brace and Philippe Coutinho added Barca's third in a 3-0 win over United at Camp Nou on Tuesday, a result that sealed a 4-0 aggregate success.  Valverde was predictably delighted with Messi, who is up to 45 goals in all competitions this season.  "Messi always appears," he told Movistar. "Not only in moments, but in the games as a whole.  "He scores but is also the offensive weight of our team."  Barca will enter the semi-finals as one of the favourites to win the Champions League for what would be their sixth title.  However, head coach Valverde played down favouritism and said his side's next focus was on reaching the final at the Wanda Metropolitano on June 1.  "We have done two good games. That is what you have to do to be able to continue in the Champions League and that you consider us more or less favourites," he said.  "We are well. We are confident for the next tie against a great rival and for that we have 10 or 15 days left. We would like to reach the final."<|im_end|>

# Biotechnology Industry Wants to Diversify Leadership

Understanding that diversity is good for the bottom line, The Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) announced on April 16 that it’s taking action on trying to increase gender, racial, ethnic and LGBTQ representation on biotech company boards, in C-suites and in functional leadership positions.  Recent studies, including 2018 Why Diversity Matters report conducted by McKinsey & Company, companies in the top 25% for gender diversity and top 35% for racial diversity are more likely to have higher financial returns than less diverse companies.  To ensure its member companies are seeing those types of returns, the organization, which the world's largest trade association representing biotechnology companies, academic institutions, state biotechnology centers across 30 nations, created a “Right Mix Matters” campaign.  Associated with this campaign are two new solutions:  The new BIO Boardlist is an online portal of curated talent that connects highly qualified diverse leaders with opportunities to serve on private and public company boards. The BIO Diversity & Inclusion Toolkit is a set of practical tools for developing programs, procedures and best practices to build a diverse workforce. “Our industry is stronger than ever before and there is a collective sense of excitement about the future of biotechnology,” said Helen Torley, CEO of Halozyme and Chair of BIO’s board-level Workforce Development, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee.  “Continued progress requires an unprecedented level of innovation and problem solving—and this is best achieved by tapping into multiple and diverse perspectives and experiences. The new tools address specific barriers biotech leaders tell us they face today in building diverse and inclusive teams and boards and will, I believe, lead to improved development and increased visibility of talented, diverse leaders.”  The BIO Boardlist database provides detailed profiles of talented, board-eligible, diverse individuals with extensive experience in the biotech industry. CEOs and/or board members can nominate board-ready diverse candidates for the BIO Boardlist. Once vetted and approved, candidates become part of the BIO Boardlist and can be discovered by CEOs and board members through a search feature.  All leaders, employees and human resources departments of biotech companies around the country will have access to proven tools through the D&I Toolkit which can assist with identifying and developing diverse talent. This includes the top resources from successful programs from member companies.<|im_end|>

# Gritty Seattle Seahawks Outlast Green Bay Packers 28-22, Advance to Super Bowl

With 3:52 left to go in the game, the defending champion Seattle Seahawks were nearly down for the count in their NFC Championship game against the Green Bay Packers. Nearly down for the count.  After punting the ball away, Green Bay was leading the game 19-7, set to lean on their stout defense to close things out. Their prospects looked good: to that point, the Packers had generated 258 yards of total offense to just 192 for Seattle, were winning the first down battle 16-12, and although not playing a mistake-costless game, were still +3 in the turnover department. The odds were looking exceedingly favorable for a trip to the Super Bowl, the franchise's first since 2010.  "We just weren't making the plays for whatever reason," said quarterback Russell Wilson, who was 14-29 for 209 yards, one touchdown and four interceptions. "Having four turnovers by me, that's tough."  And yet, football is a 60 minutes game, and in their final two drives, Wilson and his Seahawks displayed true championship mettle. Seattle scored two late touchdowns and converted a 'Hail Mary' two-point play to ultimately forge a regulation tie, then won the game in stunning fashion as the crowd of 68,538 thundered their approval.  "I've seen a lot of sports," continued Wilson. "I think the resilience of our team is unmatchable."  Green Bay Started Conservatively  After the first of a career high four Wilson interceptions courtesy of a pass which glanced off Jermaine Kearse's hands and into the arms of safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, the Packers drove from the Seattle 19 down to the one yard line. On fourth down, Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy opted for the sure points and kicker Mason Crosby delivered, splitting the uprights for the early 3-0 lead.  On the ensuing kickoff, Doug Baldwin fumbled, putting the Packers back in business at the Seattle 23. As with the previous drive, Green Bay marched down to the one yard line, and yet again, McCarthy did not attempt to punch it in on fourth down, settling for the field goal and 6-0 advantage.  "I just felt that you had to take points," explained McCarthy after the game. "I didn’t think a lot of points would win this game. I didn’t think it was going to take a lot of points to win this game. Today that was my thinking coming in. I felt great about our defense all week just the way they’d been building here in the last, eight, nine weeks. So that’s why we had to take the field goals."  The Packers Extended the Lead  The momentum remained firmly on the side of the Packers. After a three-and-out by Seattle, Green Bay capped a seven play, 56-yard drive with a 13-yard connection between Aaron Rodgers (19-34, 178, 1 TD, 2 interceptions) and Randall Cobb, extending the lead to 13-0.  The first quarter ended with the Packers having outgained the Seahawks, 147-3.  Green Bay Led 16-0 at the Half  The second quarter saw two more interceptions thrown by Wilson, along with an Aaron Rogers pick — a critical one, as it turned out, given that it cost the Packers at least three points.  After the wild first quarter, the only points in the second were another Crosby field goal, his third of the game. At halftime, Green Bay was in complete control of the game, leading 16-0.  "They jumped on us and tore us up in the first quarter," said Seattle head coach Pete Carroll. "We just made mistake after mistake and looked terrible. But the defense played phenomenal sudden-change football to make those field goals happen."  Seattle Closed to Within Nine Points  The Seahawks have shown second-half resilience all season long, and on the big stage of the NFC Championship game, things were no different. After having been badly outplayed in the first half, the Seahawks gained 87 yards in the third quarter to just 26 for Green Bay and scored their first touchdown, closing the gap to 16-7.  The touchdown was uncharacteristic of the meat-and-potatoes Seattle offense, which typically grinds yardage in a methodical fashion. After an eleven play, 78-yard drive stalled at the Packers 19, the Seahawks pulled off a perfect fake field goal, with holder Jon Ryan pulling the ball up, running to his left, and lofting a touchdown pass to tackle-eligible Clint Gresham. "What a fantastic play," said Carroll. "Going to his left and to find Clint Gresham for the touchdown. Who'd have thunk it?"  Lightning Struck in the Fourth Quarter  After a Mason Crosby field goal increased the Green Bay lead to 19-7, the situation was looking bleak for the Seahawks. However, Seattle got back into the game, marching 69 yards in just 1:39 and scoring on a four-yard Wilson keeper with 2:13 remaining. The drive was highlighted by a Wilson-to-Lynch pass that was initially ruled a touchdown, but reversed on replay after the officials indicated he stepped out at the nine yard line.  Following the touchdown, Seattle lined up for the onside kick. Kicker Steven Hauschka executed the play perfectly, the ball bounding high into the air. Green Bay tight end Brandon Bostick, a member of the 'hands' team, inadvertently had the ball slip through his hands and deflect off his helmet, which was subsequently corralled by Seahawks receiver Chris Matthews.  A despondent Bostick said after the game, ""I let my team down, I feel like. There was a lot on this game. I just feel like if I was able to do my job -- my assignment was to block. Jordy [Nelson] would've caught the ball and the game would've been over."  Following the recovery, the Seahawks scored the go-ahead touchdown four plays later. Taking the handoff at the Green Bay 24, Marshawn Lynch rumbled off left tackle, waltzing untouched into the end zone with 1:33 left in the game.  On the two-point conversion try, Wilson backpedaled from a furious Packers rush and at the last second, threw a high-arcing floater toward the end zone. Luke Willson managed to come down with the ball, putting Seattle up 22-19.  "A lot of teams would have given up," said linebacker Bruce Irvin. "We kept fighting—we kept fighting and believing. The motto of our program is finishing, and that’s what we did.”  The Pack Struck Back  In the NFL, 1:33 is practically an eternity, and with an MVP-caliber quarterback like Aaron Rodgers, more than enough time to drive for a game-tying score.  Methodically slicing through a Seattle prevent defense, Rodgers engineered a seven play, 48-yard drive, stopping at the Seahawks 30. Crosby came in with just 19 seconds left and kicked his fifth field goal, tying a championship game record. As regulation expired, the game was tied 22-22.  The Seahawks Punched Their Tickets to the Super Bowl  After winning the coin toss and electing to receive the kick, Seattle displayed a quick-strike offense that caught the Packers on their heels.  On third and seven from their own 30, Wilson tossed a perfect pass to a streaking Doug Baldwin, who gained 35 yards to the Green Bay 35. On the very next play, Wilson threw the ball over the middle on a go-route to Jermaine Kearse, who snagged it in the face of tight coverage and fell into the end zone for the game winning score. The crowd went absolutely bonkers in celebration of the improbable Seattle comeback victory.  "(Kearse) was very emotional after the game because he knew he was in the midst of a lot of things that didn’t go right for us today," said Carroll. "What a great story, you know, local kid and all of that, wins the game with that touchdown catch. He was totally emotional about it, because he felt like he had not been able to come through in some other situations. But that is exactly the Jermaine Kearse that I was talking about. He just finds a way to do stuff for us, another touchdown in a playoff game in a critical situation, and wins the game. It was just extraordinary."  Notes  Seattle's 16-point comeback was the largest halftime deficit overcome in championship game history.  Despite suffering significant injuries during the game, Seattle's Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas professed their intentions to play in the Super Bowl. Thomas is scheduled for an MRI on Monday.  Marshawn Lynch gained 157 yards on 25 carries, handily winning the tailback battle with Eddie Lacy (21 carries, 73 yards).  Doug Baldwin had six catches for 106 yards. Jordy Nelson led the Packers with 71 yards on five receptions.  Both quarterbacks had subpar games. Wilson, who entered the contest as the highest-rated postseason quarterback in NFL history, had a QBR of just 44.3. Rodgers wasn't much better, with a QBR of 55.8.  The Seahawks play the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX on February 1st. They will be attempting to become the first franchise since the Patriots of 2003 and 2004 to win back-to-back Super Bowls.<|im_end|>

# Tennis: Nadal steamrolls to opening Monte Carlo win

MONTE CARLO, Principality of Monaco (AFP) - Rafael Nadal charged out of the blocks on Wednesday (April 17) to hammer Roberto Bautista Agut 6-1, 6-1 in his opening match at the Monte Carlo Masters.  The 11-time champion showed no sign of the knee problems which forced him to quit ahead of an Indian Wells semi-final against Roger Federer a month ago.  The 32-year-old had expressed pre-tournament caution regarding the health of his knee - a worry which appeared to be groundless after a 76-minute masterclass.  "I'm happy for this very positive start. I had good feelings on court," he said.  Nadal collected the opening five games of the afternoon in 17 minutes as he set the tone for another dominant display in the principality.  He was equally in control during the second set, where he saved three break points in the fourth game and two more in the sixth.  "It was a great start, it's good to be back here," the 17-time Grand Slam winner said, keeping talk of his knee to a minimum.  "I can't pretend to not have pain at all, but professionals normally play with pain," Nadal said.  "It's part of the sport at the highest level and it's no limitations at all. I was able to move well and be confident with the things that I did."  Bautista Agut has now lost to his Spanish countryman in all three of their meetings, while Nadal improved his incredible record here to 69-4 as he takes aim at a fourth consecutive title at the event.  "This is just the first match and it's been a very positive start," Nadal said. "The results say that."  Roland Garros finalist Dominic Thiem, who lost to Nadal in Paris last June, beat Slovakia's Martin Klizan 6-1, 6-4.  Thiem, who won the Indian Wells title over Federer, made a successful switch to his favourite surface as he prepares for the pre-French Open sequence of events.  Fourth seed Thiem won with a break in the final game after Klizan held a 40-0 lead.  UPBEAT ZVEREV  Alexander Zverev rediscovered traces of his best form with a 6-1, 6-4 defeat of Canadian teenager Felix Auger-Aliassime.  The German, locally based, reached the third round as he tamed the 18-year-old who broke through for a Miami semi-final last month.  The 21-year-old Zverev played the semi-finals in Monte Carlo a year ago but has yet to hit his stride this season.  That may be starting to change.  "This is the first time this season I've felt really healthy," said Zverev, who lost prematurely at both Indian Wells and Miami, as well as in Marrakech last week.  "I've been training well but haven't been able to take that into matches.  "I live just 500m from here, I'm comfortable on this court. I'm starting to feel better about my game.  "I'm really ready for the clay season."  Zverev swept the opening set in 30 minutes but had to get through a series of three straight breaks of serve between him and his opponent before finally advancing in 78 minutes.  The third seed will next face Italy's Fabio Fognini, who reached the third round when French opponent Gilles Simon withdrew because of back problems.  Greek sixth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas moved ahead, defeating Mikhail Kukushkin 6-3, 7-5.  "I need to maintain my focus, my concentration, my aggressive mindset when I'm on the court," Tsitsipas said.  "If all these are combined, then I have nothing to fear and I have nothing to be afraid of when I'm on the court.  "This is the first big clay court tournament, not everyone is very well prepared for that. It's been a long hardcourt court season before the clay."  Britain's Cameron Norrie defeated Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (7/3), 6-3, while Pierre-Hugues Herbert stunned 2018 finalist and fifth seed Kei Nishikori 7-5, 6-4.<|im_end|>

# "I would classify it as federally funded drug dealing": Dozens arrested in massive opioid bust

Just after sunrise in Cookeville, Tennessee, federal, state and local agents prepared for the largest opioid takedown of medical providers in the country. Dozens of people were arrested in seven states after prescribing 32 million pills. "If you overprescribe, if you steal from a taxpayer, you're going to go to jail," said Special Agent Derrick Jackson. Wednesday's operation stretched across states among the hardest hit in the opioid crisis. In all, they indicted 60 individuals including doctors, nurses and pharmacists. In one case, a Tennessee doctor known as "the rock doc" who piloted a reality TV show about his clinic, allegedly prescribed dangerous combinations of opioids in exchange for sexual favors. Agent Jackson drove CBS News through Clay County, and Cookeville, a small town with fewer than 8,000 residents. But it's also home to three pharmacies on the same block. Two of them prescribed more than 1 and a half million opioid pills. Dozens indicted Wednesday are also charged with billing Medicare and Medicaid for unnecessary prescriptions. "I would classify it as federally funded drug dealing yes, because these are federal programs that are paying for the drugs," Jackson said. The pharmacists who worked at those pharmacies was among those indicted. Agents said over three years, one pharmacy prescribed enough opioids per day for every man woman and child in Clay County.<|im_end|>

# Former WWE Stars Enzo And Big Cass Tried To ’Invade’ The G1 Supercard

On the same night that a crazy person in a Rasta hat tried to tackle Bret Hart during the WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony, another big New York WrestleMania weekend show was being “invaded” … this time by former WWE stars Enzo Amore and Big Cass, apparently vying for the title of saddest fall from grace.  The “invasion” happened at the end of the PCO and Brody King vs. The Guerrillas of Destiny vs. The Briscoes vs. EVIL and SANADA match for both the ROH and IWGP tag team championships. Per fans in attendance, Enzo and Cass threw a beer at the Briscoes from the stands, then jumped the rail and attempted to, for lack of better phrasing, fight the entire match. They threw hands with The Briscoes, which led to the Briscoes and Bully Ray beating them up.  You can watch a few fan-filmed clips below.<|im_end|>

# He sold the dose of fentanyl that killed a man. Now, he will serve up to 20 years in prison.

After a 27-year-old man was found dead in his home from a fentanyl overdose, authorities in Warren County traced the source of the powerful painkiller. A two-and-a-half-month investigation led them to Matthew Evans, of the first block of Woolston Way in Washington Borough -- a 10-minute drive from the Green Street home in Washington Township where his buyer’s body was found early the morning of Feb. 2, 2018.  On Monday, almost a year after his arrest, Evans, now 40, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, the county prosecutor’s office announced. His conviction in January may have been the county’s first on the charge of strict liability for a drug-induced death, said Victor Jusino, who prosecuted the case. In January, the prosecutor’s office had said Evans could face up to life in prison under a New Jersey law allowing the court to impose an expanded sentence. But on Thursday, it appeared Judge Robert Reed adhered to the 20-year maximum sentence that is typical for that type of charge. Evans was also sentenced to five years each on three additional drug distribution and possession charges, but those sentences will run simultaneously with the 20-year one. Evans will have to serve at least 17 years, followed by five years of parole after his release, Jusino said. When Evans was arrested, investigators at the time said the charges "should send a clear message" to dealers. “If you sell drugs to someone and they die as a result of taking those drugs, you can and will be charged with the death,” they said. “Let’s hope they get the message.”<|im_end|>

# Novartis case findings sent to Parliament – Indications arise for one of the accused

The findings of the prosecutorial investigation of the Novartis case found “indications” of bribery against MP Andreas Loverdos. 
The lead Prosecutor in the case, Eleni Touloupakis sent the findings of the report to the Council of State (CoS) via the Ministry of Justice with a request for the lifting of Mr Loverdos’s immunity. The Greek politician is the only to be charged, as all the others implicated in the case were exonerated.  Responding to the news, Mr Loverdos issued a statement expressing his outrage. The announcement reads as follows: “When this terrible and troublesome plot came to the surface, I had characterised the natural and moral perpetrators as despicable and disgusting. After today I will add: they are criminals. And some people are wrong to dub it a farce. Where things have reached, we can only be talking about political chicanery from a group of gangsters”.<|im_end|>

# Andrew Jordan after race-winning start at Brands Hatch: ‘We have a great base to build on going forwards’ - The Checkered Flag

Andrew Jordan emerged out of the opening weekend of BTCC action at Brands Hatch as a race winner once again but this time in a new car for the WSR-ran Pirtek Racing driver.  The team which also includes current BTCC champion Colin Turkington switched to the BMW 330i M Sport for this year; it seems to be reaping it’s rewards with the former champion claiming victory  Despite faltering in the final race he has no complaints about the weekend and sees it as a base going forward into the next race weekend on the calendar.  “We have shown we have some serious speed in the car this weekend and it’s great to get the first win for the 330i M Sport,” he said.  “That was the dream coming into Brands Hatch, although we didn’t know if it was something we could realistically do.  “Race one was one of those where hindsight is a wonderful thing when it comes to the tyres, but at this stage of the year, we had to take the sensible view and go with the majority.  “We managed to salvage a point and to then win from fifteenth in race two was just brilliant.  “We were flattered a little bit by the fact that we were on the right tyres, but the car was really hooked up and performed brilliantly.  “I made up a load of places at the start and then made some good moves into Paddock Hill Bend that allowed me to get the job done, and I’m so happy to get that win.  “Okay so we could have got more from the final race but I can’t complain at a weekend where we have come out with a brand new car and taken victory. We have a great base to build on going forwards.”<|im_end|>

# APSU’s Brown named dean of College of Behavioral and Health Sciences

Dr. Tucker Brown, chair of the APSU Department of Sociology, was recently named dean of the University’s College of Behavioral and Health Sciences. Dr. David Denton, former dean of the college, decided to return to the classroom in 2017, leaving the position open. Dr. Rebecca Corvey, professor of nursing, served as interim dean while the University conducted a national search to fill the position. Brown arrived at Austin Peay in 2007 as assistant professor of sociology and coordinator of the program’s Family Studies minor. In 2013, he was named chair of that department. During his time at Austin Peay, Brown has taken on several leadership roles, including president of the APSU Faculty Senate, chair of the Faculty Development Planning Committee, co-chair of the Quality Enhancement Plan’s Grant Review Committee and the president’s faculty appointee to the APSU Academic Council. “I’ve worked with Dr. Tucker Brown for several years, and in that time I’ve been impressed by his leadership and his commitment to the University,” Dr. Rex Gandy, APSU provost and vice president for academic affairs, said. “He is highly regarded among the faculty, staff and students, and I know he’ll continue to move the College of Behavioral and Health Sciences forward.” Brown is a well-regarded academic, having published several scholarly articles and delivered more than 17 conference presentations. In recent years, his focus has shifted to improving the University experience for students through grant-funded research. He, along with several APSU colleagues, received a $144,407 Tennessee Higher Education Commission grant for “improving campus climate for increased degree attainment” at Austin Peay. He also collaborated with faculty from the Department of Political Science on a $110,000 Tennessee Board of Regents Access and Diversity Grant. That grant targeted nontraditional military spouses and provided participants with stipends for child care and books in exchange for completing leadership and service-learning coursework and projects. Brown earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Penn State. He received a Master of Science and his Ph.D. in sociology from Arizona State University.<|im_end|>

# Malawi: Chief Admits Discriminating People Based On HIV Status

File photo  Salima, April 17, 2019. Group Village Headman (GVH) Jiamusi, from Traditional Authority (TA) Pemba has admitted that for a long time he has been sidelining and denying his subjects to access social support programmes if they declare to be HIV.  The Chief made the revelation to Malawi News Agency (MANA) on Tuesday on the sidelines of an interface meeting between duty bearers and citizenry, which was organized by human rights campaigners under the banner of Our Bodies, Our life which comprise of Coalition of Women Living with HIV, Cowhla and Manerera+.  In his confession, the Chief said that because of ignorance, he snatched a piece of land from Agnes Hussein, 40 year old mother of five, because she had declared her status.  "It was out of ignorance that when I learnt that she had declared that she was found with the HIV virus I presume that she was weak and could not use the land for growing crops, I decided to give the land to my relations who I assume had strength to utilize the land," he admitted.  The Chief said that he thought HIV positive people do not deserve land or to benefit from social protection projects such as MASAF 4, and Public Works.  In another interview, Hussein said she tested HIV positive in 2009 and in 2016 her health deteriorated and it was at that period when the GVH snatched her piece of land.  "When my health deteriorated I didn't cultivate my maize field for two seasons and that was the time when the GVH took his action and advised me to stop using the land," she claimed.  Hussein said the action affected her as she depended on the piece of land to grow food crops.  "We are peasant farmers and land is a critical thing, so when I lost that land it was like my life was taken, I could not produce my own food even when my health started to stabilize," she said.  Hussein said that apart from snatching her land the chief through the development structure of the Village Development Committee (VDC) have continuously avoided including her in social support programs such as the just ended distribution of free maize to families facing food shortages.  Chair of the VDC, Jawadu Chimbalanga confessed that as Chairperson their structure was of the view that poor people who are affected by HIV did not deserve to participate in social support programs.  "It is true we have not being selecting her to benefit because we used to feel that she is not fit to do the work," he said.  Senior Nutrition and HIV Officer, Lucious Njovu said that his office is enable to trace signs of stigma and discrimination which need to be reduced within government development programmes.  "We cannot do much apart from advising the chiefs and their structures to stop sideling the affected people, but the rest is a human rights matter which can be best dealt by Human Rights bodies," he pointed out.<|im_end|>

# Avon man charged in suspected case of armed road rage on I-93

State police arrested an Avon man after they say he brandished a handgun at another driver wielding a knife in a case of suspected road rage at the height of this morning’s commute on the Southeast Expressway.  Daniel Bates, 33, was expected to appear in Dorchester District Court today to be arraigned on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace.  Troopers said Braintree police located both motorists on Hancock Street. Troopers reported finding a Sig Sauer P320 9mm handgun in Bates’ possession. They said they also seized a folding knife from the other driver, who was not immediately charged.  Trooper Michael Martin’s preliminary investigation indicates that at about 7:45 a.m., Bates was headed southbound on Interstate 93 prior to Exit 12 in a 2015 Chevrolet pickup when he allegedly became involved in a moving altercation with the 42-year-old driver of a 2007 Honda CRV.  It was during the alleged dispute that police said Bates allegedly brandished a firearm, and the other operator, a Boston man, allegedly brandished a knife as the two continued to travel southbound.  Police said the driver of the Honda called 911 to report the incident “and remained on the line while giving dispatchers updated locations of both vehicles.”<|im_end|>

# Opinion | Get vaccination facts from a doctor, not fake news

As a doctor in our community, I'm increasingly worried about misinformation in the news and on social media about vaccination.  In medical school, doctors are taught to "do no harm," which makes it hard for us to live up to our professional responsibility when we see people choosing not to get vaccinated because of fake news.  The facts are clear — since the introduction of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine there's been a 99 per cent reduction in cases. And since Canada introduced the polio vaccine, the disease has been eradicated. These conditions are debilitating and deadly.  Because childhood vaccinations are proven safe and effective in Ontario, we've forgotten how quickly and easily these diseases can spread and how devastating they can be.  And we all need to get vaccinated if we can, because "herd immunity" matters. Herd immunity is like building a wall to keep illness at bay, and each person who gets vaccinated is another brick in that wall.  If you have concerns, talk to your doctor about vaccines and don't spread fake news or misinformation.  Get the facts from a professional — get the facts from a doctor.

# For Husky linebacker Ariel Ngata, spring practice is a balancing act

Sometimes Ariel Ngata just wants to go home and rest — but he doesn’t.  Instead, the Washington linebacker will head to Husky Stadium to study film. If he goes there to eat, he’ll move upstairs and watch with one of the coaches. Even when he’s working on homework for a few hours, he always sets aside 15 to 20 minute breaks to go over a call or two. Ngata has worked with both the inside and outside linebackers during spring practice, spending two days a week at one position before switching to the other. While the redshirt sophomore described the balancing act as easy, he admitted there is sacrifice that goes along with playing two positions.  Most of that sacrifice is time.  “If I’m in a different room on one day, I’ll miss the install for that other position,” Ngata said after practice on Wednesday. “So it’s really more of finding my own time to watch film, finding the coach and have him explain it to me, taking notes, just everything.  “I’d say that’s the hardest part but that’s just something I got to do. I’ve got to step up and take responsibility and be accountable to make that time.” Ngata was an outside linebacker last season, playing in 12 of the Huskies’ 14 games. He finished the year with 11 tackles, seven solo, and a forced fumble.  Inside linebackers coach Bob Gregory said UW’s outside linebackers tend to have a thicker build, like the 6-foot-5, 266-pound Joe Tryon. Ngata, who is 6-foot-3 and 216 pounds, has the height and pass-rushing ability of an outside linebacker but is on the thinner side. Because of that, the coaches wanted to see what he could do inside.  “He has been doing the extra work,” Gregory said. “It’s not easy playing two positions but I think Ariel has caught on pretty good. He certainly has taken ownership of it.” Gregory and outside linebackers coach Pete Kwiatkowski have made the transition easy, Ngata said. And because he spends equal time at each position, Ngata hasn’t fallen behind. “Some of it is also me just finding extra time to come in and watch film for both of them,” Ngata said, “so I just know them both like the back of my hand.” When considering asking a player to balance two positions, Gregory said the first and biggest concern is whether he can handle it mentally. That’s something Ngata has been able to do.  “And then it’s spring football,” Gregory said. “We’re not playing a game so it’s OK if kids make a mistake and all that. We’re trying different things out and (Ngata’s) been good so far.”  Gregory said Ngata has put in more effort and watched more film this offseason than he has in any other year with the program. Because of that work, Ngata has impressed with how well he’s picked up the second position. “I don’t know if I could overstate it enough: Watching film, that’s our greatest teaching tool, especially a guy like him that’s playing two positions,” Gregory said. “(He’s) watching film on his own, he’ll come in and watch film with me, watch film with Coach (Kwiatkowski). The whole deal.” For Ngata, the biggest challenge has just been adjusting to a different point of view on the field. “I got to get my reaction time up,” he said. “That’s definitely a big part of it. So far it’s just been smooth. The coaches, they really help it be smooth. Also (Brandon Wellington) and Kyler (Manu), I ask them a question and they’re helping me out. It’s been smooth. Nothing but easy so far.”<|im_end|>

# Scientists find Tatooine-like planet orbiting 2 suns far, far from Earth

SAN DIEGO (DPA) - Scientists had yet to discover proof that a single planet can orbit two stars when Luke Skywalker was shown watching a twin sunset from Tatooine in the 1977 science-fiction film "Star Wars."  But they later nailed it. And San Diego State University astronomers have just revealed fresh evidence that there's likely to be many of these Tatooine-like worlds far, far from Earth.  Scientists Jerry Orosz and Bill Welsh reported on Monday (April 15) in Astronomical Journal they have found a third planet circling a pair of stars in a region of constellation Cygnus, roughly 3,400 light-years way.  Welsh and Orosz were part of the team that found the first two "circumbinary" planets in 2011.  "The system is more complicated than we knew," Orosz said on Tuesday.  "This newly discovered planet is the largest of the three, and it is located between the two others. We didn't see it until we had more data of that area. It shows you the staggering variety in the galaxy."  This is the first time scientists have found three planets orbiting a pair of stars. The newest planet has been given the name Kepler-47d.  The evidence came from NASA's Kepler space telescope, which spent years searching the cosmos for Earth-like planets. Astronomers were able to spot them because planets periodically pass in front of stars, causing their perceptible light to briefly dim.  "Think of a bug crawling across the headlight of a motorcycle," Orosz said. "The human eye wouldn't pick it up if the person was too far away. But a super camera would. And that's what Kepler was."  The Kepler mission ended last year, after discovering thousands of planets beyond our solar system known as exoplanets.  Orosz and Welsh focused their attention on a system known as Kepler-47, which has two stars making it a so-called binary system.  About half of the stars seen in the night sky are binaries.  One of the stars in Kepler-47 is far bigger than the other. The stars orbit each other every 7.45 days. The planets orbit the stars.  "There are no other systems like this that we know of," Welsh said Tuesday. "So Kepler-47 is telling us that multi-planet circumbinary systems do exist. Not that long ago, such planets were not thought to be possible because of the rapidly changing gravitational pull from the two stars."  But don't look to our own solar system for comparisons.  The new planet "is between the size of Neptune and Saturn, but much less massive," Welsh said. "It is much less dense than Saturn, which as some of us learned as kids, is less dense than water.  "The chemical composition is unknown - we don't have the tools just yet to get their make-up. But we are close - a decade or so away."  How long would it take a spacecraft to travel to Kepler-47d?  "I don't know exactly," Orosz said. "But it would be tens of millions of years."<|im_end|>

# Rugby Australia locks in top silks for Folau fight

The man who got Rugby Australia out of jail on the Western Force saga and was embroiled in a bitter battle with former Commonwealth Attorney-General George Brandis will fight for the organisation's right to sack Israel Folau. RA has again engaged Justin Gleeson SC, one of Australia's top silks, to argue its case in the looming code-of-conduct hearing over Folau's anti-gay and transgender social media postings. Sydney-based Gleeson acted for RA in a successful defence of its decision to axe the Western Force from Super Rugby in 2017, the year after he was forced to resign his position as the second-highest law officer in Australia after a public feud with Brandis. While a date for Folau's code-of-conduct hearing has still not been set down, both parties have been assembling their legal teams; RA mustering two of the biggest names in the legal profession. Alongside Gleeson, the organisation selected high-profile workplace discrimination and sexual harassment silk Kate Eastman SC as its nomination to the three-person panel tasked with ruling on the matter. Eastman is believed to be the first woman appointed to a code-of-conduct hearing in Australian rugby. Something of a rock star of the Australian legal landscape, she commentates regularly on employment law, sexual discrimination and harassment and human rights. She will join highly regarded sports administrator John Boultbee, the Rugby Union Players' Association's pick who also sat on the panel that decided Kurtley Beale's fate in his 2014 code-of-conduct hearing. John West QC, another employment law expert and vastly experienced senior counsel, was agreed upon as the independent appointment. Israel Folau has engaged solicitor Ramy Qutami to be in his corner. Qutami has more than two decades of practising experience and has acted for Jarryd Hayne and Dylan Walker, as well as convicted electoral fraudster and former Auburn mayor Salim Mehajer. The appointments came as the Waratahs again found the issue dominating the build-up to their crunch derby match against the Rebels. NSW five-eighth Bernard Foley said Folau's actions had hurt the team and when asked about how he felt about the issue, he responded: "Conflicted, I suppose. He has hurt the team, which is not why we play sport. We are a team and we encourage diversity and everything. But I also don’t think Izzy is a bad guy. So there is a lot of conflict there. "But I don’t agree with what he’s done. It’s a tough situation, so for myself personally it’s a big loss this weekend but we will deal with that. We have trained all week without him and we’re looking forward to going out there and getting the job done.” The Waratahs find themselves in a similar position to this time last year, when a hamstring injury robbed them of Folau's services and his first social media posts about gay people going to hell put the team under heavy scrutiny. "What we experienced last year was how well the side came together when the team had their backs against the wall and there was a bit of controversy," Foley said. "The side galvanised. "From that week and seeing this week, the team coming together, they know what job is at hand and there's a number of milestones we're playing for this week." The game will be captain Michael Hooper's 100th for NSW and Jed Holloway's 50th.<|im_end|>

# Fish Sells Water

by Michael Boyink, mike@douglascountyheraldcom    This was not the initial plan.  The first idea for Ava’s former Carnation plant was a bit more mundane.  Danny Fish, formerly of Fish and Sons Lumber Company in Ava, bought the building intending to rent it to a saw mill customer wanting to store wooden skids indoors.  That customer lost interest.  The second idea was to restart the building as a pallet plant. DoCo Sheltered Workshop had done just that in the building before moving to their current location.  Then over a hand of poker, a friend asked Danny if he knew about the well.  The well?  An industrial well. Drilled over 900 feet deep in 1936. Capable of outputting 250 gallons per minute. Local dairy farmers, after emptying the raw milk from their 5 gallon metal jugs, would fill them up with water from the well to take back home.  Danny and Kathy found the well.  “We had the water tested,” said Kathy Fish. “The results came back so good friends said ‘you have to sell this stuff.’”  “We just felt like God spoke,” Danny adds. “And He said ‘Here’s what you need to do with that building.’”  And that’s how a Fish decides to sell water.  But the process of getting the water to the point of being able to sell it took four years.  They had to freshen up the well with new piping. They had to completely restore the building, including the offices, lab space, and production area. They had to get sign-off from the Health Department.  And they had to navigate FDA requirements for bottling water and selling it to the public.  First, the water is filtered through a series of three filters. Then it’s purified twice – once with ultraviolet light (UV) and once with ozone. This inactivates any viruses, fungus, or other contaminants remaining in the water.  “It’s considered a ‘natural light mineral water’,” says Kathy. “We’ve added nothing to it, and we’ve taken nothing from it other than what gets caught by the filters.”  Ava Springs then packages the water into washed, sanitized, BPA-free, recyclable bottles available in either 3 gallon or five gallon sizes.  “We also have plans to put in a 16.9 ounce bottle line,” Kathy says. “Not to sell in stores, but rather for customers to private label as a marketing promotion.”  Initially Ava Springs will focus business locations in roughly an hour radius around Ava.  Rural customers can pick up water at the Ava plant, or look for Ava Springs to announce additional delivery/drop-off points.  Ava Springs water is $5.99 for 3 gallons, $7.50 for 5 gallons, and cups are $5 per 100. Dispensers are available starting at $10.50 per month.  There are no delivery charges, bottle deposits, or contracts required.  “We’ve been doing business in the Ava area for over 30 years,” Danny Fish said. “The city and people of Ava have always been good to us. Everyone has been really receptive to the bottled water business, and we’re excited to have the plant here.”  Contact Ava Springs at 417-683-2181 or find them on Facebook at facebook.com/AvaSpringsWater/.<|im_end|>

# Heartbroken Man City fans react to Champions League exit

Manchester City's Quadruple hopes are no more after they were knocked out of the Champions League by Tottenham Hotspur in dramatic circumstances.  However, the away goals rule came as a bitter blow for the Blues as they were denied a spot in the last four despite drawing the two-legged tie 4-4 on aggregate.  City could still end the season with three trophies and that would be their best-ever haul, but these Blues fans won't forget the pain of Wednesday night in a hurry:  Heartbroken.  Typical City.  Time to regroup.  Drained.  Time for the away goals rule to be scrapped?  CTID.  Truly gutted.  We'll be back next year.<|im_end|>

# 'This is not a normal year': Pesky potholes on the rise in Charlottetown | CBC News

'This is not a normal year': Pesky potholes on the rise in Charlottetown 'We’ve had a little more than normal this year, that’s for sure' Driving around Charlottetown, you may have noticed that you're bouncing around in your seat a little more lately. With the freeze and thaw that's happened this winter and spring, officials with the city's public works department say this year "is a little worse" when it comes to the number of potholes around the capital. "This is not a normal year, we've had a lot of thaw and freeze, and thaw and freeze, which creates not-ideal conditions for us," Joe MacKinnon, Charlottetown's assistant manager of public works, told CBC's Jay Scotland Monday. 'Cat and mouse game' MacKinnon said it is hard to say exactly how many potholes public works has encountered so far — but he said it's definitely more than in previous years. "We've had a little more than normal this year, that's for sure," he said. "I would only be estimating but I would have to think it's up in the high hundreds to 1,000 for sure." City crews are out every day patching holes with hot asphalt. Some of the holes will hold through the spring but some won't, which means public works will have to revisit the ones that deteriorate. "There's been a few that keep rearing their heads — Queen Street and a couple other spots," MacKinnon said. "But the boys are great, they just keep going back — it's kind of a cat-and-mouse game, but we're at it and we're staying on top of things." More P.E.I. news With files from Jay Scotland<|im_end|>

# Scarlett Johansson slams 'stalker' paparazzi after scare, plus more news

After she was chased by paparazzi as she left a taping of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on Monday, April 8, Scarlett Johansson issued a formal statement to press outlets including USA Today demanding legal action that treats such aggressors as criminal stalkers. In the statement, the star described her experience being followed by "five cars full of men with blacked-out windows who were running red lights and putting other drivers and pedestrians at risk so they could follow me to find out where I was staying and subsequently stalk me and my young daughter for the duration of my stay …," noting that "even after Princess Diana's tragic death, the laws were never changed to protect targets from the lawless paparazzi and "many paparazzi have criminal pasts and will perform criminal acts to get their shot." "All of this is perfectly legal," she continued. Scarlett went on to explain that she felt unsafe so she stopped at a police station. "I felt it was my duty as a concerned citizen who was being pursued dangerously and stalked to go to the local precinct and seek guidance there," she said. "Women across the US are stalked, harassed and frightened and a universal law to address stalking must be at the forefront of law enforcement conversations. Until paparazzi are considered by the law for the criminal stalkers they are, it's just a waiting game before another person gets seriously injured or killed, like Princess Diana."<|im_end|>

His love for the game began when he played at Oliver Ames High School as a defensive end and tight end. On the coaching side, his most recent experience includes the Saddleback Valley Blue Bears D1 junior varsity team where he coached the defensive line, winning the 2018 D3 Orange Bowl Championship and the D3 Wescon Championship, enjoying an impressive 13 – 1 season. For the prior five years, Nichols served as an assistant coach with Saddleback Valley Pop Warner, where he emphasized proper tackling and defensive techniques with youth athletes to maximize safety and performance on the field. Coach Anthony Miller – 13U Assistant Coach  Coach Miller has played and coached at both the high school and college levels, where he played defensive end and linebacker.  In youth coaching, he spent three years coaching under Mike Hamby (Trojans' 13U head coach) with Saddleback Valley Pop Warner, 13U as defensive coordinator, won the Orange Bowl in 2016; and Saddleback Valley Pop Warner 10U defensive line coach, Orange Bowl champions.

Akshay Kumar grooves with brother-in-law Karan Kapadia in a special song for his debut film Blank  Karan Kapadia’s debut film Blank will have a special number from Akshay Kumar. He shot for the song on Monday at a suburban studio in Mumbai. Akshay, who also happens to be Karan's brother-in-law, gave a shout-out to the film and shared its official trailer on 4 April.  Akshay confirmed the news and told Mumbai Mirror, “Karan has chosen an unconventional route for his debut film and I am extremely proud of him. Doing this song is my way of wishing him all the best."  The peppy track is composed by Arko and sung by B Praak, who recently lent his voice for the song 'Teri Mitti' in Akshay Kumar-starrer period-drama Kesari. The dance number is choreographed by Ranju Varghese.  Apart from Karan, Sunny Deol also stars in the lead role. Ishita Dutta Sheth, previously seen in Nishikant Kamat's thriller Drishyam and Kapil Sharma-starrer Firangi, will star opposite Karan.  The film revolves around a hardened police officer (Deol) who, along with his team, gets intel on a sleeper agent (Kapadia) after months of tracking him, only to realise that the suicide bomber has suffered a memory loss.  Directed by Behzad Khambata, the film will hit theatres on 3 May.

# 12 Royally Rad Baby Boy Names Meghan Markle Seriously Needs To Consider

For most parents, choosing a baby name is a mostly private affair; in fact, it seems many moms and dads would prefer their family and friends to keep their opinions on the subject to themselves. For royal parents-to-be Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, on the other hand, it's been practically impossible to keep anything about Markle's pregnancy private — and people especially love to speculate about what the couple will name their first child (along with the child's still-unknown gender). So which royal baby boy names might Meghan Markle be considering? If you're a betting sort, you could even turn a profit with your prediction. As Town & Country reported, betting websites including Betfair and Ladbrokes started taking wagers on the royal baby's name mere days after the pregnancy was announced last October. Unsurprisingly, the majority of people expect the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to pick a traditional name, one that's likely shown up on the royal family tree already. But who knows? Harry and Meghan are arguably the most modern majestic pair yet; there's no guarantee they'll adhere to any conventions they consider outdated. Perhaps they're even open to suggestions. Because according to CNN, while on a tour of New Zealand, Fiji, and the Kingdom of Tonga, Meghan told a young fan that she and Prince Harry had "been given a long list of names from everyone," and that they planned "to sit down and have a look at them." Hmmm. I'm not personally convinced that these two will find the name of their dreams from the slush pile, so to speak, but it's sweet that Meghan acted as if she might. Still, she and Harry will likely pick a name that's more along the lines of these following candidates... if, that is, they have a boy. (See royal baby name predictions for girls here.) 1. Albert As Harper's Bazaar reported, "if the royal baby is a boy, betting odds suggest that he could be named after Queen Victoria's beloved husband, Prince Albert." The name would make sense, especially as Meghan and Harry have moved to Frogmore Cottage to start their family (which has a special connection to both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert). 2. James James started off as a top contender for the winning baby name when the pregnancy was announced last year, according to Good Housekeeping. 3. Henry Did you know that Prince Harry's name isn't actually Harry at all? He was born Prince Henry of Wales, according to Cosmopolitan; or, to be more accurate, Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales. Henry would make a perfectly customary choice. 4. Edward Another regal name that sounds like it should come after a title like King or Prince, the current odds for Edward as the baby's name are 16/1, according to The Telegraph. 5. Arthur Arthur has been associated with royalty since the days of knights and round tables, which perhaps explains why its current odds are 12/1, according to The Telegraph. Arthur is also the middle name of Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Louis. 6. Spencer It wouldn't be a surprise at all if Harry and Meghan named a girl Diana, but they could honor Harry's late mother with this boy name, too: Spencer was Diana's maiden name. 7. Alexander Another popular prediction listed by Good Housekeeping, Alexander is a name often associated with great rulers. Will this baby grow up to be such a king? He (or she) will be pretty far down the line of succession, but one never truly knows. 8. Philip 9. Shane Following Harry and Meghan's trip to Australia last fall, Prince Charles made a joke about how they'd probably pick an Australian name for the baby: "Incidentally ladies and gentlemen my son Harry tells me that during their recent tour of Australia, he and his wife were offered countless thoughtful suggestions for the naming of their forthcoming baby," Charles said, according to the Evening Standard. "Just between us, I suspect that Kylie and Shane may possibly make the shortlist." Well, Shane *is* very Australian. 10. Jake One of Princess Diana’s godsons, according to Australian Vogue, Jake Warren grew up with Prince Harry, both of them attending the same primary and high schools; they're still seen together often, and "as the son of the Queen’s horse racing manager, Warren is often found trackside." Not everyone wants to name their firstborn child after a friend, but Jake would be a good choice if Harry were to try that tactic. 11. Francis 12. Alvin Just because Meghan doesn't come from royalty doesn't mean she can't look to her own family for inspo... particularly her much-loved maternal grandfather, Alvin Ragland, who passed away in 2011 at the age of 82, according to The Daily Mail.<|im_end|>

# GVSD Board Releases New Mission Statement - PembinaValleyOnline.com

Every four years after an election, Garden Valley School Division trustees take the time to review their mission and belief statements.  Board Chair Laurie Dyck says this is done to ensure they are still saying what's intended, with the direction the division is taking. Dyck says the board began conversations during their strategic planning sessions earlier this year.  In the end, she says the board decided it would condense its mission statement into language their students could better relate to.  The new mission statement is, "learning and discovering together, to be good neighbours, workers, and citizens."  Previously, it read, "the mission of Garden Valley School Division is to facilitate excellent education for children to become good neighbours, workers, and citizens."  Dyck says the board will give final reading to the new mission statement at its May 14th board meeting.<|im_end|>

# Investigators Have An Idea About What Caused The Notre Dame Fire

What Started The Notre Dame Fire? Investigators Have An Idea After a portion of the mighty Notre Dame Cathedral caught fire on Monday, French officials did not take long to initiate a probe into the source of the flames. On Thursday, a French judicial police official told the Associated Press that local investigators suspect an electrical short-circuit is possibly how the Notre Dame fire started. The official spoke on condition of anonymity and told the Associated Press that efforts to search the rubble had yet to start as the authorities did not have the clearance to head inside the cathedral for safety reasons. Certain parts of the over 850-year-old church were being erected with wooden planks to provide support in the more damaged and delicate parts of the cathedral, according to the official. On Wednesday, a French judicial authority told CNN that Paris prosecutors had questioned some 40 Notre Dame Cathedral employees about the Monday fire. According to the official, French police authorities said the fire was probably an accident but that they were not ruling out other lines of inquiry. "While the prosecutor's office does not rule out any hypothesis, we remind that at this stage, nothing in the investigations highlights a criminal origin. Accidental causes remain our privileged lead," the French prosecutor's office told CNN. According to CNN, the Notre Dame Cathedral was being renovated at the time of the fire. Specifically, the church's 150-year-old spire caught fire and collapsed on Monday. At the time, four companies were hired to carry out the renovations, per CNN. Architectural work by two of them was ongoing where the fire began but CNN noted that no workers were present at the church at the time of the incident. Renovation work at the church, where flames raged for about nine hours, has been taking place for some time now. In 2017, for instance, the cathedral's spokesman, Andre Finot, told The New York Times that the Notre Dame Cathedral was in dire need of restorative changes, especially given the decaying architecture in certain parts of the church. Renovation projects carry the risk to cause volatile and at times even dangerous conditions for buildings. Experts like associate professor Glenn Corbett, who teaches fire science at John Jay College in New York, told The New York Times on Monday that even the slightest open flame could spark intense fires. It's happened before, Corbett explained to the publication. "There's a history of churches and synagogues and other houses of worship falling victim to construction fires," he said. As authorities attempt to understand and confirm what exactly turned parts of the massive cathedral into an inferno, people have expressed empathy for those stricken by the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. On Wednesday, The Associated Press reported that Polish rabbis penned a letter to Polish bishops, saying, "We as Jews know what it means to see your house of worship burning," they wrote. The rabbis added that the grief felt by looking at the cathedral on fire was understandable. "These experiences have made us very sensitive," they wrote, "and aware of the pain and horror of the destruction of any house of worship."<|im_end|>

# Malayah Stewart: The Business of Fashion

Malayah Stewart: The Business of Fashion  Graduating from Southern Methodist University this December, Malayah Stewart is already making plans to become a graduate student in the business of fashion.  “I’m thinking about applying to New York University or London College of Fashion, both programs have a really great MBA program for students who want to really master the business of fashion,” Malayah said.  Majoring in fashion media with a minor in advertising, Malayah believes she has what it takes to receive an MBA. Malayah said, “currently I’m studying for the GMAT which is a really rigorous test considering that I’m not actually majoring in business.” She also plans to visit both NYU and London College of Fashion to see which one is the best fit for her.  After realizing that the fashion industry is worth more than a trillion dollars, Malayah realized this was something she wants to involve herself in. “And I think getting an MBA in something that is concentrated will not only benefit me, but will benefit society,” Malayah said.  Malayah said the most difficult part of her journey is living in Texas and wants to move to a city that is more focused on fashion. “It’s a great state, but if I’m wanting to get my masters in something that is so concentrated as fashion, then living in Texas does nothing for me.”  When it comes to advice for students who are on the fence on attending graduate school, Malayah said, “just go out there and do it, and once you find your niche and once you find out what you want to do in life, don’t hold back and figure out what the next step is.” Malayah also advises students to have a mentor. “Believe in yourself and believe that you can do it.”  She is still unsure when exactly she will take the GMAT, but she said that most likely it will be this August. “I’ve been studying for a while, but I’m still debating whether or not I should hire a tutor, so once I figure it out, I will finalize the details for when I will take my test.”  Malayah said she plans on taking a few months off until she enters graduate school, but in the meantime, she will most likely work a job until the program she chooses starts.<|im_end|>

# ‘Teen Mom OG’ Star Ryan Edwards’ Wife Mackenzie Debuts ‘I Love You Tattoo’ After His Release From Jail

Ryan Edwards’ wife, Mackenzie Standifer, recently took to her Instagram page to debut a brand new tattoo.  Just days after the Teen Mom OG cast member and father of two was released from jail after a three-month stint, his wife of nearly two years posted a photo of her new ink, which read, “I Love You,” to her online audience.  On April 18, In Touch Weekly shared a photo of Standifer’s tattoo with readers, revealing the reality star’s new piece is located on her forearm.  As fans have likely heard, Edwards was released from custody earlier this week after spending months behind bars following a slew of charges, including a theft charge from 2018. Although Edwards has continuously found himself in trouble with the law, and struggled with drugs for years, his wife, Standifer, has continued to stick my him and at the end of last year, she gave birth to their baby boy, Jagger Ryan.  Edwards is also dad to 10-year-old Bentley, who he shares with ex-girlfriend Maci Bookout.  In addition to Edwards’ recent stint in jail, the reality star also participated in a recent trip to rehab at the end of last year, where he was believed to be treating an addiction to heroin.  Edwards’ first stint in treatment occurred in 2017, just after he and Standifer got married.  While Edwards was not featured at all during the latest season of Teen Mom OG, Standifer announced earlier this year on Instagram that she and Edwards will be participating in the upcoming season of the show.  “We are filming for this season, we filmed a bunch of episodes thus far,” Standifer said in March, according to a report from The Ashley’s Reality Roundup. “You’re probably going to be bored out of your mind…Ryan’s not off the show [anymore].”  According to Standifer, she and Edwards attempted to get out of their contracts to appear on Teen Mom OG but weren’t “allowed” to leave. She also slammed her MTV producers, telling her online audience they are “very big instigators.”  “This season, I just don’t care anymore. If I don’t want to talk about something, I’m not going to just because they ask me to,” she said.  During last year’s season, Standifer was seen in just a cameo role as she spoke to Edwards’ mom about her step-son’s schooling.  To see more of Edwards, Standifer, and their co-stars, don’t miss new episodes of Teen Mom OG when the show returns to MTV later this year.<|im_end|>

# Peyton baseball defeats Calhan in four innings, hopes for another deep postseason run

PEYTON - After falling in the Class 2A state title game last year it didn’t take long for the Peyton baseball team to start to look forward to another run in 2019. It would just be a matter of getting there. Now more than midway though the regular season the Panthers are on their way as the state’s only undefeated program in classes 2A through 5A. Thursday Peyton continued its streak with a mercy-rule 15-0 win over rival Calhan after a less-than-comfortable game on Tuesday. The Panthers beat opponents by an average of 13 runs per game, but in Game 1 of the 2A District 8 series, the Bulldogs came out with fire. But Peyton ultimately pulled off a 4-0 win and used that game as motivation heading into Game 2. “When we played on Tuesday they had more energy, more focus and they were more fired up, and it showed. They came out the other day and they just wanted it more,” said Peyton coach Kelly Nickell. “So we talked about coming out and making sure we matched their intensity and working hard from the first pitch to the last pitch.” Using momentum from a solid performance from pitcher Rupert Shaw in the top of the second, Peyton’s bats went to work. Brennen Meyers knocked a first-pitch double to center to lead off the inning, followed by an RBI double by Trevor Walker. With two outs on the board the lineup flipped and it began raining doubles as Brandon Hussey, Jaeden Meyeres, Shaw, and Josh Gonzales each knocked extra-base hits to give Peyton a quick 8-0 lead. Shaw and Rodney Gregg would drive in two more runs in the third, followed by a two-RBI single by Shaw in the fourth, and a game-ending three-run walk-off home run by Gregg with one out in the bottom of the fourth. “First pitch curveball down low but I was hunting the fastball, so I saw a fastball coming down the middle and wanted to put a good swing on it and just watched it go over the fence,” Gregg said. “Tuesday’s game the bats weren’t as hot so it was nice to come back today, especially when you see that everybody is putting the ball in play.” Shaw finished the shortened outing allowing one hit and striking out eight batters. Calhan’s Logan Glaser was the lone Bulldog to register a hit. With seven games left in the regular season 12-0 Peyton has two more games scheduled against top-10 2A teams, Front Range Christian and Dayspring Christian. Gregg said the team is looking at those two games as ways the Panthers can prove themselves heading into the postseason. “I think this year is a little different we’re all getting better and this team is pretty special. I’m really proud of this group to come back after that tough (loss in the state championship) to come back and say, ‘Coach, I’m ready’,” Gregg said. “We’re good but we still have to put in the work and show everyone how good we are.”<|im_end|>

# Jim Jarmusch zombie film The Dead Don't Die to open Cannes

This year’s Cannes film festival is set to kick off with Jim Jarmusch’s The Dead Don’t Die, a star-studded zombie movie in which the undead battle local cops Bill Murray, Chloë Sevigny and Adam Driver.  The comedy, which will be in contention for top prize the Palme d’Or, has been selected as the opening night movie on 14 May, and will be released in France on the same day, before premiering elsewhere in June.  Jarmusch won the Caméra d’Or first film prize in 1984 for Stranger Than Paradise and has returned to the festival with most of his films, including Paterson, which also starred Driver, in 2016. Other titles premiered by the director at Cannes include Broken Flowers, which starred Murray and Swinton, as well as Only Lovers Left Alive, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Dead Man, Mystery Train and Down By Law. Coffee and Cigarettes: Somewhere in California won the short film Palme d’Or in 1993.  This year’s Cannes jury will be chaired by Alejandro González Iñárritu. The festival will be on until 25 May and other titles rumoured to be playing include Pedro Almodóvar’s Pain and Glory, Dexter Fletcher’s Rocketman and Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. No Netflix titles will screen at the festival after artistic director Thierry Frémaux failed to reach a compromise with Netflix boss Ted Sarandos over whether they would be eligible for competition.<|im_end|>

# Apex Legends to soon start penalizing players for leaving matches early

Battle royale games have won the world over because they are fun, and can be played with friends. From PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds to Fortnite and now the new Apex Legends allow players to player with their friends to make the games more social. But there are some negative aspects of letting players play with their friends as well, and that is, if someone in the team dies, the other tend to leave that match in favor of starting a fresh one where everyone can play together again. This seems reasonable from one perspective, that no one should wait, while it does spoil the game for other players by drastically cutting down the number of players.  And now it seems Apex Legends developers have made a script that would punish players for leaving a match early. It was accidentally activated when the newest patch 1.1 was released for the game. For the record, the 1.1 patch did comes with a lot of irregularities that caused a tizzy in the offices of the developers and players accounts were wiped clean of all their match records and activities. to put it simply all progression from certain accounts was erased. That seems to have been fixed by moving all the data back to the correct servers from the incorrect ones that they had been moved to.  Respawn community manager Jayfresh wrote on Reddit about the situation of early leavers who mess up the game for the remaining squad and said, “So internally, we have been working on and testing this feature but it wasn’t our intention or plan to have it go live with the update that went out today. There was a piece of script that was missing and caused the leaving match early penalty to be turned on when it shouldn’t be. That’s why it wasn’t in the patch notes.”  WATCH: Vivo APEX First Look  “We updated the script, tested with QA and it’s now disabled for all platforms. We don’t have an ETA for if or when this would come out for real. Apologies for the confusion,” he added. Respawn even clarified that this penalty won’t be applied if your team wasn’t full or for players who were actually dead, which meaning that players won’t be punished if they left before waiting for the respawn timer to hit zero. We’ll have to wait and see how this is implemented to the game and when.<|im_end|>

# Boeing 737 MAX Not Too Big To Have Failed, Driverless Cars Not Too Small To Fail Too

The difficulties facing the Boeing 737 MAX 8 have dominated the airline industry news of late and the story about what went wrong and how to fix it are still evolving. At this stage, it is nonetheless possible to leverage what has so far emerged to draw a parallel to the self-driving driverless car realm, allowing for insightful lessons learned about the MAX, the hard way, as an aid and forewarning about autonomous car development.  As indicated by noted philosopher George Santayana, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.  Boeing 737 MAX Particulars  The Boeing 737 has been around since the late 1960s and has evolved over time, leading to the NG (Next Generation) series of the 1990s and then the MAX series became the successor to the NG. Boeing opted to retrofit the 737 for the MAX series by mounting the engines further forward and higher than the prior designs. This tended to potentially cause an upward pitching effect in some flight circumstances, and so a new hardware/software system was added to push the nose down when presumably desired, a system known as MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System).    The question arises as to when should the MCAS try to push down the nose of the plane, a quite serious action and one that needs to be undertaken with great care and rationale. The computer hardware and software of MCAS would need to know the angle of the plane to ascertain whether a nose down nudge might be warranted, and thus the Angle of Attack (AOA) sensors mounted on the plane were chosen to provide such data to MCAS.  On paper, this all sounds hunky-dory. Seemingly good news, an added system to augment the human pilots and aid in dealing with a known characteristic of the plane. Makes sense.  As with most things in life, though, the devil is in the details. You can implement this overall notion in a multitude of ways, some of which might be more, or less, a capable and suitable feature. Tough design choices come to play. Currently, there are various governmental efforts underway to trace how the particular approach of implementation was determined, which will likely provide added lessons learned.  You are undoubtedly aware that the Boeing 737 MAX 8 was sadly involved in two fatal crashes, one on October 29, 2018, which was Lion Air flight 610, and another fatal crash on March 10, 2019, the Ethiopian Airlines flight 302.  So far, it appears that the MCAS was integral to those two crashes.  Lessons Learned For Driverless Cars  There are actually several lessons already that can be gleaned from what is known today about the situation, or at least what has been reported in the media about the matter. Even if there are later reports that opt to recast what was previously thought, or add new elements, you can still consider these lessons as worthwhile to observe, regardless of their veracity specific to the Boeing 737 MAX 8.  • Retrofits Versus Starting Anew  Some have pointed fingers at the retrofit of the NG and suggested that the choice of engine placement for the MAX led to a “problem” that never should have arisen (the nose upward pitching effect), which presumably a start-from-scratch approach would have not had.  You might be under the belief that driverless cars are not prone to a retrofit since they are so new, but you’d be mistaken. Many of the driverless car designs of today are based on prior designs, logically so, attempting to build upon what already works.  Lesson #1: Auto makers and tech firms making driverless cars need to be mindful of how their retrofits can be a boon or a bane in terms of the autonomous capability and safety.  • Sensors Criticality  It has been reported that apparently the MCAS relied on just one of the two AOA sensors on the plane, rather than trying to use both, and that the MCAS might have been misled by a faulty AOA sensor reading, telling MCAS a higher angle than true and spurring MCAS to push the nose downward, doing so needlessly and worse so dangerously.  For driverless cars, they are chock full of sensors, cameras aplenty, radar, ultra-sonic sensors, LIDAR (light and radar), and so on. They are the eyes and ears of the autonomous car, without which the self-driving car is blind and would be a frantic menace to all while in-motion.  Lesson #2: Driverless cars need to employ multiple sensors that act redundantly in case any or some of them falter or fail, there should not be any single point-of-failures that can doom the driving effort.  Lesson #3: The sensor fusion that attempts to combine together the sensor readings needs to do so with aplomb, identifying which sensors are working properly and which are misreporting the driving environment, and not become fooled or misled by out-of-whack sensors.  • Human Factors Given Their Due  There is controversy associated with the piloting of the Boeing 737 MAX in that some contend that the pilots might not have had sufficient training about the MCAS aspects, plus the MCAS was apparently setup to proceed without necessarily alerting the pilot (an add-on), and the MCAS was given wide latitude of how often and how far it could nudge down the nose of the plane on its own. These are vital design choices that relate to the Human Factors involved in co-sharing the human-machine flying effort.  For driverless cars less than a Level 5 (Level 5 is the highest level and considered true autonomy that does not require the presence of a human driver), the lesser levels are essentially co-sharing the driving task, similar in a manner to how a pilot might co-share the flying with the MCAS.  Lesson #4: The driverless car when co-sharing needs to ensure that the human driver is aware of what the automation is doing versus what the human is expected to do, it’s a somber life-minding dance for both parties.  Lesson #5: It needs to be abundantly clear as to what training the human driver needs for the driving co-sharing effort, and the training has to be undertaken and reinforced over time.  Lesson #6: Design choices for co-shared human-machine driverless cars must take into account human driver frailties, including lack of human attention to the task, human speed-of-response to urgencies, etc.  Conclusion  I’ve touched upon just some of the key lessons learned based on the recent flight tragedies and assure you that there are many more such lessons hidden within the matter.  Beyond using those lessons for improving airplanes and airplane systems, it is important and useful to extend those automation insights into the realm of self-driving driverless cars. Nothing is too big or too small to fail, and it is prudent to consider how failings can hopefully be prevented or mitigated by design and implementation choices made.<|im_end|>

Canadians Used Over $298 Billion In Home Equity To Secure Loans The total of loans secured with residential loans ripped to a new all-time high.

# ‘Hero’ mom lures armed man away from daughters as he was on crime spree in California

Marylou Villalobos Palos shouted for help as a California man armed with a knife chased her through a neighborhood in Lake Forest, California, video shows.  Palos, 42, was running away from 25-year-old James Carlos Melendrez, police say, as the man went on a wild 9-minute rampage Tuesday that involved carjacking a BMW, running into a pedestrian and then crashing into another vehicle.  Police say the man, who was arrested after a bicyclist pepper-sprayed him, also broke into Palos’ home and grabbed a kitchen knife.  Both of her daughters, ages 13 and 15, were inside the home when police say the stranger broke in after shattering a window, according to KTLA5. So Palos tried to lure the man away from her daughters by running out of the house and into the surrounding neighborhood.  Evelyn Palos, 15, recalled the frightening moments before her mom sprinted outside as the knife-wielding man ran after her.  “I was in the bathroom, and my sister was in her room,” Evelyn said, according to KTLA5. “That’s just when I heard glass fall, and (Melendrez) went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife.”  Her 13-year-old sister, Elizabeth, told CBSLA that their mom “did save our lives.”  “That’s an awesome thing; My mom is the best,” Elizabeth said, according to CBSLA. ”I love her so much. I’m grateful to have a mom like that.”  Surveillance video obtained by KTLA5 from a nearby house shows Palos running and screaming “help” as she makes her way down a neighborhood street.    A man whom police identified as Melendrez runs after the woman, whose pace begins to slow before she runs out of sight, the video shows.  Melendrez eventually stabbed Palos about 20 times “around the face, neck and upper body,” police say, according to CBSLA.  Enrique Palos called his wife “a hero” as she recovers in the hospital, according to KTLA5.  Melendrez has a $2 million bail as he faces charges of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, aggravated mayhem and burglary, among others, according to The Orange County Register.  “A motive for his alleged attacks wasn’t known,” the newspaper reported.<|im_end|>

# Israel Folau investigated for new anti-gay remarks after saying ‘Hell awaits homosexuals’ - Independent.ie

Israel Folau investigated for new anti-gay remarks after saying ‘Hell awaits homosexuals’  Israel Folau is being investigated by Rugby Australia’s integrity unit after resuming his anti-gay tirade on social media, claiming “Hell awaits you” to anyone who identifies as homosexual in comments that have been labelled “unacceptable” by his employers.  The 73-cap Australia international was last year warned for making homophobic comments on social media, which he explained were based on his religious beliefs. Rugby Australia chief executive Raelene Castle elected not to discipline the full-back despite a number of sponsors threatening to walk away from the national team due to his comments, but she did remind him of his “obligation to use social media in a respectful way”.  But Folau now faces the wrath of RA after issuing a fresh attack on homosexual people among other groups, including “drunks”, “liars” and “atheists” in an Instagram post that calls for people to “Repent” as “Only Jesus Saves”.  The image, which was posted on Wednesday night in Australia, added the caption: “Those that are living in Sin will end up in Hell unless you repent. Jesus Christ loves you and is giving you time to turn away from your sin and come to him.  “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these , adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Galatians 5:19-21 KJV.”       View this post on Instagram     Those that are living in Sin will end up in Hell unless you repent. Jesus Christ loves you and is giving you time to turn away from your sin and come to him. _______________ Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these , adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Galatians 5:19‭-‬21 KJV _______________ Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 2:38 KJV _______________ And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: Acts 17:30 KJV _______________  Rugby Australia issued a statement on Wednesday to condemn his actions and confirm that an investigation is underway.  An RA statement read: “Rugby Australia is aware of a post made by Israel Folau on his Instagram account this afternoon.  “The content within the post is unacceptable. It does not represent the values of the sport and is disrespectful to members of the rugby community.  “The Rugby Australia integrity (unit) has been engaged on the matter tonight (Wednesday).”  The post was the second controversial social media outburst by Folau on Wednesday, as he also used Twitter to attack the gender birth certificate debate following Tasmania’s decision to become Australia’s first jurisdiction that allows gender to be optional at birth   The devil has blinded so many people in this world, REPENT and turn away from your evil ways. Turn to Jesus Christ who will set you free. pic.twitter.com/BWSWTMye98 — Israel Folau (@IzzyFolau) April 10, 2019 "The devil has blinded so many people in this world, REPENT and turn away from your evil ways. Turn to Jesus Christ who will set you free," he posted.  The former rugby league and Australian Football League player has previously expressed his opposition to same-sex marriage by claiming gay people would go to hell, which led to a fierce backlash against the New South Wales Waratahs player.  The 30-year-old, who last weekend broke the all-time record for tries scored in Super Rugby with his 60th try in six years, had not posted anything on his Instagram account since early February before Wednesday’s anti-gay outburst, and he could now face disciplinary action by RA following his previous reminder to use his accounts in a “respectful way”.  Folau, an active member of the Assemblies of God fellowship and devout Christian, has previously denied that he is bigoted of homophobic, but offered to walk away from his contract with the Australian governing body last year if “the situation had become untenable”.  But despite pressure from sponsors, no disciplinary action was taken, and he signed a long-term extension in October 2018 that will run until the end of the 2022 season. Main Wallabies sponsor Qantas threatened to sever their ties with the national team over the matter, while Land Rover took back a sponsored vehicle that had been given to the Waratahs back.  Any disciplinary action could impact Folau’s participation in the upcoming Rugby Championship, which begins with a shorter six-match format in July involving Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Argentina, as well as this year’s Rugby World Cup in Japan. If found to be a serious breach of contract, RA could choose to tear up Folau’s contract and sack him little more than five months before the start of the Rugby World Cup.  Online Editors<|im_end|>

# Here are the biggest analyst calls of the day: Apple, Chipotle, IBM, Xerox, U.S. Steel & more

Here are the biggest calls on Wall Street on Thursday  Jefferies downgraded Chipotle to 'hold' from 'buy'  Jefferies downgraded CMG mostly on valuation.   "With CMG stock up +65% (vs +13% S&P) in 1Q, we believe valuation is full and reflects improved visibility for powerful SSS and margin drivers. We expect CMG to post strong 1Q results on April 24, with potential upside to our/consensus SSS of +6.5% and EPS (we are 13% above the Street) on flow-through, although beef and marketing headwinds are likely. Despite NT sentiment risk related to avocado prices, we raise our PT to $700 and cut our rating to Hold." Read more about this call here.  Credit Suisse initiated Apple as 'neutral'  Credit Suisse said Apple's iPhone sales are in a, "difficult," spot and that it will take time to see how its service business pans out.   "As Apple's iPhone matures, the company is looking to transform itself into a more recurring, higher-growth, and ultimately higher-value business as it pushes to increasingly monetize its massive 900mn iPhone installed base. We recognize the potential in the shift to Services, which we expect will reach $65bn in revenue by FY21, but believe it will take time for that view to play out. Near-term upside from here likely requires the multiple to re-rate higher; investor perception of Apple as a hardware-centric company will be hard to shake against a backdrop of double-digit iPhone sales declines (CSe -11% y/y in CY19), in our view. With the stock up 40% from its Jan low and near a peak multiple (15x CY20 EPS), we remain on the sidelines awaiting a better entry point and/or line-of-sight to significant Services-led upside to break out of the historical valuation range." Credit Suisse initiated IBM as 'outperform'   "IBM is standing on the precipice of change, with the pending Red Hat (RHT) acquisition marking a landmark shift in strategy and bringing a potential return to true revenue-driven EPS growth vs. years of over-reliance on lower-quality drivers. The combination significantly improves IBM's positioning in the rapid push toward hybrid cloud, bringing together the platform, incumbency, and expertise necessary to help customers with the vast majority (~80%) of applications that have yet to migrate to the public cloud. We see meaningful financial opportunity longer term, as we estimate ~10% FCF accretion within three years that should enable sustained dividend growth (4.4% yield currently) despite rapid debt repayment. We see a potential negative surprise from sizeable near-term EPS dilution (~11% impact in CY20E); we are undeterred, as the biggest drag is from the required writedown of Red Hat's deferred revenue under GAAP accounting which has no material impact on FCF and should fade quickly thereafter. Further, the acquisition has yet to close; while IBM is confident in a 2H19 timeline, we nonetheless acknowledge it represents risk to our view." Credit Suisse initiated Xerox as 'outperform'  Credit Suisse sees significant opportunity with Xerox in a, "secularly declining industry."   "We believe Xerox is in the early stages of a multi-year margin expansion and FCF self-help story. Despite challenges to revenue growth amid a secularly declining industry, we see significant opportunity trapped in opex and working capital to unlock." Morgan Stanley downgraded Keurig Dr Pepper to 'underweight' from 'equal-weight'  Morgan Stanley downgraded KDP saying they see single-serve coffee penetration is slowing down.   "We are downgrading KDP to UW from EW, with our survey and analysis underpinning our ~250 bps downside in coffee system sales growth relative to high market expectations of ~4% priced into the stock from a DCF-implied standpoint. Our ~80 bps below consensus corporate revenue forecast is supported by takeaways from our survey in terms of slowing household penetration and further pressure in pod pricing. From a valuation standpoint, a high valuation bar (~17x NTM EV/EBITDA) and our below-consensus estimates create a -2.3:1.0 negatively skewed risk-reward. We are lowering our KDP price target by ~11%, from $27 to $24, reflecting our lower coffee estimates and a lower assumed multiple." Bank of America downgraded U.S. Steel to 'underperform' from 'buy'  Bank of America double downgraded the stock and said market conditions are deteriorating in the U.S.   "We downgrade U.S. Steel to Underperform from Buy on worse near-term U.S. market conditions than we anticipated, with channel checks telling us not only have recent price hikes not stuck but benchmark hot rolled coil retreated to its lows of the year in recent days. A sharply lower scrap price, down ~$25/t m/m for April defied higher global iron ore prices, and has pressured U.S. steel lower. Without a more confident 2019E price view, we see limited catalysts in light of our Steelmageddon™ thesis materializing in late 2020E/early 2021E. Our new $18 PO falls from a prior $31 on the lower steel price forecasts and using 5x 2019E EV/EBITDA and 6x 2020E, under its historical 7x." Guggenheim downgraded Eli Lilly to 'neutral' from 'buy'  Guggenheim said LLY has the best "long-term growth" in pharma but thinks that is already priced in to the stock.   "In our view, LLY has the best long-term growth profile in US Pharma, that growth is the broad consensus, and we believe this is largely priced into the stock given its EV/EBIT premium to the group. We believe management has done an impressive job delivering, but we see limited upside from here until competition from NOVO's semaglutide franchise and LLY's overall immunology portfolio is more fully understood. As a result, we are downgrading LLY to Neutral but are now removing our price target and estimate the fair value to be in the range of $125-135/share." J.P. Morgan upgraded Five Below to 'overweight' from 'neutral'  J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock after meeting with management saying they see, "high visibility to +20% annual net income growth."   "FIVE targets 20% annual revenue growth on high-teens unit growth expansion and low-single-digit comps (i.e., +3.0%) with roughly flat margins and a 3% fixed cost hurdle equating to 20% net income growth. Importantly, we see high visibility to +20% annual net income growth based on (1) high-teens unit growth with new store returns the sole governor, (2) low-single-digit "core" comps (ex craze trends) on positive store traffic, and (3) margin expansion driven by scale citing opportunity to reduce today's +3% fixed cost hurdle over time. We upgrade to Overweight and raise our Dec '19 price target to $150 (was $133) based on 40x our FY20E EPS, representing a 1.8x PEG on our FY20/21 model and management's long-term annual 20% net income growth profile representing a premium to 1.5x 2020E growth peer average." HSBC initiated Lyft as 'neutral'  HSBC said they like Lyft's prospects but that their number 2 position may put them at a disadvantage.   "We are bullish on the growth prospects for ride-hailing, but as the clear No. 2 in the US, Lyft is likely to face a bumpy ride. Autonomous driving could be a game changer for ride-hailing, but this looks unlikely before 2025. Lyft's recent IPO is expected to be the first of several by ride-hailing companies around the world. We build on our previous deep dive into the fundamentals of the ride-hailing industry to value Lyft, providing a framework to assess other players in this fast-growing sector. We initiate coverage of Lyft with a Hold rating and TP of USD60."<|im_end|>

# I’ve been using the Samsung Galaxy Fold for almost a week, and my favorite thing about it isn’t the folding screen

source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider  The trademark feature on Samsung’s Galaxy Fold is its foldable display, which enables it to function as both a smartphone and a tablet. But it was the device’s long battery life that impressed me most. I was able to use the Galaxy Fold for two full days without plugging it in. There’s nothing typical about the way Samsung’s Galaxy Fold looks or how it works.  The Fold, which starts at $1,980 and hits stores on April 26, is the company’s first foldable phone. It opens like a book to reveal a large, flexible screen on the inside that enables it to serve as both a smartphone and a tablet, with its front and back panels connected by a custom-designed hinge.  But after spending nearly one week with the device, it’s not the Fold’s unconventional design that stood out to me the most. Rather, it’s the Galaxy Fold’s extensive battery life – which lasted for two full days on a single charge – that left me impressed. I charged the device overnight on a Tuesday and unplugged it around 7:45 a.m. on Wednesday when I left home to commute to work. It lasted all day Wednesday and the following day before it finally died overnight on Thursday going into Friday morning.  The Galaxy Fold has a 4,380 mAh dual battery, which means the phone actually has two batteries – one on each side of the device. But Samsung says it’s built custom technology to combine the energy from two batteries into one power source.  Many large-screened smartphones offer lengthy battery life, but they don’t seem to last quite as long as the Galaxy Fold. Reviews of the Galaxy S10+, for instance, indicated that the phone persisted for an entire day with some battery life to spare, while iPhone XS Max reviews suggested the phone lasts for about a whole day.  That’s about on par with my usual experience with modern phones like the S10+ and iPhone XS Max. I can typically get through an entire day with some power left over at night. If I choose not to plug in my phone before going to sleep, I could probably get through about half of my work day the following day. But certainly not an entire additional day.  Of course, battery life will always vary depending on how you use your smartphone. During my time with the Fold, I typically used it for sending messages, perusing Facebook and Instagram, watching Netflix, playing games like “Asphalt 9,” and browsing the web. But you’ll likely experience slightly different results, and could see a dip in battery life if you do things like crank up the brightness to the highest setting and often run power-hungry apps.  Have you preordered the Galaxy Fold? We want to hear from you. Contact this reporter at leadicicco@businessinsider.com<|im_end|>

# Miami Hurricanes rave about spring game in Orlando, hope to close gap before facing Florida Gators | Commentary

Manny Diaz and the Miami Hurricanes emerged from the cloud of white smoke and raced onto the field at Camping World Stadium. The sight of the 45-year-old first-year coach sent an announced crowd of 9,102 UM fans into a frenzy. The calendar may have read April, but the ’Canes got a sample of what they might experience on Aug. 24 during their season opener against rival Florida in the Camping World Kickoff. From the moment he took the job, Diaz’s message has been simple: It’s a new day for Miami football.  If you needed a reminder, it was plastered on the large scoreboard before the start of the game. The phrase “The New Miami” greeted fans as they entered the stadium. It’s a message Miami faithful have embraced after the Hurricanes posted a disappointing 7-6 record last year. Coach Mark Richt announced his surprise retirement after Diaz had left behind his UM defensive coordinator job to take over as head coach at Temple. Diaz changed course, leaving the Owls to take his dream job leading the Hurricanes. Diaz closed his first round of spring football workouts by making a statement, invading the heart of Gator Country to better prep his team for a showdown with UF in Orlando. “We were coming and we weren’t sure what to expect,” Diaz said of the team’s three-plus hour trip up north. “The whole 36 hours were unbelievable.”  Diaz wanted his team to experience a typical road-game week, so the ‘Canes did everything they would do normally do during a regular-season road trip — traveling on a bus and attending meetings in hotel ballrooms the night before the game. “We created as similar as possible to what it’s going to be in August. The game, the crowd and all of that really exceeded my expectations. It was better than I wanted it to be,” Diaz said. Senior linebacker Michael Pinckney said the time spent in Orlando this weekend should pay off when the team returns in 125 days. “It’s not going to be a shock to our younger guys when we travel for the first week,” Pinckney said.  Players and coaches raved about fans who attended Saturday’s spring game, greeting many of them on the field after the Hurricanes’ defense edged the offense 35-32 using a modified scoring system Diaz and his staff developed. Miami won’t settle its starting-quarterback race until preseason camp. Fans got a chance to see candidates Tate Martell, N’Kosi Perry and Jarren Williams all toss touchdown passes Saturday. The Hurricanes were looking for every advantage they could squeeze out of Saturday’s dress rehearsal for the opener against Florida. During their heydays, the two programs were perennial powers and were ranked in the top 25 during six of their past eight meetings. Yet it’s the Gators who will enter the 2019 matchup with more momentum after a turnaround season during which the team won 10 games, including a New Year’s Six bowl. UF followed that up by landing the program’s first top-10 recruiting class since 2014. And the Gators will most likely enter this coming season ranked in the top 10 for the first time since 2013. Former Miami Hurricanes coach Mark Richt discusses why he decided to step down as head coach back in December and why he's taking a job as a college football analyst for the ACC Network. Former Miami Hurricanes coach Mark Richt discusses why he decided to step down as head coach back in December and why he's taking a job as a college football analyst for the ACC Network. “It’s going to be a monster game for both teams,” said Richt, who attended Saturday’s game after being named a college football analyst for the ACC Network. “To start the college football season, [it will] probably be the only college football game on TV at that time, I think. Everybody in the world is going to be watching it and can’t wait to see any college game, let alone the Miami-vs.-Florida game.” Diaz, who developed the wildly popular turnover chain to coax maximum effort out of the Hurricanes’ defense, wants his entire roster to bring the energy that will help close the gaps between Miami and Florida. He suggested Saturday the Hurricanes are off to a good start. “What should the minimum expectation be when you come to see the Miami Hurricanes play? You should see a team that loves playing for each other, a team that plays with physicality and a team that plays with toughness,” Diaz said. “And we saw all of those today.” Twitter: @osmattmurschel Facebook: @osmattmurschel<|im_end|>

# Report: DeWitt Central accepted by the MAC

Thirteen in ‘20. That appears to be the future status of the Wamac Conference, on the heels of the news that the Mississippi Athletic Conference has accepted DeWitt Central.   According to a report by the Quad-City Times, MAC principals voted 9-0 Wednesday to accept Central’s request to join.   Central’s move will increase MAC membership to 10; the Wamac will become a league of 13 schools, unless somebody else departs or someone enters.   “We’ll try to see if anyone is interesting in joining,” Williamsburg Athletics Director Curt Ritchie said. “If not, we’ll go with 13. We’ve gone with an odd number before.”   It’s not an optimal number.   “We’d like to have an even number, but we’ve made it work before,” Ritchie said. “Last time we had an opening, there wasn’t any interest. Travel and location, it limits you a little.”   Central likely will leave for the MAC at the conclusion of the 2019-20 sports season.   It is the third school to depart in a two-year span; Western Dubuque is in its first year in the Mississippi Valley Conference; same with Anamosa and the River Valley Conference.   Central’s departure will leave Maquoketa on a geographical island. Its shortest trip in the Wamac will be 50 miles — west to Mount Vernon or northwest to Dyersville Beckman.  ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT   But AD Tom Gruenwald said when the Central-to-the-MAC process began last year that Maquoketa was “committed to the Wamac.   “It fits us best across the board. We will stay in the Wamac as long as the Wamac is the most viable option for us, and for the time being, it is.”   In terms of enrollment, Beckman is by far the smallest school in the Wamac. Beckman AD Todd Troutman has reaffirmed on multiple occasions that the league’s lone private school has no plans to leave.   l Comments: (319) 368-8857; jeff.linder@thegazette.com<|im_end|>

# TV THIS WEEK: Face Off returns, Phineas and Ferb do Star Wars, and more!

It's time for more amazing Face Off creations, and for an animated trip to a galaxy far, far away. Syfy's hit unscripted series returns for its seventh season this week, with a big twist right off the bat for the contestants. Plus, Disney and Star Wars combine in ways you might not have expected in Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars, WGN takes us inside the Manhattan Project with a new series, Ice King organizes a road trip on Adventure Time, an exorcism must be performed on Dominion, and Mega Shark returns to Syfy. Check out the week in TV below. What's on your watchlist? Highlights of the Week Face Off (Syfy) Tuesday, 9 p.m. - "Life and Death" Season premiere! - Though Syfy has taken some heat in the past from viewers who'd like to see less unscripted programming and more stuff in the vein of Battlestar Galactica, Face Off has remained a consistent hit for the network. Over three years and six seasons the show's ratings have remained strong, and it still holds many fans in its thrall, including some who might not otherwise visit a network like Syfy. Now, as season seven dawns, we'll see if it can maintain that strength. This time around we're promised "higher stakes," new judges and new challenges, including a season premiere surprise that'll be particularly hard on the contestants: The first episode is not their first challenge. It's their final audition. Check out a preview below. Extant (CBS) Wednesday, 9 p.m. - "Wish You Were Here" Before Extant premiered, I noted that last summer CBS picked up a pretty impressive genre hit with Under the Dome, and wondered if Extant could climb to those same heights in its debut. With a star like Halle Berry and executive producer Steven Spielberg's name tacked to just about every TV spot, it seemed to have a chance. So, how's the show doing as it enters its third week? Well, nearly 10 million viewers watched the series premiere, and while that number's not as strong as the more than 13 million viewers who tuned in for Under the Dome's debut, it's still impressive for a summer show existing in an age when we never stop hearing about the erosion of live TV audiences. In the key 18-49 demographic, the show pulled in a 1.6 score with its premiere, which is less than half what Dome got with its premiere last summer, but still good enough to put it in second place for the night behind network mate (and lead-in) Big Brother. Episode two's numbers revealed the show retained a pretty solid chunk of its premiere audience. It lost only about 1.5 million viewers, dropping only a tenth of a demo point, and still came in second behind Big Brother. That might not be enough to call it a smash, but so far the show's holding up pretty well. We'll see how things go this week, as Molly considers telling John about her mysterious pregnancy. Check out a preview below. Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars (Disney) Saturday, 9 p.m. One-hour special! - We don't generally cover the adventures of Phineas and Ferb here, but this particularly special episode of the series might be of interest to you, as it takes the titular heroes to a galaxy, far, far away. Featuring special guest stars Simon Pegg and MythBusters hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, this episode places Phineas and Ferb in the Star Wars universe, living on a Tatooine moisture farm right next door to Luke Skywalker's. When R2-D2 (and the Death Star plans he's carrying courtesy of Princess Leia) somehow winds up in their speeder instead of Luke's, Phineas and Ferb are sent on an intergalactic adventure featuring all of your favorite Star Wars characters. Hey, it's no Episode VII, but the Force might be with it anyway. Check out a preview below. Falling Skies (TNT) Sunday, 10 p.m. - "Door Number Three" When Falling Skies debuted in the summer of 2011, it was one of the two (along with American Horror Story) biggest new cable shows of the year in the all-important 18-49 demographic, marking a major original programming hit for TNT and launching an ambitious new sci-fi series that's continued to deliver strong numbers for its network and heavy storytelling for its viewers. Unfortunately, though its ratings are still nothing to scoff at, Falling Skies has not kept up its "biggest cable show of the year" reputation in recent seasons, and it's not just because things like The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones have overtaken it. Some shows grow as cultural phenomenons as the seasons pass, while others level off, and still others decline but remain viable. Falling Skies is in the latter category. Nearly 6 million people tuned in for the series premiere, and nearly 4.5 million returned for season two's debut. After that premiere, though, the show didn't top 4 million viewers for the rest of the season, and though season three's premiere hit the 4 million mark again, the rest of that season also failed to climb that high again, and one episode dipped below 3 million. Those are still respectable numbers, but then we come to season four. So far this season the show has only crested 3 million viewers one time, in its premiere. With that in mind, it's not surprising that TNT announced that Falling Skies will get one more season next year, and then that'll be it. It's paid dividends for its network, but it also seems to be running its course. In the meantime, though, we've still got a lot of season four left to get through. This week, Lexi faces a health crisis and Tom gets a reunion. Check out a preview below. Manhattan (WGN) Sunday, 9 p.m. - "You Always Hurt The Ones You Love" Series premiere! - This, like Halt and Catch Fire and Crossbones, isn't a genre series in the strictest terms, but it skews close enough to genre interests that we think you might want to check it out. Earlier this year WGN America debuted its first original series, the supernatural drama Salem, and it proved a strong enough show to get another year at the network. Now WGN is welcoming its second original series in Manhattan, a period drama exploring the lives of the people who worked on the Manhattan Project, the government program to develop the atomic bomb in the 1940s that still holds a mythic place in American culture. Though the show will not attempt complete historical accuracy (characters are often composites of real people, and the show's executive producers have said they're not aiming to make a docudrama), it will attempt to explore the ultra-secretive nature of the project. In a remote New Mexico town that the rest of the nation doesn't know about, scientists will have to deal with a government that only tells them what they need to know, then go home and try to keep secrets from their own families. We don't know yet how far the show will skew into the actual scientific development of the bomb, but a good drama about government secrets is always welcome (because hey, we still miss The X-Files).

# Kate Middleton Recycles Springlike Alexander McQueen Look With Gray Pumps for Easter Services

This look was so nice, Kate Middleton had to wear it twice.  On her feet, the 37-year-old appeared to be wearing Emmy London’s Rebecca “Steel” pump. Made of kid suede, the shoes feature a super straight 4.5-inch heel designed to flatter the foot. It retails for $545.  Middleton pulled together her chic ensemble with a gray bow-adorned Jane Taylor fascinator and Robinson Pelham earrings.   The coat-dress was plucked straight from the depths of the duchess’ closet, as she wore it for Easter services in 2014. Then on a trip to Australia, Middleton teamed the dress with the same Jane Taylor hat. The only swap was her shoes; five years ago, the University of St. Andrews alum selected off-white L.K. Bennett pumps with a rounded toe.   This year, Middleton was accompanied by Prince William, Prince Harry and Queen Elizabeth II, who is celebrating her 93rd birthday today. The queen was festive in a turquoise coat and matching hat (complete with pink trim). Her shoes were black low-heeled pumps.  Meghan Markle, who is awaiting the birth of her first child any day now, was not present for the festivities.  Click through the gallery to see more of Kate Middleton’s style.

# Computer model paints a 40-year picture of future worm resistance in horses - Horsetalk.co.nz

While some individuals chronicle the lifestyles of the rich and famous, equine parasitologist Martin Nielsen and his colleagues have been doing something similar with a far less star-studded line-up — small strongyles.  Nielsen and fellow researchers Christian Sauermann and Dave Leathwick have successfully applied computer modeling to simulate the effect of different factors on the development of small strongyle resistance to the common wormer ivermectin over 40 years.  The findings, reported in the journal Veterinary Parasitology, paint the clearest picture yet of how different deworming strategies are likely to play out in decades to come.  “It has taken us five years to get this model developed,” Nielsen, who is with the Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky, told Horsetalk.  “Drug resistance is slow to develop in worm parasites. It typically takes decades to emerge, so it becomes almost impossible to monitor in real-time.  “With the model we can make predictions for 20, 30, 40 years or more in the matter of a few hours.  “This will help us better understand drug resistance and help us identify the best ways to counteract it going forward.”  Small strongyles, or cyathostomins, infect virtually every grazing horse. They are capable of triggering a severe disease syndrome known as larval cyathostominosis.  Resistance in small strongyles is now very common, with reports of resistance to all three of the currently available deworming drug classes.  Parasitologists have been urging horse owners to move away from strictly calendar-based worming to a targeted program based on surveillance.  Current recommendations centre around using fecal egg counts to identify high egg shedders for dosing.  “But, virtually nothing is known about the effectiveness of these recommendations, nor their applicability to different climatic regions, making it challenging to tailor sustainable recommendations for equine parasite control,” the researchers said in their paper.  In their study, they developed a computer model able to replicate the dynamics of the life stages of small strongyles both on pasture and in the host.  Nielsen described the years of work required to generate the model.  “We started by reading through all available literature about the biology, life-cycle, host immune responses, and mechanisms of drug resistance. That was a huge effort.  “Then, we started drawing the outline of the model. We looked at every stage of the life-cycle and defined how it would develop to the next stage. We took into account factors affecting the speed of development, and estimated the proportion of parasites that would successfully make it to the next stage.  “For the external stages – eggs and larvae on pasture – we designed the model to take into account temperature and precipitation with data obtained from weather stations. We then validated the model against published data to check if the worm numbers were realistic.  Finally, the model incorporated known genetics related to wormer resistance.  The researchers input weather data representing four different climatic zones: a cold humid continental climate (Dickinson, North Dakota), a temperate oceanic climate (Muencheberg, Germany), a cold semi-arid climate (Pecos, Texas), and a humid subtropical climate (St Leo, Florida).  They were able to track the likely path of resistance over 40 computer-generated years, evaluating the effects of climate and seasonality on resistance development.  The study team was also able to evaluate the impact of recommended selective drenching programs on delaying resistance development.  The scientists found that, based on the computer analysis, the month of treatment had a major impact on long-term resistance development in colder climates, but not so in a humid subtropical climate.  Increasing the frequency of treatment was found to increase resistance development in all climates, while moving from six to four treatments a year resulted in only a minor reduction in resistance development.  “However, the results also indicated that reducing the number of annual treatments from six to four, while continuing to treat all horses, is likely to have only a minimal benefit in slowing resistance development.  “Currently, many horse owners are struggling to achieve even this modest level of reduction in the number of treatments administered.  “To achieve significant gains in slowing resistance development, the model indicated that a number of annual treatments as low as two may be necessary if all horses are still to be treated on every occasion,” they reported.  Turning to their climate findings, the researchers said that, at low treatment frequencies, it appeared that the month became an important consideration in certain climates.  The timing of even just one treatment had a large impact on the development of resistance in the three evaluated seasonal climates. Resistance was generally slower to develop when treatments were given in winter or early spring.  These periods coincided with low rates of development of eggs to infective third-stage larvae on pasture, suggesting that worms surviving treatment at these times make a smaller contribution to subsequent pasture contamination.  In contrast, in a subtropical climate offering year-round favourable conditions for small strongyles, the time of the year had limited, if any, effect on the rate of resistance development.  “This could be because of a less synchronized pattern with adult parasites establishing and being replaced over the course of the entire year.”  Regardless of the mechanism, the modeling indicated that, in some climates, the timing of treatments may be important in reducing the rate of resistance development.  A combination of one or two strategic treatments given to all horses and one or two selective treatments given only to horses with higher eggs counts had vastly different outcomes, depending on whether all horses were treated in April in each of the selected climatic region or only selectively treated.  In the three seasonal climates used in the modeling, resistance development was substantially delayed when selective treatments were given in spring, compared to the scenarios where all horses were treated in April.  Treatments given early in the parasite transmission season will have a big impact on resistance development as surviving worms will live through the entire grazing season and contaminate the environment with resistant genes, they said.  “This suggests that selective therapy should be encouraged for spring treatments, whereas strategic treatments (administered to all horses) appear better suited for autumn treatments, where pasture contamination by the end of the grazing season is declining and adult worm burdens are approaching the end of their life span.”  The model suggests that treating all horses twice a year offered a marked reduction in the rate of resistance development compared to treating horses four or six times a year, but the timing of these two treatments in relation to climate is important.  Nielsen, who continued work on the project during his sabbatical in New Zealand last year, says it will also serve as an excellent tool to highlight knowledge gaps and identify research needs.  The researchers have just published another paper describing the model, and one centering on the genetics has just been accepted for publication.  Sauermann and Leathwick are from AgResearch Grasslands in Palmerston North, New Zealand. Leathwick conceptualized the model, acquired the first funding and administered the project. Sauermann organized the model and ran all simulations. Nielsen supervised the project.  The effect of climate, season, and treatment intensity on anthelmintic resistance in cyathostomins: A modelling exercise

# Latest opinion polls show conflicting results for main parties

Two opinion polls show conflicting levels of support for the main parties. One says Fianna Fáil is now more popular than Fine Gael - with another having the government party 10 points ahead of their rivals. The two polls released this evening show completely different results for the main parties as the Dáil breaks for Easter. The Sunday Times/Behaviour and Attitudes poll has Fianna Fáil jumping four points to 29% support and overtaking Fine Gael - which is down three to 28%. But the Red C poll for the Sunday Business Post has Fine Gael up two to 33% support - a full 10 points clear of Fianna Fáil which is down two. The polls also disagree on the level of support for Sinn Féin B&A has Mary Lou McDonald's Party up two to 21% - while it is up one to 14% in the Red C poll. The mixed results reflect what a lot of politicians still think - that we don't really know the shape of the leading parties. They may also pour more cold water on the chances of an imminent general election - because while every party can take something good from these polls, there's something bad in there for everyone as well.<|im_end|>

# Ken Paxton Puts the Brakes on Federal Inquiry Into Debunked Voter Fraud Claims

Ken Paxton Puts the Brakes on Federal Inquiry Into Debunked Voter Fraud Claims  A.G. tells Congress to wait in line  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office is flipping the bureaucratic bird to a congressional committee seeking to investigate the state's bungled attempt to purge thousands of voters from the rolls. Last month, the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform launched an inquiry into Secretary of State David Whitley's now-debunked claim that nearly 100,000 registered voters may not be citizens. In response to the committee's request for documents and communications between the SoS and the A.G.'s office, the latter is arguing that Congress has no "oversight jurisdiction" over constitutional officers in Texas, and its request is not tantamount to a subpoena. Instead, the A.G. will handle the federal inquiry as a Texas Public Information Act request, conveniently granting the office wide power over what it shares or withholds. First Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Mateer wrote that because of "pending litigation and ongoing criminal investigations," the A.G.'s office believes the info the committee is requesting is exempt from required disclosure under Texas law.  While nonexistent in reality, the voter fraud narrative was played hard by Mateer in his defiant rebuke. "We appreciate the Committee's interest in the OAG's efforts to protect the sanctity of elections in Texas, to promote lawful voting, and to prosecute illegal voting," wrote Mateer. "Notwithstanding political rhetoric to the contrary, our office has real, first-person experience showing the threat to election integrity in Texas is real. ... We look forward to any assistance and cooperation the Committee can provide in this endeavor."<|im_end|>

# Congress fields Sheila Dikshit from North East Delhi seat, Maken gets New Delhi

New Delhi: Congress on Monday announced a list of its six candidates who will contest Lok Sabha election 2019 from Delhi with former CM Sheila Dikshit being named from the North East Delhi parliamentary seat.  Dikshit will face off against BJP's Manoj Tiwari and AAP's Dilip Pandey while senior Congress leader Ajay Maken will contest from New Delhi Lok Sabha seat against AAP's Brijesh Goyal. While Maken had finished a distant third from the same seat in 2014 Lok Sabha election, Dikshit had not contested because she was the Governor of Kerala at the time.  The other candidates from the party in Delhi are JP Agarwal (Chandni Chowk), Arvinder Singh Lovely (East Delhi), Rajesh Lilothia (North West Delhi) and Mahabal Mishra (West Delhi). No candidate has yet been named from the South Delhi seat.  With this, the total number of candidates named by Congress for Lok Sabha election 2019 stands at 419.  Over the course of the past several weeks, Congress was involved in talks with AAP over a possible seat-sharing arrangement in Delhi. However, AAP refused to give up seats in Delhi after Congress took a strong stand against a seat-sharing formula in Haryana. AAP would later say that giving up seats in Delhi to Congress was the same as giving up seats to BJP, a party that both AAP and Congress are looking to bring down. (Click here for full report)  All seven parliamentary constituencies in Delhi will vote in the sixth phase on May 12.<|im_end|>

# Deepika Padukone wraps up Delhi schedule of her upcoming Chhapaak

Deepika Padukone wraps up Delhi schedule of her upcoming Chhapaak  In order to mark the wrap of Chhapaak, Meghna Gulzar shared an adorable picture with Deepika Padukone and the entire team  Meghna Gulzar's directorial Chhapaak, which is creating an uproar across quarters for its relevant narrative, is based on the true story of an acid attack survivor, Laxmi Agarwal. The film has recently wrapped up its Delhi schedule. In order to mark the wrap, the director shared an adorable picture with Deepika Padukone and the entire team. The film features Deepika Padukone alongside Vikrant Massey.  Ever since the announcement of Deepika Padukone slipping into the character of an acid attack survivor broke, the film has already generated headlines all over. The reason being that instead of choosing a glamorous role, the leading lady of Bollywood is playing a character which challenges the notion of beauty amongst masses.  Sharing the picture on her social media handle, Meghna Gulzar wrote, "Happily halfway done! Delhi schedule wrap for team #chhapaak @deepikapadukone@vikrantmassey87 @foxstarhindi"  The film demands Deepika Padukone to live the life of an acid attack survivor touching upon all the adversities and the victories the survivor experiences. Deepika will be portraying the character of Malti in the film.  Chhapaak, which highlights the life of an acid attack survivor, puts forth the confidence of the survivor to be taken as inspiration for those who have faced a similar situation. Helmed by Meghna Gulzar, the film is all set to release on January 10, 2020.    Deepika Padukone spotted shooting for Chhapaak in Delhi!<|im_end|>

# The Yorkshire Post says: Last orders for more of our pubs unless leniency over business rates

EVEN THOUGH the warm weather has left pub gardens overflowing across Yorkshire, it may not be sufficient to prevent last orders being called – for good – at those hostelries which are struggling to make financial ends meet.  Warnings earlier this month about how exorbitant business rates were forcing some pubs out of business have been further re-enforced today by confirmation that nearly 1,000 premises shut down last year. Not only is this devastating for those owners, and their staff, who had worked tirelessly against these financial odds, but each and every closure is another lost amenity which only serves to devalue communities. Given this, it is surely in the Government’s best interests for the Treasury to show leniency towards those licensed premises that are genuinely supportive of community and social groups. As this newspaper has said previously, it would be a false economy not to serve these pubs.<|im_end|>

# China criticizes US effort to reduce Iran oil sales

BEIJING (AP) — China has criticized Washington's decision to tell Beijing and other governments to stop buying Iranian oil or face sanctions.  A foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said Monday that Chinese dealings with Iran are "reasonable and legitimate, which thus deserves respect."  U.S. officials told reporters the Trump administration will inform other governments they no longer will be exempt from sanctions. China is one of the biggest foreign buyers of Iranian crude.  Geng said Beijing opposes Washington's "unilateral sanctions and long-armed jurisdiction." However, Geng gave no indication what Beijing might do if Washington went ahead with sanctions against China.<|im_end|>

# Vehicle views can offer variety and opportunity

If you are like me, you spend a portion of your day in your vehicle. There are days when I am driving that seem to never end. However, I always try to make the most of my time in the car traveling around South Jersey. Some days, I listen to music, and other days, talk radio. Regardless of what I am hearing or seeing, I sometimes find myself mentally preparing for what is coming up or reflecting on what has transpired during the work day. Most days, my reflective time produces creative thoughts. Many of these thoughts are new ideas and concepts. But what is it about the time in the car and during my commute that fuels my engine of creativity? I have multiple routes I can choose during my travels from town to town. My drive and the path I choose to take can, and usually does, match my mood. If I am feeling structured and organized, I will choose a direct route to work. Feeling a little more relaxed, I will opt for a longer, winding road. Wanting, or better yet longing, for a day at the beach, I choose the coast. When I feel I may be taking what I have for granted, I take routes most people avoid. Some streets and roads reflect reality. Sometimes, we all need to be reminded of the realities around us. While we all have challenges and struggles, some people have challenges and struggles much greater than our own. Some of my best ideas are created in the car. It may sound strange, but the sights and the sounds that surround me when I drive make me feel more creative in the way I think. It also helps me be more creative in developing new ideas. Perhaps it goes back to the variety of what I see in my commute. Or it could be that the pockets of business districts and shops that seem to spring up between residential areas that get me thinking. Maybe it is because a new business or store always seems to catch my eye. I check out the look of the new business, a new sign or logo. Sometimes I find myself asking questions like “How did they do that?” or “Why did they do that?” Whatever the reasons, they got creative and started a business. And for some reason, seeing all the creativity makes me feel more creative, too. The creativity of the commute does not always center around coming up with new ideas. I sometimes tend to solve problems and work out difficult situations while driving. I find it interesting that the time in which I am most likely to literally run into roadblocks is where I am most likely to find solutions to roadblocks I may be facing outside of the car. I hope you all have similar experiences when it comes to travel around our region. We all need a vehicle to get us where we want to go. The time may be right for you to embrace a more creative commute.<|im_end|>

# Hoffman welcomed as new Sports Editor

Hoffman welcomed as new Sports Editor  The Post & Mail has welcomed Joe Hoffman as the new Sports Editor. Hoffman grew up in Churubusco, graduating from Churubusco High School. He said he developed a love for writing at an early age, writing for the local paper. 
“I did a middle school news section and that piqued my interest in writing,” Hoffman said. 
After high school Hoffman first took classes for mechanical engineering through Indiana State University. While taking a psychology course though, he found he had a passion for the subject and transferred to Indiana Tech where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. 
He joined the graduate counseling program at Huntington University in the summer of last year. Hoffman said it has been through his college career that he found that love for writing again, just like he did when he was younger. 
“As kids mom took us the library a lot and I just loved what I read. I found it sparked creativity and it made me want to express my creativity as well.” 
Hoffman has worked with The Post & Mail for approximately three years, and started sharing his passion for writing last year when he began covering Whitley County sports and other events for the paper. 
“Once I saw my work in print it made me realize it was something I could be successful at so I applied when the sports editor position became available,” Hoffman said. 
He said he has always enjoyed watching sports, and says he is excited to translate into news coverage. “I love the competition and when I got the chance to be a stringer I had an interest in translating what I was seeing into words,” he said. 
It is this passion for writing Hoffman said he hopes to continue to show as the sports editor. “I look forward to being able to be creatively writing as a professional,” he said. “It’s  now going to be something I do everyday.” 
Hoffman said he is also excited to focus on local sports and the hard work each school and team puts in. 
“Local sports is a big deal for our county. We take a lot of pride in our sports, and our athletes compete hard,” Hoffman said. “(As a correspondent) I was able to see the pride the kids had and see how much the coaches care and that’s inspiring.” 
In his spare time, Hoffman said he likes to read, particularly the classics and mysteries, and he loves to spend time with his family. He is supported by his wife Renae and his three kids.<|im_end|>

# Masters tournament to offset winter weather blues

T.S. Eliotopened his famous poem "The Waste Land" in 1922 with this famous line: “April is the cruellest (sic) month, breeding lilacs out of the dead land, mixing memory and desire, stirring dull roots with spring rain.” For Minnesotans, January, February and March were also cruel, as evidenced by a polar vortex, record snowfall and a merciless number of days with bitterly cold temperatures. However, for hardy Central Minnesota golfers, April is the time to put this wild and wacky winter behind and look forward to today’s start of the Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia. In the tundra of Minnesota, golf unofficially starts with viewing the Masters. For me, two scenarios will be the most intriguing. Will Tiger Woods win his 15th major, or will Rory McIlroy complete the career Grand Slam? In the meantime, the temperature in Central Minnesota for Thursday is predicted to be in the 30s with the possibility of 12-18 inches of snow. To play this week is iffy, so vicarious golf via television is your best bet as ESPN will cover the first two rounds and CBS will pick up weekend rounds. For Minnesota golfers, April is truly the cruelest month. Golf Notes: In December I attended the 17th annual Media Classic coordinated by Bill Huffman. We had the opportunity to play four Phoenix-area courses: Mountain Shadows, Papago Golf Course, Wickenburg Ranch Golf Club and the grand re-opening of The Phoenician. All were worth playing on the trip. What struck me most memorably was the new state-of-the-art practice facility for the Arizona State University (ASU) golf teams at Papago Golf Club. Alumnus Phil Mickelson and his wife Amy contributed $1 million to complete the facility in November. It’s a practice facility that rivals anything in collegiate golf. It should help ASU compete for an NCAA championship. Here is a video about the facility: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nDsTIRBcaRg#. Minnesota will host two professional golf events this summer. On June 18-23, the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship will be contested at historic Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska. Started in 1955, this event is one of the LPGA’s five majors. The inaugural 3M Open will be contested July 4-7 at the TPC in Blaine. This event replaces the popular senior event and has already received commitments from four top-20 tour stars including Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed, Jason Day and Bryson DeChambeau. To purchase tickets, visit: www.3Mopen/com/Tickets, or to rub elbows with golf’s best, one can volunteer. Visit www.3MOpen.com/Volunteers. A recent statistic from the PGA Tour that surprised me was that professionals have a 50/50 chance of sinking putts from 7 feet. As is logical, the odds go up considerably from farther than 7 feet. No wonder PGA professionals work incessantly on their putting and short game. To me the most remarkable putting statistic was Tiger Woods’s mind-boggling record. He made 1,057 putts in a row from inside 3 feet on the PGA Tour. Territory Golf Club will be the site of the first Demo Day on Saturday, April 20, from noon to 4 p.m. All the latest gear from Mizuno, Callaway, Titleist, Cobra, Wilson and Cleveland/Srixon will be demonstrated. Moreover, local craft beer companies will supply sample libations. This is the opinion of Times golf columnist John Lieser. Contact him at Jgl1943@gmail.com<|im_end|>

# Who Will Call Out Joe Biden's Bullshit?

Bidenapalooza is due to start any day now, according to Axios. It’s Bidenmania, folks; everyone is preparing for Bidenmentum. Mike Allen, the site’s founder and a notorious hack, has a “scoop” this morning describing what Biden’s message will be. (I do not think you should be allowed to call a scoop anything that the campaign in question would clearly want to be public.) What is that message? What he’ll say: Biden will spell out the stakes for the country, and talk about what kind of people we’re going to be. He’ll emphasize the kind of politics he’s running against, and what kind of leadership the moment calls for. This is almost entirely meaningless. This is a description of what all campaign announcement speeches do. In many ways, it is a description of all political rhetoric. Mike Allen has published the Wikipedia page for “politics.” Advertisement Anyway, the important point is that Joe Biden is coming, bitches, and you all better be ready to saddle up and step aside for the anointed frontrunner. But, as the New York Times points out, there will be some challenges. First, getting into the race kind of late (April 2019 should not be late!) means he’s behind on money, and Biden is already “not previously known as a prolific fund-raiser.” According to the paper, Biden would have to raise “more than $100,000 every day until Christmas just to match” what Bernie Sanders had in the bank at the start of April. How is Biden going to make up this massive deficit against the candidate who’s been running slightly behind him in early polls? With big donor money. This presents another challenge, which the Times characterizes as “dueling imperatives” at a time when other candidates are swearing off big money entirely: The dueling imperatives were apparent in Mr. Biden’s activity in the last week. He rallied striking union workers near Boston on Thursday, proclaiming, “Wall Street bankers and C.E.O.s did not build America — you built America!” At the same time, he has been setting up calls with influential political contributors, according to a person familiar with his activity. Advertisement You could call this “dueling imperatives,” or you could call it being two-faced, or just lying. You might even say it’s more accurate to say that Joe Biden is telling striking workers he’s their friend while taking money from, and therefore being beholden to, the class of people oppressing them. According to Axios, Biden’s first fundraiser will be with David Cohen, the executive vice president of and principal lobbyist for Comcast. Comcast is one of America’s most hated companies, and for good reason. It represents everything that sucks for the modern consumer-citizen, for whom things like internet or TV access are extremely basic necessities, but who are usually given the option of purchasing it from just one or two companies. In many places, including in my apartment, Comcast is literally the only choice for internet service; in other areas of the country, another company dominates. If you don’t like your cable provider, you have to keep it anyway. They raise rates after an arbitrary point of time; they charge way too much to begin with. If you call to find out why your internet is out or your TV channels are disappearing, the customer service is terrible, and everyone who works for them is probably miserable, too, dealing with irate customers. Not for nothing, Comcast also supports many terrible policies that no one likes, including ending net neutrality and repealing broadband privacy protections. Not to mention, cable companies also generally treat their workers poorly. Advertisement Comcast sucks. Everyone hates Comcast. And Joe Biden is going to kick off his presidential campaign by begging for their money. This is not a “dueling imperative” with his pretense of worker solidarity. This is a betrayal of regular people, though no one expected anything different from him. And it’s not just going to be Comcast; it’s going to be hundreds of people who got rich off exploiting and underpaying their workers, or by investing in those companies and whose financial interests lie in those companies being able to continue to do that. Some of those donors, according to Biden, will literally be “major Republican folks.” This is not just a matter of hypocrisy. It is a fundamental decision about whose dollars and whose influence and whose interests will drive your campaign, and therefore your presidency. This is the question you’re answering when you choose to power your campaign with big donor money and not swear it off in favor of regular people: Who am I for? Advertisement Will anyone put it to him this way? Would anyone in the media who has a chance to interview Joe Biden actually ask him about the fundamental conflict between representing the interests of workers and taking money from the class that oppresses them? You might get a Chuck Todd asking him whether it’s Bad Optics to salute workers and take money from big donors at the same time, if you’re lucky. But it’s not just optics; it’s the whole ballgame.<|im_end|>

# Asus to launch Zenfone 6 on May 16

The 30-second teaser video shows the journey of the Zenfone smartphone series over the years and in the end, Asus says the Zenfone 6 would ‘defy ordinary’.  The Mobile World Conference (MWC) may have got over, but smartphone manufacturers are still teasing specifications or looks of their upcoming smartphones. Amongst them is Asus, which has announced the launch of its next flagship device— Asus Zenfone 6. Asus announced about the launch event on its Twitter handle. The 30-second teaser video shows the journey of the Zenfone smartphone series over the years and in the end, Asus says the Zenfone 6 would ‘defy ordinary’. — ASUS (@ASUS) February 25, 2019 Earlier, an advertisement of the flagship was spotted during the MWC 2019 which had an announcement date of May 14. The ad had a picture of the smartphone with no bezels or notch. The updated video teaser states that the Zenfone 6 would be launched on May 16. Based on the updates, it is speculated that Asus Zenfone 6 would have a slider design or pop-up camera if the company decides to ditch any kind of notch. No other details where provided. We can expect Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 to power the smartphone as the current flagship has the Snapdragon 845. The company has been successful in keeping the specs under wraps as there are no new rumours or leaks available online. However, some reports suggest that the device would have a 16:9 display without any cut-out or notch. A prototype of the Zenfone 6 made its way online that showed the same design as that of the Zenfone 5 and 5Z. The device is also said to feature a triple camera setup at the back and a home button on the front that would double as a fingerprint scanner. Other rumours suggested the Zenfone 6 would have a water-drop notch, which doesn’t match with the advertisement picture by Asus. The Zenfone 6 will be a successor to the current flagship device- The Zenfone 5Z. The 5z was launched in India for Rs 29,999. The current flagship has a 6.2-inch Full HD+ Super IPS+ display and a resolution of 1080*2246. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor paired with 6/8GB RAM and a dual camera setup with a 12 MP f/1.8 primary sensor and an 8 MP wide-angle sensor.<|im_end|>

# Little Mittens approved for non-farm use of ALR for wildlife rescue - BC Local News

Little Mittens Animal Rescue Association has been permitted non-farm use of Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) west of Golden.  With the approval, Little Mittens can now build their wildlife rescue centre, using temporary structures and enclosures for all of the wild animals they will bring in. This includes building a deer enclosure, an area for aviation birds, water fowl, and more.  The land belongs to Ron and Nancy Watson, who use the agricultural land for farming use. The section Little Mittens will occupy is unused land by the owners.  “They are huge animal lovers. They don’t use it, and they want us to use it,” said Little Mittens founder and executive director Alannah Knapp.  It has been almost an entire year since Little Mittens applied for full exclusion use of the ALR, and they were finally permitted to use the land for non-farm use. After applying for the full exclusion, the application had to go to town council, who then went to inspect the property.  The piece of land is perfect for everything Little Mittens wants to use it for, Knapp said.  “There’s little parts of the Columbia River that come onto it,” she said, adding that the additional water coming onto the property will prove advantageous for the animals they rescue.  The property provides a natural landscape that is suitable for housing animals while they recover, before they are released back into the wild.  “It’s a wildlife corridor that runs through there,” Knapp said.  Now, Little Mittens will work to get funds they need and supplies to build the enclosures and a dwelling on the property.  They will be looking for monetary donations, building materials, and help with building.  “We want to put some sort of dwelling unit on it… We have volunteers that could sleep in a trailer,” Knapp said.  The animal rescue will also have to bring power in to the area to provide lights at night and warm the dwelling if needed.  The frozen ground provides some time before Little Mittens will officially begin their work on the land.  “We’ll have to wait until the ground thaws in the spring,” Knapp said.  Follow Little Mittens Animal Rescue on Facebook to keep updated about their progress and all of the adoptable animals they have, or visit www.littlemittens.org to donate.<|im_end|>

# Le Wagon launches part-time coding bootcamps – TechCrunch

Le Wagon has been steadily growing for the past few years. The bootstrapped French company now has 34 campuses across 22 countries. And now, Le Wagon is about to welcome a whole lot more students thanks to a new part-time program.  The startup has been testing a new part-time format in London and now wants to expand this program across all campuses. This way, students can keep working in their existing company and attend Le Wagon on Tuesday night, Thursday night and Saturday.  Le Wagon still focuses on its highly rated full-stack program. So far, nearly 5,000 students have attended this 9-week full-time bootcamp. You get to learn about front-end and back-end development, and you end up building your own project from start to finish.  After a couple of months, you should be ready to start a startup or join a startup as a software engineer. And Le Wagon is still scaling that program as the company expects to accept between 2,000 and 3,000 students in 2019 alone.  The part-time program has the exact same content and costs the same price — the full-time program in Paris currently costs €6,900. The part-time program is going live in Paris in August, and it should be live on most campuses by January 2020. And the company thinks a part-time program opens up many different possibilities.  If you have a family and kids, maybe you can’t afford to leave your job or take a sabbatical. Some high-ranked executives also want to be 100 percent sure they want to start a new career before leaving everything behind. According to Le Wagon co-founder and COO Romain Paillard, the new program should attract different profiles, which should improve the depth of the alumni community.  Many former students create their own startups. French startups founded by Le Wagon alumni have raised $48 million (€43 million) in total.  Of course, it’ll take a lot of motivation to go through the program. It’s like signing up for a part-time job in addition to your full-time job. Le Wagon will screen candidates as much as possible to see if they’re motivated enough to finish the program.  Many companies don’t want to let their employees attend Le Wagon right now because it means they’ll be gone for a couple of months. Le Wagon thinks companies will be more open-minded about a part-time program and support their employees.  This will be a nice addition to Le Wagon’s executive program. The company is just starting on this front and has attracted hundreds of employees working for big companies and looking for a short program to learn new skills.<|im_end|>

# Wirral Met shortlisted for ECHO Environment Award

Wirral Met College has been shortlisted for this year’s Liverpool ECHO Environment Awards, in the award category “Carbon Champion”, sponsored by The Mersey Forest.  Wirral Met was named an award finalist for creating an innovative, low-carbon “Micro-turbine Hybrid Energy Centre”, at its Twelve Quays Campus.  Highly efficient gas-powered micro-turbines now produce 80% of the campus’ electrical demand, minimising the need for electrical power from the grid.  The system uses phase-change thermal mass blocks with the turbines’ heat output to provide domestic hot water and heating for the entire campus.  Electrical storage batteries further reduce the campus’ energy demand by smoothing the electrical energy curve, reducing peak demand.  Carbon output is reduced by 200 tonnes pa and energy costs are predicted to reduce by £80,000 pa.  This is the first time anywhere in the world where this combination of technologies has been employed and has already exceeded expectations.  The Liverpool ECHO Environment Awards recognise the best environmental businesses, schools, community projects and individuals to thank those who are making a difference and celebrate their magnificent achievements in Merseyside and beyond.  The awards ceremony takes place on Thursday, May 2.  For information about Wirral Met, or for advice and guidance on courses to suit your needs, visit wmc.ac.uk or call 0151 551 7777.<|im_end|>

# Tribute to ‘great citizen’ Penny Sinclair of Kirkintilloch

Gordon Carmichael of Kirkintilloch Community Council pays tribute to well known community activist Penny Sinclair, who passed away earlier this year.  “Over many generations the town of Kirkintilloch has been blessed to have many active citizens in her midst, people who strive to enhance the area for the benefit of others in their community. Of course, many of these fine people are no longer with us today. Added to that list should be the name of Penny Sinclair, who sadly passed away earlier this year. Penny was a ‘well-kent face’ in Kirkintilloch and was for many years seen walking through the town, taking note of progress and keeping a keen eye on developmental changes, particularly those which restricted access, or which might contravene Planning Regulations. Recognisable yes, well known of course, but who was Penny Sinclair? Penny was born in 1933 in the municipality of the British Consulate General at Tientsin, an industrial town (now Tianjin) in the North East of China. Her family returned to this country in 1937 and moved to Dalry in 1940 where Penny attended Dalry High School. Her further education was at Glasgow Commercial College and her studies led to a successful career in Secretarial Studies, securing a position at United Biscuits (formerly MacDonald and Sons) where she remained until 1969. Her youth involved looking after her Pony named Spectre, and Penny enjoyed trekking in the Ayrshire countryside and may even have participated in local hunts. Her love of the countryside and accessibility would remain significant to her throughout her life. Penny married John (Sinclair) in 1967 and had a daughter Heather who with her husband Mike provided Penny’s two grandchildren Oscar and Charlotte. As a young woman, Penny enjoyed and participated in various Dancing Competitions and gained success in both Amateur Ballroom and Latin American classes, both requiring her lightness of foot. Penny thoroughly enjoyed working in her garden at her house in Hayston and valued social engagements with her neighbours. Penny also enjoyed travel and visited unusual places throughout her life and often these including walking adventures. Foreign visits took her to Majorca, Paris, Reykjavik in Iceland and Bergen in Norway. She enjoyed many canal holidays throughout her life and often walked the towpaths beside the canals. She would later enjoy the work of the Seagull Trust. In later life, she regaled in telling people she was embarking on a walking adventure and when her visitor or listener enquired as to where, she would surprise them by explaining she had secured the support of the British Forces - to visit the Falklands! Yes, she visited there in 2010 and was able to return in 2012, despite her occasional reduced ability to walk in Cowgate! These were remarkable accomplishments, particularly at 77 and 79 years of age. Penny was extremely active in her own community and made herself known to anyone she thought she might gain information or support from. She was resolute in her robust defence of free access, and she often found cause to remonstrate with Local Officers charged with responsibility for planning. Her attendance at local meetings of whatever form or association often resulted in her formidable contribution and was frequently met with a ‘gasp of exasperation’. Nonetheless she seldom left such a forum without being thanked for making an invaluable contribution to the discussions, and often leading to positive actions elsewhere. Penny’s love of walking drew her to the values of the accreditation of Walkers are Welcome and she travelled to many places in Scotland and further afield to make enquiries with the association as to how Kirkintilloch might achieve such status. Never daunted by the lack of immediate support or funds, Penny displayed a tenacious spirit that most officials of authority had neither the energy or expertise to refute. Penny used this same approach to ensure the Canal Footpaths (former towpaths) were appropriately surfaced on the approaches to the town to increase and enhance the experience of those encouraged to utilise these country routes. She also secured funds from the ‘Big Lottery Fund’s Awards for All’ to widen the right of way – which runs from the ‘Campsie View estate’ to the ‘Forth and Clyde Canal’ towpath and was successful in raising funds for similar projects. Similarly she cared for the well-being of nature in our area and repeatedly reported on the health of the Swans on the canal. During repair work and upgrades being carried out, Penny was exhaustive in her monitoring of the standards being exercised by workmen and authority representatives. A keen walker, Penny joined the Strathkelvin Ramblers in 1998 and became their Social Secretary in 2001. She held the appointment of Planning Convenor of Kirkintilloch Community Council for several years and regularly updated her colleagues on matters. There was little point in contradicting or trying to correct Penny. She was astute in her practice of pretending not to be aware, or understanding of what was being said. She was also comfortable in any environment, but happiest perhaps enjoying the fresh air of the countryside. A regular visitor to several of the premises in town, particularly the Kirky Puffer, where she was made welcome and looked after by many kind friends. Supporting the work of the East Dunbartonshire Visually Impaired Peoples Forum ( E.D.V.I.P.) was important to her, especially in relation to the local & national campaigning against the “Shared Space Scheme”. She handed out leaflets and attended Council meetings, as they discussed the new Scheme being installed in Kirkintilloch. On learning the public were restricted from taking posters in to Council meetings, Penny in her own inimitable style, simply pinned a poster onto her T- shirt, concealed underneath her jacket, which she proudly revealed to all once inside! Penny also attended when their Petition was presented to the Scottish Parliament against Shared Space Schemes in Scotland. Penny supported the belief this excluded many from town centres and that those who were visually impaired felt excluded. She was keen to see the loss of safe access to the town centre being challenged. Seldom today do we hear the description of ‘indefatigable’ being apportioned to a person with fondness or respect, but in the case of Penny Sinclair, it certainly seems most appropriate. Or, as a good friend from her days in The Ramblers described her, Penny Sinclair was “simply a Great Citizen.” Like so many before her, Penny Sinclair played her part in supporting our community and ensuring that when we seek to enjoy our environment, it is accessible and we can do so unrestricted. Neither Penny, nor the part she played, should be quickly forgotten, for she will never be replaced.”<|im_end|>

# Cartoonist Surprised By Reaction To Racist Wilson-Raybould Caricature

OTTAWA — A Journal de Montreal cartoonist says he's sorry for offending anyone with his racist depiction of Jody Wilson-Raybould. Veteran cartoonist Yannick Lemay explained in a statement Friday that it wasn't his intention to be offensive or offside. "I am surprised by this reaction," he told HuffPost Canada in French. "I wanted a simple design here, nothing else." The cartoon shows Wilson-Raybould, Canada first Indigenous justice minister and attorney general, wearing a beaded leather-fringed outfit and feathers in her hair. The depiction is an antiquated and offensive visual shorthand to convey her Indigenous identity. She is carrying a double-bladed hatchet in one hand and, with the other, delivers a knockout punch to a cartoon Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Watch: Liberal MP apologizes for comments made about Wilson-Raybould  Tying in a reference to the SNC-Lavalin controversy, Trudeau is illustrated wearing boxing headgear with "PLC-Lavalin" emblazoned across the front. A joint is seemingly knocked from his mouth as well. "PLC" is the abbreviation for the Liberal Party of Canada in French. University of Ottawa law professor Errol Mendes was among those who criticized Journal de Montreal for publishing the cartoon.  This cartoon is appalling, racist and not worthy of being part of a respectable newspaper in Canada. — Errol Mendes (@3mendous) March 1, 2019  And a hearty Anishinaabe fuck you to @JdeMontreal for their piss-poor attempt at an editorial cartoon today. — Walking Eagle News (@TheEagleist) March 1, 2019 Lemay said he's drawing lessons from the backlash, which was published Thursday online and in print. There are "more and more subjects" for which cartoonists need to be prudent about, he said. "I'm sorry if I offended certain people." The cartoon remains up on the newspaper's website. The SNC-Lavalin controversy has embroiled the Liberal government in recent weeks, which has prompted cartoonists across the country to sketch their take on the day's news. Some have landed themselves in trouble for insensitive depictions of both Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau. Toronto Star cartoonist Theo Moudakis deleted a cartoon Thursday showing the prime minister taking a walk in the snow in the path of an avalanche labelled "2019 election." Trudeau's youngest brother Michel was killed in an avalanche in 1998. Moudakis apologized to the prime minister for the "thoughtless oversight."  I've deleted tomorrow's cartoon and it won't be running in the Star. It was a thoughtless oversight, my apologies to the PM. — Theo Moudakis (@TheoMoudakis) February 28, 2019 Halifax-based political cartoonist Michael de Adder apologized last month for his drawing of the former attorney general. In the depiction, Wilson-Raybould is shown seated on a chair in a boxing ring with her hands tied and mouth taped. Over the other corner, Trudeau is being coached by his former principal secretary Gerry Butts to "keep beating her up, solicitor-client privilege has tied her hands." The cartoon was widely panned for condoning violence against women, insensitive to the fact that the Indigenous women are more likely to be targets of violence than other women and girls.

# Shikellamy interviewing candidates for a district superintendent

SUNBURY– More than a half-dozen people are interested in being Shikellamy’s new superintendent. The seven candidates have emerged for the vacant spot previously occupied by Brett Misavage, who said he would not return to work due to health reasons. Misavage was already on a health sabbatical at the time.    Interim Superintendent Dr. Thomas Schlovin tells us, “We have, at this point, seven applications for the superintendencey. And we still have two weeks to go for the deadline, and I’m pleased with the quality of candidates we’re getting. And so, we’re going to look through those and try to narrow the field down a little bit, then get the staff and the board, and I like to even get students involved in the interviewing process.”    Dr. Schlovin said he will question candidates to see if their strengths match the needs of the district, “I will question the candidates, I’m meeting with one on Thursday, as a matter of fact, on what they feel their strengths are, and do they match up with what the needs of the district are. And there are some people that don’t have the superintendent’s experience, but they have strong experience at being a building principal, and those type of things. But we do have four or five that are currently superintendents that are interested in coming here, so that’s a good sign.”    Dr. Schlovin also says he expects the district will now be able to announce the new superintendent by the end of April, or early May…this after having an original goal to have the hire in place by July.<|im_end|>

# Groups to honor Civil War vets

WATERLOO — The Cedar Valley Roundtable and Iowa Sons of Union Veterans are working together to place special markers for the last Civil War veterans to die in Black Hawk and Bremer counties. The late Henry Bray, of Black Hawk County, who is buried in Elmwood Cemetery, will be honored at 10 a.m. Saturday. His great-niece, Mary Yetter, will attend. Martin Stebbins of Bremer County is buried at Harlington Cemetery. His program will be at 1 p.m. “We’re hoping for good weather,” said Jim Petersen of the Cedar Valley Roundtable. The event is to remind people of the sacrifices made by Americans during the Civil War and the reasons it was fought, Petersen said. “These men volunteered to serve,” Petersen said. Similar events will take place in all 99 Iowa counties. “It takes time to get everything organized,” said Jo Porter, of the Cedar Valley Roundtable. “Both of these men were quite young when they enlisted.” Bray was 17 and Martin was 18, and they both endured a lot of hardships, Porter said. “They marched 10,000 miles.” Near the end of the war Bray ended up near Pensacola, Fla. “A private made $13 a month,” Petersen said. “The life expectancy of person back then was about 55.” Bray was born Feb. 25, 1844, in Illinois. He trained for the war in Kentucky and participated in the siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi. At least 10 years after the war Bray relocated to the Quasqueton area and worked as laborer and owned a tavern. Around 1900, he moved to Waterloo and became a barber. He was featured in several Courier articles after 1937 and participated in Waterloo Memorial Day events every year. He died in 1943, having lived to hear of four major American military conflicts. He was one of the oldest Civil War veterans. There will be a color guard made up of ROTC students from East and West High schools at both programs.<|im_end|>

# Chhota Rajan's henchman, 14 others camp in Maharashtra's Sindhudurg, banished as polling begins

MUMBAI: A close aide of jailed underworld don Chhota Rajan and 13 others have been asked to leave the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency in coastal Maharashtra where polling is underway.  Nilesh Paradkar, an alleged henchman of the don and his aides were camping in Sindhudurg during the poll campaigning, according to police said.  Photographs of Paradkar purportedly sharing a stage with Maharashtra Minister of State (Home) Deepak Kesarkar and Shiv Sena-BJP alliance candidate Vinayak Raut were circulated on the social media.  Acting on a tipoff, police raided a hotel in Kankavli and detained Paradkar and his aides, the official said, adding, he has many cases registered against him in Mumbai.  "The 14 persons were asked to leave the (Lok Sabha) constituency as they are not local residents. They do not have any criminal record in Sindhudurg. Nothing suspicious was found against them during questioning," said Dixit Gedam, Superintendent of Police.<|im_end|>

# He built a good life. It was ended by a suicidal driver who veered into Miami traffic, cops say

Suicidal driver kills Miami patriarch  William Escorcia came to Miami from Nicaragua in the 1980s with just $800 in his pocket. After working various jobs, he founded a small electrical contracting company that flourished. That success allowed him and his wife to buy a home in West Kendall, where they raised three children, all of whom went on to graduate from college.  But that thriving family was shattered in September when a woman named Anca Cristescu, police say, suddenly veered her car into oncoming traffic, hitting Escorcia’s car as he drove to his weekly golf outing.  Cristescu, 38, was not drunk or texting. Instead, Cristescu told officers “she wanted to die” and may have accelerated into oncoming traffic on Southwest 157th Avenue in West Kendall “in an attempt to end her own life,” according to an arrest warrant. Escorcia, 63, was killed in the wreck.  Miami-Dade prosecutors this week formally charged Cristescu, who remained jailed Tuesday on a charge of vehicular manslaughter. A native of Romania, she will be allowed to stay on house arrest with an electronic GPS ankle monitor while awaiting trial.  Cristecu appeared in court for arraignment on Monday, as her lawyer entered a plea of not guilty. Escorcia’s grief-stricken family watched from the gallery.  “I feel like my light went off because of what happened to him. I miss him every day. He was the light of the house,” said Maria Escorcia, his wife of 40 years. Escorcia was born and raised in Nicaragua, where he was a member of the national volleyball team in the mid-1970s. He also earned a degree in electrical engineering. He and his wife, Maria, emigrated to the United States in the mid-1980s as Nicaragua was wracked by political unrest.  In South Florida, Escorcia started out small. He worked first as a gas-station attendant, then did construction jobs. Finally, in 1996, he established his own electrical company, WEA Electrical, starting with one work desk in the corner of his bedroom. As the company began to do electrical wiring work across South Florida, including for many schools and office buildings, it expanded to 37 employees.  His three children in Miami: Elsa Escorcia, 41, Julio Escorcia, 36, and Emily Escorcia, 26. All three graduated from college. “He was so proud. He felt like his life’s dream had been accomplished,” Maria Escorcia said.  Wiliam Escorcia, his family said, had boundless energy — he loved tending to his garden, reading biographies, and working out at the gym. He also picked up golf about five years ago and quickly became addicted, golfing twice a week.  The crash happened on Sept. 1. Escorcia had just had breakfast. Just after 7 a.m., Escorcia left his house to drive to the Redland Golf and Country Club, where he was to play his usual round with friends.  He drove his Mazda CX9 up Southwest 157th Avenue around 28th Street, a two-lane stretch of road in a residential neighborhood.  That’s when Cristescu, driving a blue Chevrolet Sonic, veered her car “directly into the path of oncoming traffic” and Escorcia’s car, according to the arrest warrant. Escorcia’s Mazda smashed into a guard rail and rolled over. Cristescu’s Chevy hit a concrete wall.  Miami-Dade police officers rushed to the crash scene. As they tried to help her, “she became irate and began screaming that she wanted to die,” according to the warrant by Miami-Dade Detective Jonathan Mesa.  Cristescu repeated it to a Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue paramedic, saying “she accelerated into the other lane of traffic,” the warrant said. Although she was not hurt physically, Cristescu was hospitalized because of her “erratic” behavior. She was not immediately arrested.  Toxicology tests showed she was not on any drugs or alcohol. But an analysis of her car’s computer “black box” revealed she was driving at 68 miles per hour just two seconds before the impact with Escorcia’s car — nearly twice the posted speed limit.  Cristescu, accompanied by her lawyer, later spoke to police and denied she had any medical or psychiatric issues before the crash. “She drove with a willful and wanton disregard for other persons or property, and as a result, the victim was killed,” Mesa wrote.  She lived near the crash scene. Little was known about Cristescu’s life or what may have driven her to the cusp of suicide. Her attorney was not available for comment on Tuesday.  Since the crash, Escorcia’s family has struggled to grasp why Cristescu took the family patriarch in an apparent botched suicide.  So have others. Over 500 people showed up to the funeral, according to the family.  Said Maria Escorcia: “I was so surprised to see so many people who loved him, to see how much of an impact he had on the lives of others.”<|im_end|>

# Dead or Alive 6 Review

Game: Dead or Alive 6 Consoles: PS4 (reviewed), Xbox One, PC Publisher: Koei Tecmo Developer: Team Ninja A Dead or Alive 6 review code was provided by the publisher.   3D fighting games are constantly evolving. Genre stalwarts such as Tekken and Soulcalibur have introduced new elements to its complex gameplay systems in order to bring more beginners into the fold. A few of these mechanics have also made both games far more exciting to follow in a tournament setting. Team Ninja must have been taking notes during the launch and post update periods for both games. With everything that’s been featured in Tekken 7 and Soulcalibur VI, Dead or Alive 6 has been given those same fresh features. And with the franchise’s solid fighting systems still at play, this entry proves to be one of the best evolutionary sequels in the series.  Dead or Alive is known to most fighting game fans as being one the best most visually striking brawlers on the market. Dead or Alive 6 maintains its franchise’s signature honor, thankfully. The varied collection of characters still look amazingly photo realistic. The sweat that drops from their bodies and the damage that becomes visible as their clothes begin to deteriorate do an awesome job of putting the strong graphics engine on display. The close-up camera shots make it a habit of showcasing the hard work put into the visible damage system, which is a plus. Everything else, including the huge stages and story mode cinematics, puts Dead or Alive 6 above its genre rivals in the graphics category.  In the audio department, this sequel performs at a level that’s slightly below its visuals. The hard hitting blows and wild stage elements still provide the powerful sounds you’d expect to hear. The new tracks are a bit too generic to matter much, but at least the presence of more memorable tracks from the series’ past pick up the slack in that department. One audio issue that’s hard to ignore is the iffy lip-synching that pops up during the story mode cutscenes. The english voice acting is solid enough, but witnessing characters’ mouths continue to move even after their dialogue has come to a close is jarring.  When it’s time to throwdown, Dead or Alive 6 provides experts and newcomers with a fulfilling experience. The easy to understand, hard to master Triangle System still makes up the bulk of the incredibly rewarding gameplay. A couple of new elements offer an even deeper experience that makes this entry more accessible and entertaining.  The added meter mechanic lets you utilize a super combo (Fatal Rush), a special counter to that maneuver (Break Hold), and a devastating move that sends your opponent flying (Break Blow). These fresh mechanics build upon the franchise’s solid foundation and makes each match enthralling to watch and play. Longtime fans will find new ways to pull off their best combo strings with legacy characters and fall in love with the new tricks the two newest characters bring to the fold. Diego and NiCO are fine additions to Dead or Alive’s growing roster and huge collection of combat stylings.  Dead or Alive 6 certainly gives you plenty of modes to busy yourself with. There’s a massive Story Mode to comb through, of course. And legacy modes such as Arcade, Survival, and Time Attack make their return. The most puzzling omission happens to be the fan favorite Tag Team battle mode. The joy that comes from mixing up your favorite characters and discovering their signature tag team holds is missing from this entry, sadly. One of the newer modes provides a more interesting way to learn the game’s ins and outs, though – DOA Quest. This mode’s mission-based structure will gradually push you along as you master the game’s deeper mechanics and each character’s unique approach to combat. DOA Quest provides a seemingly endless bout of fun that’s figuratively and literarily rewarding.  As you fulfill the three goals tied to each objective, you’ll be rewarded with classic tunes, online match titles, and in-game currency. The best rewards you’re granted are costume pattern parts, which goes towards unlocking the game’s array of attires. Getting better at the game’s mechanics and receiving all types of assorted goodies for your efforts is one of the better features making its debut here.  The only problem that lies within the reward system is the method in which costume pattern parts are applied. Once you acquire them, they’re automatically put towards whichever random costume that needs to be unlocked. This system could have been better implemented if the costume pattern parts were represented as a usable currency that allowed you to choose which costumes you’d prefer to use them on. Tinkering with the game’s character customization system is a blast. The fact that you can’t select which costumes you’d prefer to unlock over others is a bit of sore spot, though.  Dead or Alive 6 Takeways  Team Ninja has definitely taken notes on how to improve its fighting game franchise. The climactic close-up camera shots, new use of meter, and crowd-pleasing maneuvers make their way from other fighters into this sequel. Their implementation fits in perfectly with the franchise’s already tight combat mechanics. The high visual fidelity, nice offering of single-player/multiplayer modes, and strong character customization feature all provide a ton of replay value for this high-octane fighter. Even with the lack of a tag team mode and the issues present in how costume pattern parts are utilized, Dead or Alive 6 still stands as the most refreshing entry in the series.<|im_end|>

# Brother Nature trawls Lake Michigan for salmon, trout, adventures

After 40 years of fishing Lake Michigan, Mike Schoonveld has a pretty simple philosophy: “It’s not rocket science; it’s fish science.” Schoonveld, 69, operates Brother Nature Fishing Adventures, a charter fishing business taking two or three people out on the lake in his 21-foot boat in search of salmon and lake trout. He started doing it part-time in 1998 while working as a wildlife biologist for the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and made it his full-time occupation in 2009. “I always had an affinity for hunting and fishing, which led to my job with the IDNR, and then I developed a specific interest in fishing Lake Michigan, and I got proficient at doing that,” he said. “At the time I started in the '90s, almost all the charter boat captains were running cabin cruisers with five or six passengers.” With charter fees based on the cost of operation, the price was largely fixed whether the excursion included all six passengers or just two or three. “They all suggested I start a smaller operation for those smaller groups,” Schoonveld said. “I was probably the first person in Indiana that ran charters for a small boat with a limited number of passengers. Now it is more normal as the older guys are getting out of the business because it’s too costly.” His boat has all the safety equipment of the bigger boats, and he can usually take a group out any time the bigger boats do, though he does have to concede to the weather occasionally. “There’s no sense going out if you’re not going to have fun.” And the key component of fun is finding the fish. “Practice makes perfect,” Schoonveld said of how his 40 years on the lake has honed his fish radar. “One nice thing about fishing in Indiana is that most people are helpful getting newcomers started, and, if they are successful, they share the information.” As a wildlife biologist, he understands the fish and their life cycles, which helps in knowing where to find them and how they behave. He said it’s hard to say whether he learned that in college or from experience. He also has to understand the behavior of his customers. “Rather than talk politics or sports or what they do for a living, I try to keep the conversation on what we are doing and why we are going out. I try to be a teacher. If it’s something special, I talk about things going on on the Great Lakes, like the Asian carp, that will get people involved and make them more appreciative of the fishery and so they leave with a more well-rounded experience.” The business and the fish have changed since he started, especially during the recession of 2008, which saw fewer people taking fishing trips because they were worried about their jobs. The business has rebounded in the last couple of years, which has brought back some customers. Also, Schoonveld said the IDNR used to stock 500,000 chinook salmon in the lake every year. The salmon tended to congregate at the south end of the lake, which provided a steady stream of happy customers. The stocking is down to 60,000, making the popular king and chinook salmon are rarer catches. “They’ve gone from being a reliable part of the catch to just being an occasional one,” he said. “It makes it more exciting when you do catch one. It’s nice to know they are still there, and you can still catch one." They have been replaced by the lake trout, a native predator that were fairly insignificant in the past, maybe half a dozen a year, Schoonveld said. "We are now targeting and catching our limit on many days. They are big, strong fighters and have replaced the chinook as being a big part of the catch.” Schoonveld said he has watched many families grow up as they have chartered his boat for years. He’s had people from about half the states and more than a dozen foreign countries charter his boat but said he’s never had anyone from Australia. Schoonveld and his wife have been married 47 years and have two children, but they don’t share his love of fishing. His first charter for this year was scheduled for March 25, when he was ready once again to swap fishing tales. “I’m something of a story teller, and I have a million of them,” he said. “I thoroughly enjoy this, and I enjoy helping people get out and enjoy themselves. It’s a wonderful opportunity, and it’s opened avenues in the fishing world and others that I wouldn’t have had otherwise.”<|im_end|>

# Neighbours spoilers: Finn Kelly makes unexpected move as Toadie Rebecchi feud ESCALATES

Finn (played by Rob Mills) became a free man on Neighbours earlier this week as the court acquitted him of his past crimes following glowing testimonies by the likes of Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). Developments in the story will soon see Finn move in with Susan and her husband Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) as the character gets a regular status on the Channel 5 soap, with actor Rob Mills, 36, reprising is role as the former villain last year. Susan and Karl’s decision not only puts strain on the couple's marriage, but they will also feel the wrath of their neighbours, none more so than Toadie Rebecchi (Ryan Maloney). However, when Finn tries to help Toadie next week to show him he has changed his ways, the former felon decides to take unlawful action. Having recently returned to Ramsay Street following the sudden death of his wife Sonya Rebecchi (Eve Morey), Toadie isn’t in the best mood to be dealing with the likes of Finn. When the widower decides he wants to help the community in respect of his late wife, Toadie launches the Sonya Rebecchi Foundation. To get the idea up off the ground, Toadie begins promoting the scheme and organises a launch party, which Finn believes could be the perfect opportunity to make peace with the grieving Erinsborough resident. Not wanting Finn anywhere near his plans, Toadie strongly rejects the former villain's offer to help him, which only gives the reformed felon another idea. Knowing Toadie’s office will be empty, Finn breaks into the premises, but not for revenge, as he explains to Bea Nilsson (Bonnie Anderson). Seeing her abductor in such a state, reminding her of what he was like in the past before his amnesia, Bea presses Finn for answers as to why he’s taken unlawful action against Toadie. Having changed her testimony in court after witnessing Finn save the life of her aunt Susan, Bea is initially hurt to realise the Ramsay Street resident could be up to his old tricks. However, Finn explains he broke into Toadie’s office to leave a rather generous donation for the foundation, knowing full well the Neighbours icon wouldn’t take it from him. Still questioning whether Finn was telling the truth, Bea is proved wrong when Toadie is later seen filled with joy after coming across the anonymous donation. Speaking with Finn later after bumping into Toadie, Bea agrees to keep his secret. Will Toadie ever discover the truth and after months of speculation over whether Finn has changed, does this prove the villainous streak inside him has gone? It causes enormous tension Alan Fletcher, 62, recently told Express.co.uk of Karl’s relationship with Susan over the Finn drama: “It causes enormous tension between Susan and Karl because Susan’s looking to support Finn and doesn’t want Karl to do anything to undermine Finn.” Elsewhere in Ramsay Street, Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) will have a lot on her plate soon as her niece, Roxy Willis (Zima Anderson), arrives in Erinsborough. Roxy will make quite the entrance to the Australian soap as her wild-child antics will keep Terese on her toes. Following Roxy in the coming weeks will be her boyfriend Vance Abernathy (Conrad Coleby), but it seems the older gentleman has a history with his girlfriend’s aunt. Terese will tell her daughter Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) she once dated a man who encouraged her own wild behaviour back in the day.<|im_end|>

# Mexico's Mexichem first quarter net profit falls 39.3%

# Prince William Surprised His Teachers and Passed All of His High School Exams for a Truly Devastating Reason

Prince William was apparently not the best student in his high school days. The young royal "pleasantly surprised" his teachers when he passed all twelve of his GCSEs, according to royal expert and biographer Katie Nicholl. Sadly, William's academic success came on the heels of a great loss, the death of his mother, Princess Diana. According to Nicholl, Will threw himself into his studies as a means of distraction after his mother's tragic death. Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997. Being royal doesn't mean that you're automatically great at everything, even though it can definitely seem like it does from the outside. Case-in-point: Prince William might be second in line to the British throne, but the future King of England was also a lackluster student in high school. In her book Kate: The Future Queen, royal expert and biographer Katie Nicholl shares some details about Will's time in high school, before his now-famous college meet-cute with his future wife, Kate Middleton. According to Nicholl, Will always knew that he was different from his classmates and chose to lean into any awkwardness about his royal status with jokes: "Throughout his school life, William was well aware of how different he was. He would joke on the weekends that he was 'off to WC,' which baffled his friends at first until they realized he didn't mean the toilet, but nearby Windsor Castle, 'to see Granny.'" But, being popular and funny doesn't always mean being the best of students and Will was no exception. In fact, his teachers at Eton College (Will's secondary school—the British equivalent of high school) apparently didn't think Will would even pass his GCSEs—General Certificate of Secondary Education, a set of tests that, if passed, basically give students the equivalent of their high school diploma. "He had pleasantly surprised his teachers at Eton when he passed each of his twelve GCSEs, excelling in English, history, and languages," Nicholl wrote. That's great, of course, but one of the reasons that Will appeared to turn things around academically? That's just devastating. The teenaged royal apparently focused on school as a way to cope with the loss of his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a car accident in August 1997. "The loss to Prince William and Prince Harry was almost unbearable, and when William returned to school, he threw himself into his studies as a distraction," Nicholl explained.<|im_end|>

# Art exhibition in a former garden centre examines our relationship with nature

Art exhibition in a former garden centre examines our relationship with nature  PUBLISHED: 16:13 25 April 2019  Archant  Rewind/Rewild at Omved Gardens in Highgate shows work about the extinction of Scottish wolves and the Great Auk to bowls of festering pond weed  A former garden centre has been converted into a light-filled event space that is appropriately hosting an art show about our relationship with nature. Set in beautiful grounds off Highgate Hill, Omved Gardens is the venue for Rewind/Rewild, which assembles work by 10 artists with subjects ranging from the extinction of Scottish wolves and the Great Auk, to the garden of Eden and festering pond weed. Previously leased to Capital Gardens who are based in Alexandra Palace, the space in Townsend Yard is perfect for the exhibition, according to Stroud Green resident Anna Souter, who co-curates the show: “It's an amazing setting of former greenhouses in huge gardens redesigned by an architect to create a modernist space,” she says. “Most of the walls are made of glass so when you look up you see these trees moving in the breeze. It's so different from the traditional windowless white cube space of most galleries, which are closed off from the world and can make you feel the art exists outside of time and real life. “Because the glasshouse is a perforated space, it emphasises the impact of what you are looking at, and asks how art has a role to play in a wider ecosystem.” That ties in nicely with the exhibition's theme of 'rewilding.' Souter describes the idea as “an alternative to the conservation movement which looks at landscape and suggests ways we can restore a balance to the ecosystem”. “Rather than intervening or prioritising things like farming, you take a step back and allow natural processes to resume.” Eradicating species from an area can create what are termed: 'trophic cascades' she says. “It's hard to know what the effect of changing something will be, but there are keystone species which are essential to an ecosystem and removing that plant or animal will have an unintended but widespread knock on effect on its surroundings. “Rewilding can involve reintroducing these native species where they have been wiped out by habitat loss or other forms of human interference. The exhibition is a lens for thinking about the role of human beings within the natural world and whether we can coexist with other species in a productive rather than a controlling way.  You may also want to watch:  Ranging from video installations, to sculpture and photographs, the exhibition includes Beatrice Searle's Foregathered wi The Beast, about the last wolf killed in Scotland. A stone by a layby of the A9 outside Brora records Polson, the hunter who killed the last wolf in Scotland 'about the year 1700'. “My thought was to make a new stone that would address the Polson stone from across the lay-by and offer an alternative version of events- a memorial to the last wolf, a lament, a protest, a hope for the future,” says Searle who co-curates the exhibition. “The guerilla act of making and installing a stone that speaks directly into the space left by the wolves aims to challenge the story that has persisted for three centuries, remake the legacy of wolves in Scotland and mark the place as the start of the demise of the Highland ecosystem.” Souter says that in places such as America where wolves have been reintroduced it has “increased the biodiversity and fertility of that landscape.” “Her monument expresses hopes that wolves might return.” In Clenched, Julia Crabtree and William Evans fill blown glass vessels with water and pond weed and watche how they interact with their surroundings. “There is a living element as changes in air and response to light and bacteria creates a shared agency between the artists and the plants, and references the interconnectivity between humans and natural world,” says Souter. “We don't lilve outside the world we are very much part of it.” Marcus Coates' Apology to The Great Auk saw him travel to Newfoundland to gather a community of local residents including the Mayor of the local town to read out an apology to the flightless bird, which was last spotted off that coast in 1852. Meanwhile Rodrigo Arteaga's Diorama is a large mobile which rotates and balances a dog, a log, a stick and a plant. As a metaphor for our coexistence with nature, it's perfect: “Remove one and the whole work collapses”. Rewind/Rewild runs at Omved Gardens, Townsend Yard, Highgate from May 1-7 and includes a one day rewilding symposium with scientists and artists.<|im_end|>

# Trace McSorley Clocks Fastest 40-Yard Dash By Quarterback At NFL Combine

Trace McSorley Clocks Fastest 40-Yard Dash By Quarterback At NFL Combine Penn State legend Trace McSorley has an uphill battle toward securing a spot on an NFL roster as a quarterback, but he helped his case during the NFL Scouting Combine Saturday morning.  McSorley led all quarterbacks in the 40-yard-dash when he ran it in 4.57 seconds.  Only one other quarterback ran a sub-4.6: Buffalo’s Tyree Jackson, who clocked a 4.59. At the bottom of the leaderboard was former Ohio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins, whose 40 time came in at 5.04. For comparison’s sake, Penn State lineman Ryan Bates’s 40 time was 5.09.  McSorley’s game-breaking speed and mobility are going to be his two biggest strengths while he’s evaluated by NFL teams. At Penn State, McSorley provided a dynamic wrinkle to the Nittany Lion offense by extending broken plays and giving opposing defenses another threat to account for. He ran for 30 touchdowns and 1,697 yards in college.  Proving himself as an NFL quarterback seems to be McSorley’s priority. Multiple teams requested he participate in Combine drills with the defensive backs, but he declined, reportedly to focus on his preparations as a quarterback.  Your ad blocker is on.

# Under-fire Jorginho scores winner for Chelsea against Fulham

As unlikely as it would have felt in the immediate aftermath of Kepa Arrizabalaga’s histrionics and that penalty shootout defeat at Wembley, this has been a restorative week for Chelsea. A second successive derby victory in the period since, albeit one ground out against spirited opposition, has moved Maurizio Sarri’s side back to within two points of the top four, and only five off third-placed Tottenham Hotspur, and all with a game still in hand to fuel hope.  More significantly, perhaps, there are signs of acceptance again amid what had been a mutinous support. Just 10 days after being booed on to the turf by his team’s own fans, Jorginho, a player who personifies Maurizio Sarri’s regime, was serenaded appreciatively by those in the Putney End after his most impressive, progressive display in weeks, albeit against a Fulham side who opted against employing a man-marker to snap at his every touch of the ball. Sarri, too, will have curried favour with successive victories over local rivals and departed with a wave and a smile, while Kepa is re-established as this team’s first-choice goalkeeper.  It was far from easy for the Spaniard here, with Fulham’s attacking verve renewed under Scott Parker’s caretaker management, but he grew into this contest and, two minutes from time, preserved the visitors’ success. The Fulham substitute Floyd Ayité had wriggled beyond Antonio Rüdiger and hooked over an inviting centre which was met by a slap from Aleksandar Mitrovic’s forehead, only for Kepa to leap to his left and push away the Serbian’s effort at full stretch. That curtailed the hosts’ hopes, their chances of avoiding relegation slimmer with every passing week. For Chelsea, however, there is optimism again.  They had weathered Fulham’s second-half revival but, in truth, they should have settled the contest more clearly by the break. Gonzalo Higuaín, revelling in the space afforded him by the home side’s backline, might have registered his first Chelsea hat-trick even before the interval with the visitors slicing through at will. He had already guided a free header wide and would subsequently blaze over the crossbar from Jorginho’s wonderfully arced pass.  Not to be denied, the Argentinean met César Azpilicueta’s low centre emphatically midway through the period to fizz the ball inside Sergio Rico’s near post. That was the first league goal this team had mustered away from Stamford Bridge this calendar year, though they had threatened further reward every time the combinations of Willian and Azpilicueta, or Emerson and Eden Hazard, had scuttled forward down the flanks.  Rico would deny Higuaín after an almost identical buildup in first-half stoppage time, this time deflecting the attempt round the upright, with the overworked goalkeeper having just blocked from Hazard after Denis Odoi’s error. Fulham had actually restored parity by then, though that had merely been a four-minute respite. The hosts, outraged at the non-awarding of a free-kick against Jorginho, would be prised apart by another slick counter which culminated in Hazard cutting into the penalty area. The Belgian might have spat away his own shot but, instead, slid a pass across to Jorginho, untracked on the edge of the box, who curled a glorious shot into the top corner.  That appeared to restore some order, though Fulham had offered plenty of threat of their own. Parker had made only one change from Claudio Ranieri’s last game in charge back in midweek, but there was renewed belief and energy from the likes of Ryan Sessegnon and Tom Cairney, mainstays of the team promoted last May. Their defence may still be porous and obliging, but this side carries an attacking threat.  Kepa, his various punishments spent after that show of petulance late on against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final a week ago, had endured some uncomfortable moments in the swirling wind and constant drizzle. The Spaniard had spilled Kevin McDonald’s centre in his own six-yard box just after the quarter-hour mark, only to react and recover before Ryan Babel could locate the bouncing ball. His save from Mitrovic’s volley, side-footed powerfully from Sessegnon’s deflected centre, was a reminder of his qualities, though Chelsea were still undone at the resultant corner.  There is a vulnerability still to this side. No one had tracked Calum Chambers, loitering beyond the far post, as the hosts exchanged passes at the short corner. Babel’s centre drifted over the clutter in the six-yard box and was met on the volley by the Arsenal loanee, with Kepa helpless and exposed.  The goalkeeper would make smart saves to deny Cairney and Bryan after the interval before that fine save thwarted Mitrovic. By the end Parker, who saw Sessegnon denied an even later equaliser by an assistant’s flag, had developed that familiar look of grim acceptance worn by Fulham’s managers this term. His side had stretched their local rivals, but come away pointless yet again.<|im_end|>

# Malabu scandal: How Shell, Eni used Nigeria's share to fund alleged bribery scheme – analysis | TODAY.NG

New analysis has found that oil giants Shell and Eni’s controversial deal for a Nigerian oil licence included unprecedented terms which funded an alleged bribery scheme.  The terms replicated military-rule era “Sole Risk” contracts, and boosted Shell and Eni’s internal valuations of the oil deal enough to justify the companies paying $1.1bn upfront.  Italian prosecutors allege that the $1.1 billion paid by Shell and Eni for the OPL 245 licence was used to pay former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete and “intended for payment to President Jonathan, members of the government, and other Nigerian public officials.”  Shell, Eni and some of their senior managers are now standing trial, charged with international corruption, with prosecution pending in other countries.  The award of military era style contracts for deep water fields to huge international oil companies appears to be unprecedented since the advent of civil government in Nigeria. The deal transferred massive economic benefits to the companies at the expense of the Nigerian people by giving away Nigeria’s right to its share of the oil produced, terms which resemble ‘Sole Risk’ contracts granted only to Nigerian companies during military rule in Nigeria’s Deep Water.  The Nigerian Department of Petroleum Resources currently lists the OPL 245 license as a Sole Risk type contract in its annual report.  The analysis of Shell and Eni’s valuation documents prepared before they agreed the deal in 2011 appears to show that the transfer of Nigeria’s share of future revenue to the companies was essential for the companies to be willing to pay over a billion dollars upfront, money that prosecutors say was used to pay massive bribes.  The analysis also found that the Nigerian state’s ability to buy their rights back was heavily restricted in the deal with Nigeria having to pay $650m plus interest up front to re-acquire a stake worth an estimated $2 billion in future revenue. These rights would still leave Nigeria with a far lower share of the oil production than recommended by the IMF, and 15 per cent or $3.5 billion lower than previous terms for the same license.  The analysis was carried out by expert oil consultancy firm, Resources for Development, commissioned by NGOs Global Witness, HEDA, Re:Common and The Corner House using publicly available documents including Shell and Eni’s valuations of the oil block.  An analysis published in late 2018 by the same firm showed that the terms of the contract could reduce the Nigerian government’s revenue from the fields by $5.86 billion over the lifetime of the project when compared to the standard Production Sharing Contract (PSC) terms in place in Nigeria since 2005, assuming an oil price of $70 per barrel.  Emails between Shell managers at the time showed they were aware that the deal would not give Nigeria rights to the share of its oil that is usual in deals between country governments and international companies.  Nigeria’s most senior civil servant in the Department of Petroleum Resources objected strongly to the terms of the deal at the time, calling it “highly prejudicial to the interests of the Federal Government”, but Nigerian ministers appeared to have ignored or overruled these concerns. Shell managers had been briefed that the ministers who overruled civil servants to approve the deal were likely to receive bribes.  Nigeria is currently pursuing civil claims against Shell and Eni over the deal which they claim “Shell and Eni engaged in for “bribery and unlawful conspiracy” to harm the Federal Republic of Nigeria and that they dishonestly assisted corrupt Nigerian government officials.”  The current Nigerian Attorney General, Abubakar Malami, reportedly suggested that Nigeria could reach a settlement with the companies with a deal including Nigeria re-acquiring a stake in OPL 245. President Buhari reportedly rejected any settlement, ordered a halt to development of the oil block until all issues are resolved and the legal process has run its course.  Barnaby Pace, a campaigner at Global Witness said, “We’ve known of allegations of vast bribery in this deal for years. Now we’ve learned that Shell and Eni profited unfairly through military era contract terms meaning that it was Nigeria’s share of oil that was used to fuel profiteering and payoffs. It is simply unacceptable that Shell and Eni should be allowed to hold on to this scandalous deal.”  “These companies and Nigerian officials agreed a sweetheart deal that deprives Nigeria of money it badly needs to build schools and pay doctors. President Buhari should reject any deal that leaves the OPL 245 oil license with these companies,” said Olanrewaju Suraju of HEDA.  “Shell and Eni represented their OPL 245 contract as a production sharing system, yet it includes no sharing of production for Nigeria. This shockingly poor deal must be cancelled,” said Nick Hildyard of The Corner House.  “The Italian government is discouraging Nigerian migrants trying to reach Italy by claiming that it will help them at home, but Italy’s biggest multinational, part owned by the state, is accused of depriving the Nigerian people of billions. The OPL 245 scandal appears to show that Italians are not helping the poorest, but profiting from them,” said Antonio Tricarico of Re:Common.  Shell and Eni were asked for their comments on the analyses. Both companies and their managers have denied wrongdoing and criminality in the deal. Shell stated that “In line with correct legal process, many of these issues will be considered by the court and we do not wish to interfere with those proceedings”.  Eni claimed in light of their ongoing trial, Eni is “unable to disclose… information relevant for the pending proceedings, nor is it otherwise willing to publicly disclose data that are sensitive in nature.” They noted that Eni appointed experts in court will “cover the significant benefits for Nigeria” from the deal and that it will be shown to be “transparent, lawful and beneficial for Nigeria”.<|im_end|>

# Top Biden aide: He's at the top of presidential primary polls because people 'know who he is'

WASHINGTON — Kate Bedingfield, the deputy campaign manager for former Vice President Joe Biden's presidential bid, argued Thursday that Biden can be the change that Democratic voters are looking for despite being one of the oldest candidates in the field.  "Voters know Joe Biden. I think they know he's a man of character, he's a man of empathy," she said on MSNBC.  "And, I think, as Democrats are looking for a change — and frankly, it's voters across the country looking for a change from what we currently have in the White House — there's no bigger change than Joe Biden."

# The Fashion Gospel According to Erika Jayne

Ever since Erika Jayne joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in 2015, the 90210 zip code has had a healthy—and frankly much-needed—injection of fashion. While fellow cast members like Kyle Richards and Lisa Vanderpump have the market covered on flowing caftans and prim button-downs paired with Chanel bags and huge diamonds, Jayne came in hot with fresh-off-the-runway Moschino, Tom Ford, and staggeringly high heels to match. Four seasons later, Jayne is still serving big, bold looks—bigger and bolder, probably—prompting the other cast members, new and old, to step up their fashion game. It only makes sense, then, that the reality star (who also has a successful musical career on the side) was tapped by ShoeDazzle to create her own line of footwear to satiate her many fashion devotees. When I meet Jayne in her hotel suite, which she’s transformed into an ad hoc shoe showroom, during her recent trip to New York, she is dressed in an oversize T-shirt paired with patent leather leggings and high-heeled pumps. It’s 3 p.m. on a Thursday, and this is a casual look for her. “These are so comfortable,” she says, gesturing to her ShoeDazzle pumps, which are emblazoned with the words “Pretty Mess” (both her personal brand and Instagram handle). Such is life when you’re Erika Jayne. Here, the Housewife breaks down her quintessential fashion rules, as only she can. What was the concept behind the shoe line? Two lives: Erika Jayne and Erika Girardi. You get to be your fantasy, over-the-top self with Erika Jayne, and with Erika Girardi you get to be a bossy babe. But even that’s a little shiny and fabulous. What was hard was cutting back. There were so many ways that you could go. And making sure that the ShoeDazzle client was served, as well, because maybe I don’t like something that they like. That was really the fun part about it. Were there any designs that you didn’t know which Erika alter ego to assign them to? I still don’t know for some. That’s the beauty of it. I mean, I know the sparkly ones are Erika Jayne. How many pairs of shoes do you own? Personally? It’s gotta be in the hundreds. For sure. Do you have a room for them? Not a room. I have two rooms. [Laughs.] Meaning, I have two closets, and there are shoes in each closet. They get rotated around depending on what season we are in or what we’re doing or where we’re going. What was the most recent pair that you bought? I bought a pair of baby pink 120s and robin’s egg blue 120s. Louboutin. They’re right over there. Do you have a favorite pair? I have favorites for different reasons. I tend to wear a lot of 120s in different prints, colors, and skins. Actually, my favorite is an over-the-knee, up-to-my-waist boot. With a heel. Do you think about comfort at all when it comes to your shoes? Comfort? [Laughs.] Listen, what are we talking about? Are they as comfortable as my Nikes? No. Do I expect that out of my pumps? No. It’s two different things. You’re either a pumps girl or you’re not. Do you ever try tricks to make them more comfortable, like using CBD oil on your feet? Oh, my God, is that a thing? Really? I think because I grew up a ballerina, I’m so used to having my feet tortured that nothing hurts at this point. I’m dead, it’s great. But CBD oil on your feet? Holy shit. [Yells to the other room:] Did you hear that? We need CBD oil for my feet. Loading What are your earliest memories of fashion? My mom was taking disco dance classes at the Fred Astaire studio. I was about 5 or 6, and I put on her disco shoes and her fake DVF wrap dress. What was your style like as a teenager? Long blonde hair to my waist, crimped with bangs—’80s disaster. A fabulous disaster. I loved a side pony. I still love to rock a side pony. Do you keep all of your old stuff? Yes, I do. My mom has tons of it. It’s funny shit. And I do have some things that I re-wear, and some of my mom’s stuff from the ’80s that I wear. What’s been your ultimate, unexpected holy grail purchase? I found a pair of Tom Ford boots in the corner of Bergdorfs for, like, $200. I could not believe people weren’t buying them. They’re fucking fabulous. They are black patent leather Tom Ford boots. I only found one, and there was no mate. I saw a piece of patent leather sticking out and was like, “What is that?” I have that radar. I dug it out, and it was my size, and I said to the man, “Where’s the mate to this boot?” And he came out with it. It was, like, my favorite thing ever. Are you a good shopper? No. Well, what do you mean by good shopper? I’m an impatient shopper and a fast shopper. I don’t like to shop with nonprofessionals. Do you go in with something in mind? No. I just go in with an open mind and can scan things quickly. I’m looking for things for work. Does that make sense? Everything is work related. Is it something I need? Something I don’t have? Something I can use? Something for the future? Is there anything you have too much of but can’t stop buying? I can probably lose a few sweatpants, but I refuse. I would live my life in sweatpants if I could, but I can’t. Then you’d be giving up, like Uncle Karl [Lagerfeld] said. You’ve given up in life if you’re wearing sweatpants all the time, and I can’t do that. Kim Kardashian does it. Yes, but she made sweatpants cool because she wore them with crop tops and pumps. It’s not really that. Do you watch fashion shows and keep tabs on things that you want to buy? With my life, I have to wear things that look good on me and not necessarily what’s poppin’. I think I have great taste, but great taste for me. Personal style. I couldn’t look at you and know what is best for you, but I know what works on my body. I like theatrical stuff and things that maybe the average bear would be turned off to, but that’s my stuff. Loading Has there ever been a trend you tried that really didn’t work out? There’s a beauty trend I tried that just didn’t work, and that was bleaching my eyebrows. I hated that. As far as fashion trends, no, there has never been something that I really regretted. Do you have any fashion regrets? Do you watch old episodes and think, “I should not have worn that”? I do, but nothing like, “Oh, my, God.” Just like, “That could have been better.” Do you log what outfits you have worn? Absolutely. We make a full deck on Housewives of every look that I’ve worn so we don’t repeat it, and if you do, you mix it up with other pieces that aren’t instantly recognizable. That’s usually basics that you wouldn’t catch. Do you look to anyone for style inspiration? That’s cloudy because I am looking for things that are specific to me. It’s not that I don’t appreciate a lot of people, it’s just that I’m so self-involved that I can’t see the forest through the trees. But I am quick to point out when I think something looks good on someone. What are your biggest fashion obsessions right now? I’m addicted to sweatpants. [Laughs.] I really am. Whenever I’m not working, I’m wearing sweatpants. When you get home at the end of the day— All this shit comes off. I take my lashes off, every drop of makeup off, my hair down—all this drag comes off. But do you run errands in your sweats? You better believe I do. People get real disappointed.<|im_end|>

# Heating Up! Kate Beckinsale, Pete Davidson Hold Hands at 'SNL' Afterparty

The comedian, 25, and the Underworld alum, 45, were spotted holding hands as they entered the event at Dos Caminos Mexican restaurant in NYC. In pictures posted on Twitter by Abby Shanor, Beckinsale stunned in an all-black ensemble with her brunette hair down in loose waves as she walked a step behind her rumored beau with her fingers intertwined with his.  Davidson, meanwhile, paired jeans and a colorful puffer jacket with a T-shirt made by his pal John Mulaney’s wife, Annamarie Tendler, which she gifted the comedians ahead of Saturday night’s taping, which was hosted by the former SNL writer.  Ariana Grande‘s ex-fiancé and his new gal pal “were holding hands going in at 1:30 a.m. and holding hands going out at 3 a.m.,” a source told Us Weekly of their late-night outing. “There was not much emotion since it was such a short walk to their car. They didn’t stop for anyone going into the party but Pete signed a few things on the way out for people. They were escorted by a security guard both times.”  Their Big Apple weekend of fun didn’t end there. Beckinsale and Davidson opted for a sportier date on Sunday, March 3, where they could be seen giggling together at a New York Rangers game.  Beckinsale — who was in NYC to celebrate the spring issue of Dujour magazine — revealed to Extra the night prior to her two-day rendezvous with Davidson that her ideal man is “funny.” The Serendipity actress and the Big Time Adolescence star first sparked romance rumors when they were spotted flirting at multiple Golden Globes afterparties in January.  “She was following him around a bit and waiting for him,” an insider explained to Us at the time. “People approached her and she didn’t want to talk to anyone else. … It definitely seemed like Kate was interested in him.”  They have been spotted together since then, and more recently, a source told Us: “Kate is so into Pete and has been telling all her friends about him. They have great chemistry, and she loves hanging out with him whenever they get the chance to. She has such a fun, young, loving personality.”  As for Davidson, the feeling is mutual. “Pete only has eyes for Kate. She’s cool and fun,” another source revealed to Us. “It’s long-distance, but they’re taking it slow. She makes him laugh. He thinks she’s great and really smart. They have an incredible physical connection.”  Sparks between Beckinsale and Davidson started flying less than three months after the SNL star and Grande ended their four-month engagement in October 2018. Beckinsale, meanwhile, was previously married to Len Wiseman and has dated Michael Sheen and Matt Rife.

# Nets 88 - HEAT 117 Game Recap | Miami Heat

Nets 88 - HEAT 117 Game Recap  
      Photo Credit: Issac Baldizon     
  

   The Miami HEAT defeated the Brooklyn Nets 117-88 Saturday night at AmericanAirlines Arena. Kelly Olynyk led the way for the HEAT with 25 points.  1. KO Keeps Up Strong Play  Simply put, Olynyk continued to cause headaches for the opposition due to his versatility.  After going off in the second quarter for 11 points on 4-of-7 shooting thanks to a couple threes and this great drive to the basket where he fooled the Nets with a bevy of fakes…  …he carried over his sharp play into the third and cut to the hoop for some nifty finishes at the rim.  In addition to his team-high 25 points on 9-of-13 shooting, including 3-of-5 from deep, Olynyk also had six rebounds, four assists, two blocks and a steal.  2. DJJ Nearly Records A Career High  As usual, Derrick Jones Jr. moved off the ball very well and either finished plays inside or knocked down catch-and-shoot treys.  For an example of the former, just check out this thunderous jam early in the second quarter:  That’s “Airplane Mode” at his finest.  Naturally, Jones Jr. also wreaked havoc on the defensive end with his length and came through with this crazy block on Spencer Dinwiddie in transition late in the third:  When it was all said and done, the 22-year-old tallied 18 points on 7-of-10 shooting and four rebounds to go along with that block above.  3. Winslow Sets The Tone  Early on, Justise Winslow got into the paint at will and attacked Brooklyn’s defense head-on. As a result, he hit six of his first seven shots and dished out some nice assists throughout the contest.  And of course, he also did his thing on the defensive end in both man and zone looks. This block on Dinwiddie late in the second quarter is proof of that:  Winslow ended up with 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting, six assists, four rebounds and that aforementioned block.  Other Takeaways:  -Bam Adebayo had another solid outing as a starter, as he balled out on both ends of the floor. In addition to protecting the rim and defending well on the perimeter, Adebayo also showed great vision on the offensive end and tied a career high with six assists on the night.  Among all his dimes, perhaps this one between Rodions Kurucs and Ed Davis late in the third quarter was the most impressive:  Adebayo finished with nine points, a team-high 16 boards and two blocks to go along with his six assists.  Game Notes:  -Hassan Whiteside (Left Hip Strain) and Yante Maten (Sioux Falls Assignment) were inactive.  -Goran Dragić (Left Calf Strain) was an active scratch.  Looking Ahead:  -Up next for the HEAT are the Atlanta Hawks on Monday at 7:30 PM. Tickets for that game at AmericanAirlines Arena can be found here.<|im_end|>

# LeBron James Is the King of the Wardrobe Remix

Of all the style leaders in the NBA, LeBron James is one of the most classic. While Russell Westbrook, P.J. Tucker, and James Harden will try anything once, James sticks with neutral colors, classic shapes, and avoids the temptation of Instagram gimmicks (for the most part). And yet everything about the way he dresses feels like it belongs in the wild-style era we call 2019. That’s because King James hasn’t let his love of tailoring and topcoats stop him from trying new things, like rag socks and cropped pants or an untucked dress shirt. It’s also because, even while his gear isn’t fashioned out of say, purple leather, he still puts himself together with the confidence and free-spiritedness this moment in menswear demands. Take what James wore to the Lakers-Pelicans game in LA earlier this week: a moto jacket by John Elliott, some Tom Ford trousers, a black sweatshirt, paisley Air Force 1 FlyKnit sneakers, a handful of silver pendant necklaces, and Buddy Holly glasses. Sure, all these items are classic and, to an extent, simple in design, but none of them traditionally belong together—and that’s the 2019 tell right there. Whether you’re into feathers or snakeskin or just...gray wool, wearing serious clothes in an unserious way is what defines men’s style right now. Take comfort in this if you feel overwhelmed by the prospect of wearing today’s leather pants, lace blouses, and neon-bright suits. Instead, take Bron’s lead and just loosen up what you’re already doing by trying new combinations that feel a little off in a good way, and occasionally throwing in something you wouldn’t have worn in 2009. (Here are just 24 ideas of what that thing could be.)<|im_end|>

# Tesla Pickup truck will debut later this year confirms Elon Musk

Tesla has made a number of changes over the past few weeks and is set to roll out a number of new cars. This began with the news that the cheapest Model 3 was being made available to order and prices for the Model S and Model X have also been revised. You can now pick up a top spec Model S for over £40,000 less than older versions of the car. On Sunday Elon Musk also confirmed that the Model Y would be unveiled on March 14th. The Model Y is an electric crossover equivalent to the Model 3. Musk stated that the car will have 10 per cent less range and be 10 per cent more expensive than the Model 3 but full pricing and specs will be confirmed at the event next week. The Tesla CEO also quietly confirmed that the Tesla Pickup truck will be unveiled later this year. One person asked if the ‘Model Y was the truck’ to which the electric car boss replied that the unveil for that car is “later this year.” While responding to another question on Twitter her shared his enthusiasm for the pickup. "Personally, I’m most excited by the Tesla Truck. "Maybe it will be too futuristic for most people, but I love it,” he said. Previously, in an interview last year with Recode the carmaker stated that the car looked like it comes out of Blade Runner. “Well I can’t talk about the details, but it’s gonna be like a really futuristic-like cyberpunk, “Blade Runner” pickup truck,” he said. “It’s gonna be awesome, it’s gonna be amazing. “This will be heart-stopping. It stops my heart. It’s like, oh, it’s great.” The Tesla Truck or Pickup Truck is expected to go into production after the Model Y in 2020.<|im_end|>

# Quarry Bank Mill CLOSED after staff hit by mystery virus

Quarry Bank Mill has closed to the public 'until further notice' after its staff were struck down with a mystery illness.  The major National Trust attraction in Styal was shut early on Saturday, with members of the public asked to leave the venue.  According to Manchester Evening News , several staff have been taken ill with sickness and diarrhoea.  A statement on Quarry Bank Mill's website reads: "We’re really sorry, due to a high level of staff illness we’re unable to open at the moment.  "You might like to visit one of our neighbouring properties. Please keep an eye on our website for the latest information."  Public Health England (PHE) are now believed to have now launched an investigation, and it is not thought the venue will reopen for the next few days.  Rita Huyton, Acting Nurse Consultant from PHE’s North West Centre, said: “We are working closely with a number of local partners to establish the cause of the illness.  "At this stage it’s not possible to pinpoint exactly the source of the illness, or determine whether it originated at Quarry Bank, and further investigation is ongoing.”  “The National Trust at Quarry Bank took the decision to close the property as a precaution although it is impossible at this stage to say where the illness originated. We are working with the management team at Quarry Bank and a number of other partners who are fully supporting the investigation."  And in a statement the National Trust said: "Due to a high level of staff illness we’re unable to open Quarry Bank at the moment. This is a large site which needs to be properly staffed and we want to make sure we are able to look after our visitors properly and do all we can to minimise further illness.  "We are not sure what has caused the illness, but we are looking into it with help from the local environmental health officer. While we understand people will be disappointed, we won’t reopen until we are completely satisfied that everything is back to normal."  It comes less than a year after Quarry Bank Mill recently underwent an extensive refurbishment, reopening to the public last summer.<|im_end|>

# Pennsylvania auditor general critical of $4.25 billion diverted to state police

April 25, 2019  More than $4 billion was diverted from road and bridge repairs in Pennsylvania to fund the state police over the last seven years, Auditor General Eugene DePasquale said Thursday.  The findings come from a PennDOT audit that uncovered $4.25 billion going from the state's Motor License Fund to state police since the fiscal year 2012-13.  Collected from the state's gas tax, the Motor License Fund has long been a major source of funding for the Pennsylvania State Police. In 2017, as much as 65 percent of the state police budget, approximately $1.2 billion, came from the fund, WHYY reported last year. DePasquale said this funding method is preventing PennDOT from repairing rough highways and fixing 2,829 structurally deficient bridges across Pennsylvania.  “There’s a whopping 57.6 cents of state tax added to each gallon of gas sold in Pennsylvania,” DePasquale said. “Pennsylvanians are frustrated that our roads and bridges still need so much help at the same time we are paying the highest gas tax in the United States.”  About half of Pennsylvania's more than 2,500 municipalities rely exclusively on state police for their law enforcement needs, while others use part-time coverage from state troopers.  While lawmakers have capped the amount of money that can be transferred to state police from the Motor License Fund, the $800 million diverted in fiscal year 2017-18 accounted for about 29 percent of payments made from the fund that year.  “The nearly $800 million that came out of the fund in one year could have helped PennDOT make a significant dent in the list of urgent needs across Pennsylvania,” he added. “While State Police certainly deserve to be adequately funded, I don’t think anyone is thrilled about seeing gas tax revenues being siphoned off for purposes other than improving our roads and bridges.”  The PennDOT audit also examined how grants are awarded through the Transportation Infrastructure Investment Fund and Multimodal Transportation Fund. DePasquale said there should be greater transparency for project selection, better competition to serve the whole state and faster grant cycles to get projects underway.  The state police issues continue to be a political conundrum for the state. Gov. Tom Wolf last year proposed a $25 fee per person in municipalities that rely on state police for law enforcement. His supporters say the proposed fee is too low, while opponents believe any potential fee should be tied to a minimum population in affected municipalities.  DePasquale would like to see all of the gas tax money eventually go toward addressing Pennsylvania's infrastructure.  “More than 2,800 state-maintained bridges across Pennsylvania are structurally deficient and our bridges average over 50 years in age – beyond what they were designed to last,” DePasquale said. “That $4.25 billion could have cut that list in half and if PennDOT could use all of the gas tax money for roads and bridges we could get that number to zero in about 5 years.”<|im_end|>

# Ajinkya Rahane: India batsman to join Hampshire as overseas player

Ajinkya Rahane: India batsman to join Hampshire as overseas player  India batsman Ajinkya Rahane will join Hampshire as their overseas player from the middle of May until early July. The right-hander is set to be available for eight County Championship matches, subject to visa clearance. Rahane, 30, will replace batsman Aiden Markram, who is to join South Africa's World Cup squad. "We're delighted to attract a player of his class and he was really keen to come," Hampshire director of cricket Giles White told BBC Radio Solent. India vice-captain Rahane will be Hampshire's first overseas player from the country and is expected to make his debut against Warwickshire at Edgbaston from 14 May. "We're delighted to get him over here, it's a great fit for us and he showed an interest in coming to play county cricket at the back end of last winter," White added. "It's different conditions over here, but he has played several times before at the Ageas Bowl and enjoyed batting here. "We're looking forward to seeing what he can offer both on and off the pitch." Rahane has been playing for Rajasthan Royals in this year's India Premier League, but was replaced as captain by Australia's Steve Smith. He averages 40.55 in Test cricket, having scored just under 3,500 runs in 95 innings, with nine centuries.<|im_end|>

# Oregon House approves ban on plastic bags at grocery stores, large retailers

Using reusable bags instead of plastic bags is a big plus for the environment. But, if you forget to clean them, they could become a major negative for your health. Statesman Journal The Oregon House approved a statewide ban on single-use plastic shopping bags. Lawmakers voted 42-18 Thursday to prohibit large retailers and grocery stores from offering plastic checkout bags. Stores are able to offer recycled paper bags and reusable plastic bags for a 5 cent fee. Republicans complained the move limits consumer choice and that those decisions should be left for local communities to decide. Many Oregon cities have already banned plastic checkout bags including Salem, Portland and Corvallis. A ban in Silverton will begin being enforced July 1. The measure now goes to the Senate for consideration. Oregon would become the third state to enact a ban on plastic shopping bags, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The state is also considering bans on plastic straws and styrofoam to-go containers. Make the switch: How to switch to reusable bags and make the habit stick<|im_end|>

# False Messiah

False Messiah  In one sense, True Messiah is the poster boy for why Kickstarter exists. It was funded independently of any major publisher, it’s a little oddball, it stands well beyond the usual circles, and happens to be designed by a newcomer with some digital game design experience but no name in tabletop. A passion project, in other words, and one that likely wouldn’t have been birthed without crowdfunding. This is the very reason Kickstarter was lauded as a platform in the first place.  In another sense, however, it’s also a poster boy for why crowdfunded passion projects that stand well beyond the usual circles aren’t always everything they’re cracked up to be.   Here’s the pitch. Buckle up.  In the near future, somebody invents the Belief Engine, which transmutes — you guessed it — belief into reality. Exactly like it says on the box. Never mind that this is exactly the sort of scientific conjecture that would immediately have the luddites passing out hammers, and for good reason. Before long the world is wrecked by competing beliefs whizz-banging all over the place, a handful of charismatic messiahs squabble over the ashes, and everybody else is brainwashed into adhering to an even mix of real magic and watery televangelism.  It’s a great setting, in other words. Idiosyncratic but recognizable. Dense but not belabored. Bleak but also bleak. And it sets up a world that’s appropriately brutal, one where the average Thursday likely consists of torching a temple, summoning a monstrous avatar, and passing a collection plate. A universal church even a millennial can dig.  But it isn’t long before True Messiah makes one wonder: what’s the function of a setting at all? Some cool illustrations? Justification for why you’re warring over a charred ball of dust? Or is it something more? Is it to provide a context for your actions, perhaps? To inform what you’re doing and why, to bind mechanisms to keywords and keywords to automatic reflexive thought, to spark the imagination and even, perhaps, offer some sort of thematic statement?  In order to talk about why True Messiah doesn’t accomplish any of that, let’s open with magic.  This is a deck-builder, but not like the deck-builders you may have played before. It exists in a middle ground between, say, a pure deck-builder like Shards of Infinity, which is nothing but deck, and a hybrid game by Martin Wallace like A Study in Emerald, Mythotopia, or A Handful of Stars, where your actions are enabled and informed by a deck but played out on a map.  Here deck-building is something you get up to every so often. When you feel like it. When the market phase rolls around, and you’ve bothered to collect coins to wager, and you actually want any of the spells currently being auctioned. And your deck isn’t full of the stuff you’ll do on your turn, like raising or moving armies or starting scuffles or fundraising. Every card is a magic spell, insofar that you can call faith-based healing that actually heals because of faith “magic.” Pray hard enough — by flipping your temple-going believers onto their knees — and ding! Like a microwave announcing your flatbread pizza is lukewarm and soggy, suddenly a pious benefactor has donated to your coffers, or an enemy army has been smitten by lightning, or rival zealots lose their faith and become piddly nonbelievers.  Three things stand out about this system. The first is that it’s perfectly functional. Spells stack between players, letting you preempt an attack with a defensive spell, only to have it disrupted by another spell in response. As long as you have followers squatting in a temple, you have the currency to do something outlandish, even when it isn’t your turn. Sounds good, right? That’s what we call off-turn engagement!  Except the second thing is that these cards are generally underwhelming. Not that there aren’t some real winners in there. A pilgrimage teleports an army rather than crawling them across the dirt! Disillusionment annihilates a messiah’s ranks! Divine judgment transforms nonbelievers into burnt temples! The problem is that these cards are the exception rather than the rule, the amazing atom bombs that stand in contrast to the basic ground-pounders, with hardly any artillery making up the middle. Of course, not every deck-builder needs to provide fireworks at every turn. A Few Acres of Snow and Hands in the Sea, for example, both stuffed their decks with administrative duties alongside their canoes and elephants. But even in these cases the cards were essential decision points, things to be managed or winnowed. They elicited a response, even if that response was deliberate frustration or delay. Never a shrug.  That’s the third thing. Because these powers are neither thrilling nor integrated directly into what you’ll do on your turn, they feel weirdly divorced from the business of marching armies and constructing temples. They’re something periodically tinkered with, little movement or defense or battle bonuses, rather than indispensable tools kept always at hand.  This sense of detachment creeps into the higher-level gameplay as well. Each turn, you move six units up to two spaces, except when your messiah is out and about, in which case you’re permitted to move nine units. If your messiah calls in sick and stays at a holy site, you recruit two new followers, or one new follower for every temple with at least two followers on it. And you build temples when you have four followers in an empty space, but not if one of them has been demoted to nonbeliever status, and there’s nothing to stop you from lining the edge of the map with temples rather than spreading them out.  Is your head spinning? At every turn, True Messiah provides a possibility, then robs it of easy meaning by counterpointing it with an exception. Consider the victory conditions. If an opponent’s messiah dies, you win. That’s great! It’s concise and approachable. Your messiah is your toughest combat unit and the source of all your spells, but also vulnerable across multiple skirmishes. Where he trods, so trod death and destruction, but little by little the fray will take its toll. Straightforward stakes.  But recall that I mentioned victory conditions, plural. You also win if a rival — any rival — drops below four followers, or loses their holy city, or owns fewer than eight cards in their hand, deck, and discard. Taken on their own, any of these individual conditions would suffice. In some cases they’re even apt, like the way an overly curated deck might open itself to disruption and therefore failure. When added together, the game feels fiddly and weightless, as though victory is more about plinking at an opponent’s most overlooked digit rather than exploiting a weakness. Worse, when playing with more than two messiahs the game suffers from a terrible case of A Third Party Wins By Swooping In When Someone Is Weakened.  There are other problems, from the carved-in-granite turn order to the disappointing combat, but expounding on them isn’t necessary. Rather, the point is that True Messiah is an unfortunate reminder that not every passion project results in a fascinating artifact of talent and creativity. It’s easy to see how this might have shaped into something more coherent given some careful development, resulting in solid deck-building hybrid instead of a cotillage of mismatched and exception-riddled systems.  Sometimes a passion project results in something truly incredible. Sadly, that wasn’t the case with True Messiah.<|im_end|>

# Attorneys propose jury questions for Michael Rosfeld trial

Attorneys propose jury questions for Michael Rosfeld trial 34 minutes ago Prosecutors and defense attorneys in the homicide case against former East Pittsburgh police officer Michael Rosfeld submitted 79 questions between them that they want potential jurors to answer during jury selection next week.  Selection in the case is set to being March 12 in Dauphin County as the result of a successful defense motion for a change of venire – that is, bringing in a jury from outside of Allegheny County because of pre-trial publicity.  Rosfeld’s attorney, Patrick Thomassey, argued late last year that the extensive media coverage surrounding the June 19 shooting of Antwon Rose II.  The questions range from potential jurors’ military or law enforcement affiliation to their feelings on hand guns and police use of deadly force to hobbies and media consumption. The process, referred to as voir dire, is mean to ensure an impartial jury.  Chief Trial Deputy Daniel Fitzsimmons wants to know what social media platforms jurors use, what books and magazines they like to read, whether they are members of any clubs, and if they know that shows such as “CSI’ are dramatizations.  Both sides proposed extensive questioning of potential jurors’ feelings toward police.  “Do you believe that there are circumstances under which police officers or other public officials should not have to obey the law?” asks one question proposed by prosecutors.  Another: “Do you believe that if a person disobeys a police officer that he deserves what he gets?” and “In general, for any reason, would you have difficulty sitting in judgment of a police officer?”  Thomassey’s questions are similar.  “Do you believe that a police officer should desist from an arrest if the suspect flees?” asks one proposed by the defense.  Another: “Do you feel that a police officer is only justified in using deadly force when deadly force has been used on them?”  Rosfeld shot and killed 17-year-old Rose as he ran from a felony traffic stop in East Pittsburgh on June 19. Rosfeld shot him three times in the back.  Rose was a passenger in a car suspected in a drive-by shooting minutes before the killing in nearby North Braddock. Police say the car had gunshot damage to its rear window, likely from the earlier shooting. As Rosfeld ordered the driver to the ground, Rose and backseat passenger Zaijuan Hester fled on foot, authorities said. Hester was later arrested.  The trial is set to being in Allegheny County on March 19.  Megan Guza is a Tribune-Review staff writer. You can contact Megan at 412-380-8519, mguza@tribweb.com or via Twitter .<|im_end|>

# Girl, 16, run over leaving children's home

Girl, 16, run over leaving Cambridgeshire children's home  A 16-year-old girl was killed by a car shortly after a physical "altercation" at the children's home where she was a resident, an inquest has heard. Emma Cockerill was hit from behind on the B1167 in Thorney, Cambridgeshire, by a driver who did not see her until it was too late, a jury was told. She and a friend had left Thornberry Lodge, where she was a resident, soon after a "physical" incident with staff. The home, which was not a secure facility, closed soon afterwards. Huntingdon Law Courts heard that Emma had been placed at the home in Cambridgeshire by Warwickshire County Council, which was responsible for her care. First resident The court heard she was given a place in Thornberry Lodge, run by Archways Care, which at the time of her death had three other girls with "similar sorts of problems", according to director Chris Aristidou. The home had been set up in March 2015 and Emma was its first resident, the jury was told. The home's first manager had been sacked and it spent six to seven months with another person "stepping up" to the role in an acting capacity, Mr Aristidou said. He said that he had been at the home on 22 January 2016 where he had seen Emma and when he left in the afternoon she had not got dressed. Dark clothing He said after he left "there had been an altercation and [Emma] had gone out" after dark. The court heard she was wearing dark clothing on the unlit national speed limit road outside the property, and Mr Aristidou said residents were advised to wear hi-vis jackets. He said that as it was not a secure unit staff "couldn't physically intervene to stop someone leaving a home" - adding physical intervention would only take place if there was a "significant risk". After being hit by the car Emma was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, where she died the following morning. The inquest, expected to last five days, continues.<|im_end|>

# Trump on measles vaccination: 'They have to get the shot'

Breaking News Emails President Donald Trump on Friday urged parents to get their children vaccinated after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced this week that measles cases had reached a record high since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. "They have to get the shot. The vaccinations are so important," Trump said outside the White House on his way to Indianapolis to address the NRA. "This is really going around now, they have to get their shot." New cases of measles reported in New York, New Jersey and California bring the total number of infections in the U.S. to at least 695 so far in 2019 according to new numbers released by CDC. Nearly 300 students and employees at two Los Angeles universities were under quarantine Thursday and Friday after possible exposure to measles. Trump's comments on Friday differed from his past remarks on vaccinations. At a 2015 Republican presidential candidate debate hosted by CNN, Trump said that he wanted to change the vaccine schedule for children, erroneously linking autism to vaccines. "Autism has become an epidemic…I am totally in favor of vaccines. But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time," he said. In a March 2014 tweet, Trump questioned why a child "gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines." "Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes — AUTISM. Many such cases!" he tweeted. On Wednesday, New York City and suburban Rockland County confirmed an additional 37 measles cases, and California reported seven new cases. The second-highest number for measles cases in the U.S. was 667 in 2014, according to the CDC. In New York City and Rockland County, there have been 590 cases since the measles outbreak began in October 2018. Los Angeles reported its first five cases on Monday.<|im_end|>

# Projecting Where Trace McSorley Will Land After Day 1 of 2019 NFL Draft

It's not surprising to see the 23-year-old fall outside the top 32. He ranked as the 15th-best quarterback in this class, per B/R's Matt Miller. McSorley left Penn State as the program's all-time leader with 9,899 passing yards, 77 passing touchdowns and 30 rushing touchdowns as a quarterback. He also tied Ohio State star and Washington Redskins first-round draft pick Dwayne Haskins in Pro Football Focus' big-time throw metric last season: During the NFL scouting combine, ESPN.com's Jeff Legwold reported McSorley declined when he was asked to work out with the defensive backs because he wanted to focus on playing quarterback. McSorley told reporters he has the intangibles and talent to be a successful NFL signal-caller. "Obviously, the intangibles are a big story, a big part of who I am, but I'm a football player," he said. "I can go out and make all the throws and run really well, and because of my intangibles, I think people tend to overlook my physical attributes." McSorley had an ally in former Penn State teammate Saquon Barkley: One reason McSorley generated interest at defensive back is he's undersized for a quarterback. The Nittany Lions star measured at 6'0" and 202 pounds during the combine. When Penn State held its pro day, McSorley showed solid accuracy during his throwing session: Accuracy is one of the biggest question marks for McSorley. He was all over the place in that category in college, with just one season over 60 percent (66.5 in 2017). There is a good starter kit in McSorley's skill set for an NFL team to build around. His going to a club with an established quarterback who can mentor him for one or two years will go a long way toward getting him on the right path to being considered for a starting job. A team like the Detroit Lions would make for a solid fit. Matthew Stafford is signed through 2022, but he's also 31 years old and hasn't led them to a playoff win in three postseason appearances. If the Lions want to cut ties with Connor Cook as their backup, McSorley can step into the role immediately. They could also draft him for their third-team unit as a rookie, with the potential to elevate him to the No. 2 spot in 2020. McSorley's wait could extend to Saturday because there are still other quarterbacks available who likely rate higher than him. Teams looking for help at the position will presumably go after Missouri's Drew Lock, Auburn's Jarrett Stidham, West Virginia's Will Grier and Buffalo's Tyree Jackson in Rounds 2 and 3.<|im_end|>

# Oh, to be a Nigerian - Vanguard News

By Morenike Taire  Olajumoke Orisaguna now formally known as Olajumoke Chris was a typical deprived Nigerian from South Western Nigeria who hawked bread for a living and could barely make ends meet for her two daughters.  She was on a most ordinary mission when she found herself in the most extraordinary of circumstances. Many Nigerians, particularly the young ones are familiar with the story of how she walked into a photo shoot and got ‘discovered’ in the parlance of the international world of modelling.  Thus a jobless hairdresser became a celebratory figure with a reality show, a posh apartment and runway gigs. Olajumoke’s story is significant on the basis of acting as proof that there is such a thing as a Nigerian dream and that by providence or whatever means, an individual of lowly beginnings has a chance to alter their circumstances so significantly and so suddenly that it brings hope to the rest of the people.  In the immediate post colonial era this sort of social mobility was not at all uncommon and was in fact more defined, more definitive and less the result of luck than a certain level of technicality. Western education had just been democratized and freed from being an elite venture, due in the most part to political pioneers and patriots such as Obafemi Awolowo who deployed massive amounts of state resources to it. Children of the unlettered thus moved from the dreary prospects of lives of labour or servitude to those of ease and unprecedented prosperity.  At the Arise Fashion Weekend this Easter, an African American designer made a mention of how he considered it impressive that it is impossible, according to him, to tell the difference between a rich and poor Nigerian just by looking at them. This might seem contestable to the average Nigerian but as they say in public Relations, perception is reality. And so while we see the Nigerian dream as something that died with the era when people came from as far as Singapore and San Francisco to work and earn a Naira that was stronger than the Dollar, outsiders still troop in by the day to exploit myriad opportunities which we never see though they are right there under our noses.  With all the travel warnings their governments issue to them, with all the unflattering memos their journalists write when they return to their country, foreigners keep trooping in from all corners of the globe, mostly succeeding at their various ventures, noble or otherwise. Whether they are manufacturing plastic at the Isolo Lagos corridor or mining gold in Zamfara, foreigners keep finding a way to thrive and make themselves comfortable in this same space where Nigerians are mostly groaning, finding the Nigerian dream.  Nigeria is fast becoming the enfant terrible of the committee of Nations that everyone hates to love. Our music has seeped with little warning into the consciousness of the world; our fashion is surely following. Our food, our flair, our savoir faire is admired and craved by the whole world, including ourselves. The only thing that is hated is the space we occupy and we, the people who occupy it.  It is this state of affairs that was exploited to the hilt during the 2019 general elections, when, in the months preceeding the polls rumours were released and pushed of the president being not the president but some clone from Sudan named Jibrin or Jubril depending on the version. For some reason, this was supposed to disqualify him from the presidential race in 2019, while this Jubril continued to sit in Aso Rock in the meantime. Things were to take an even more ridiculous turn when, in the post election struggle for the presidency an earlier assertion by the Indigenous People Of Biafra, IPOB was adopted by the lead counsel to the ruling All Progressives Congress, Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, in its defense to the petition filed by former vice President and 2019 presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar to the presidential election tribunal in Abuja  It was asserted that the aggrieved candidate was born in Jada in Adamawa state, in a region which was part of Cameroon at the time. On this basis, the statement of defense claimed Atiku did not qualify to aspire to the presidency in the first place.  In a country from which hundreds successfully flee every day and thousands try and fail, it is suddenly desirable to be a Nigerian. No doubt the IPOB ideologist is having fun right now. Ensconced in a comfortable self imposed exile it is the easiest thing in the world not only to disparage all things Nigerian but also to challenge the very meaning of being Nigerian  Kanu once again explores the tired idea of citizenship by referendum; all the more tired because you get the impression that he is more afraid of a referendum than those he accuses of not wanting one.  The relationship between a country and her citizens is comparable, at the best of times to the relationship between a mother and her children. Needless to assert the relationship is a very abusive one in the Nigerian situation- a nation which, like the proverbial grasscutter suckles from the breast of its citizens rather than the other way around.  But it has not always been that way, not does it have to continue to be. A time would surely come when the Federal Inland Revenue Service FIRS would have trouble boasting openly about the trillions of Naira it has succeeded at squeezing out of Nigeria’s mostly economically disoriented citizens because the question would then be asked: what is the government giving in return?  The acute levels of tribal dissensions that we see today is not the result of severe tribal differences but economic positioning. This is what politicians milk for their own benefit.  For sure one of the truest bases for citizenship is of what a nation has done for her children. Like Mohammadu Buhari and Atiku Abubakar, Nnamdi Kanu has benefited from the finest and most cost effective, if not virtually free Nigerian education. If anything makes them all Nigerians, this surely does.  Kanu’s attempt to hijack the citizenship conversation must not be allowed. It’s not a conversation for intellectuals and idealists alone but for every Nigerian, including seekers of referendum, particularly those interested in redefining their relationship with this wicked nation- to close their eyes to tribe and open them to opportunity<|im_end|>

# Lakewood Eagle Ridge development plan can go forward, judge says

Lakewood's Eagle Ridge Golf Club: Judge decides development can go forward Tanya Breen, @tanyabreenphoto TOMS RIVER - A judge here has denied a last-minute request to further postpone a proposal to build 500 to 1,000 residences on a Lakewood Township golf course, a ruling that clears the controversial plan to be considered by planning officials Tuesday. Ocean County Superior Court Judge Marlene Lynch Ford ruled Monday after a 40-minute hearing that there was no legal basis for her to preempt The Parke at Lakewood from seeking approval from the Lakewood Township Planning Board. The Parke, an affiliate of GDMS Holdings LLC, has submitted an application to build a combined residential and retail complex on what is now Eagle Ridge Golf Club in the township's southwest corner. The planning board is slated to consider the project at 6 p.m. Tuesday at the municipal building, 231 Third St. in Lakewood. Residents of The Fairways at Lake Ridge, an age-restricted community that borders the golf course, have emerged as vocal opponents to the plan and have filed two lawsuits against the developer and the township over its 2017 planning process. Last month, the judge sided with the residents and temporarily halted the planning board from hearing The Parke's proposal because the residents' lawyer, Michele Donato, was out of town. Donato and about a dozen Fairways residents returned to court Monday asking the judge to grant them more time, but their request was denied. Paul H. Schneider, who represents the developer and landowner, said in court that the residents seeking an injunction were merely trying to delay a municipal approval process that is in its early stages. "Even if we were to assume it was granted (by the planning board), you couldn't put shovels in the ground," Schneider told the judge. The item before the planning board is a general development plan; Schneider said the developer would also have to get subdivision and site plan approvals before any work could begin. It's unclear how long that process could take. Donato asked the judge to extend the prior injunction so Donato could argue that a ruling in a separate but related case should be overturned. In that related case, the landowner, Augusta Holdings LLC, challenged and overturned a township ordinance that made non-age-restricted development at Eagle Ridge contingent upon road improvements coming first. Arguably, it is one of the most hotly debated components of the township's master plan. Donato said she was not given proper notice that the related case had been filed or adjudicated. "It's like pulling the rug out from someone and saying, 'now, stand,'" Donato said. John Jackson, attorney for the township planning board, said the proper course of action was for residents to file an appeal after the planning board decision. Even before that can happen, Donato promised to raise her concerns at Tuesday night's planning board meeting. Construction at Eagle Ridge is a flash point in the ongoing debate over how Lakewood Township should grow. Stay up-to-date on the latest developments with a subscription to the Asbury Park Press.

# Roy Moore, Leigh Corfman reach deal on deposition terms

Three weeks after issuing a press release headlined “Where is Leigh Corfman?” the issue over when Roy Moore’s accuser would sit for a deposition has been resolved. Attorneys for both sides agreed during a hearing in Montgomery on Monday morning that Moore would complete his nearly-finished deposition and then Corfman would give hers in the defamation lawsuit she brought 14 months ago against the 2017 U.S. Senate candidate.  That resolution fell in line with the position stated by Corfman's lawyers in court filings, who maintained that Moore should answer the final questions in a deposition largely completed in October. After that point, their client would answer questions from Moore's attorneys. Moore's team had expressed concerns that Corfman would tailor her answers to Moore's. But Corfman's attorneys have repeatedly said she will have no advance knowledge of Moore's testimony.  The bulk of the hearing lingered into the figurative legal argument weeds as Moore's attorneys presented their case orally to Montgomery County Circuit Judge John Rochester to supplement their motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Neither Moore nor Corfman attended the hearing. Rochester listened to lawyers from both sides make their cases but did not issue an immediate ruling. However, he said that granting a motion to dismiss is a rare occurrence unless a defendant presents a "compelling" case. Rochester then said he was sure that Moore's attorneys believed they had presented such a case. Moore's lawyers emphasized that their client never attacked Corfman, who told The Washington Post in a story published a month before the Dec. 12, 2017 Senate election that Moore had made unwanted sexual advances when she was 14 and he was 32.  Moore has repeatedly denied the accusations. "All you can do is deny it," Moore attorney Julian McPhillips told the judge. "All of a sudden, you can be sued because you denied it." Corfman's lawsuit, which makes no specific requests for money and seeks a public apology from Moore, focused on Moore use of the phrase "false and malicious" when describing Corfman's allegations. That statement was made in a lawsuit Moore filed soon after the narrow election win by Doug Jones in an effort to stop the process of making the results official. "He says he doesn't know her from Adam's housecat," McPhillips said. Corfman attorney Jeffrey Doss said that the lawsuit spells out defamatory statements against Corfman not only from Moore but also representatives of his Senate campaign and, in turn, from the public. Doss also said that Moore's denials went beyond what was necessary and suggested that all Moore needed to do was to say he did not know Corfman and her accusations were not true. Moore and his campaign, Doss said, went "above and beyond mere denial." In discussion about Corfman's request for the judge to enter a "declaratory judgment" against Moore and require his apology, Rochester said he did not see how a sincere apology could be demanded from Moore.  No trial date has been set for the case.<|im_end|>

# Behind the Top 100: Around the World with Bach’s Cello Suites

This year, we’re taking you “Behind the Top 100”, spotlighting select pieces on KUSC’s Top 100 Countdown with fun and informative blogs about the music you love. Can Bach’s Suites for Solo Cello change the world?  “I believe that culture – the way we express ourselves and understand each other – is an essential part of building a strong society. My hope is that together we can use Bach’s music to start a bigger conversation about the culture of us”. 
– Yo-Yo Ma – Yo-Yo Ma 
 Yo-Yo Ma is spending two years traveling the world to prove the power of music to bring people together. The vehicles for his creative message are the six Cello Suites of Johann Sebastian Bach, which he is currently performing in concert halls, paired with what he calls “a day of action” in each city or town, bringing Bach’s music to schools, and community centers, and other non-traditional “concert halls”.  Yo-Yo Ma | Photo by Todd Rosenberg Photography  The Cellos Suite No. 1 has landed at #64 on The KDFC Classical All-Stars Top 100 list (after coming in at #100 last year!) – and it’s no wonder what with all the attention given to Yo-Yo Ma’s third new recording of them, and his highly publicized world tour!  Under the heading “Culture Connects Us”, Ma and his team asked artists from 36 countries to send in a video showing how they express themselves and help to bring their community together. In the video, you can see musicians and dancers, gardeners, cooks, weavers, soccer players, and paddle boarders from Argentina to Uzbekistan, Japan, Portugal, the US, South Africa and more.  Of course, Yo-Yo Ma isn’t the only musician drawn to the Cello Suites. Pablo Casals was 13 years old when he came across the mostly unknown published manuscript of Bach’s suites in a second-hand shop in Barcelona in 1890. He began performing them publicly in 1901, made the first ever recording in the 1930s, and essentially showed the world that these seemingly simple “student exercises” invited much deeper listening.  And not so long ago, Bach’s music joined the modern musical world:  Only time will tell where Bach’s Cello Suites will take us next.<|im_end|>

# Barron's: The International Monetary Fund downgrades its 2019 forecast as economic pessimism grows

Mounting geopolitical headwinds have intensified fears of an oncoming economic recession, especially as the nation’s housing market, which is a significant indicator of overall economic health, has slowed to concerning levels.  The International Monetary Fund, which is a global organization consisting of 189 countries working to sustain financial stability, asked the opinions of 307 insurance company executives in an annual survey conducted by Goldman Sachs’ asset management division.  The survey discovered that 35% of these leaders said an economic slowdown and U.S. recession was their top worry, citing growth concerns as a top risk to their investment portfolios, according to Cobley.  From the article:   More than four-fifths of them, 82%, said they expected this to happen in either 2020 or 2021. But US recession is “not a 2019 event”, Goldman said, with only 2% of its respondents predicting economic reversal for this year.  And these insurers may be right, as the latest Gross Domestic Product report produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis determined real GDP increased at an annual rate of 3.2% in the first quarter of 2019.  However, if GDP does not maintain its momentum The Federal Reserve could take action, potentially resulting in the adjustment of interest rates.  This could prove to be detrimental as insurers tend to put the majority of their money into bonds, according to Cobley. From the article:   This year, the proportion nervous of further rate rises slumped to just 7%, while those worrying about bad debts jumped to 38%. This was “particularly notable” among US insurance companies, Goldman noted, half of which picked “credit quality deterioration” as their top investment risk.  Goldman’s researchers wrote: “This year’s results indicate that respondents are the least optimistic they’ve been since 2015.” Only 14% of the insurance chiefs said their investment opportunities were improving, down from 18% last year and 23% in 2017.<|im_end|>

# Green water supplies and global limits

Access to dwindling freshwater supplies is one of the defining issues of our time as global populations expand amidst a changing climate. Water access and limitations and related issues are rightly considered a possible flashpoint for global conflict; they also represent a major cause of concern from environmental and ecological perspectives as well as a global security standpoint. Water availability in terms of "blue water"—that is, precipitation in the form of free flowing surface water run-off and groundwater—has been well documented in in the existing scientific literature. "Green water" limits however—green water being precipitation that is captured by plants or biomass and recirculated back into the atmosphere via evapotranspiration (ET) or bound up in soil—have thus far received scant attention by researchers. The distinction between blue and green water in understanding water scarcity is far from trivial, since green water represents the greater part of water use by human populations.  Reporting in PNAS, a Dutch-American team has contributed a significant study with far-reaching policy implications. The study successfully differentiates green water use from blue while offering a regional and country-by-country analysis of green water use in terms of natural and human services, and the interplay of existing and potential limitations between the two. Typical human appropriations of green water supplies include uses such as growing food and fiber crops, timber, and bioenergy resources, and raising livestock. Increasingly, however, these human land uses come at the expense of natural systems and the ecosystem services they provide to human and non-human communities alike.  Joep Schyns and colleagues sought to answer three principal questions with their study: "What is the appropriation of green water by the human economy, specified geographically? What are the geographically explicit limits to the human appropriation of green water? Where are these limits approached or exceeded?"  To answer these questions, the researchers first defined a green water footprint (WFg) in terms of timber production, agriculture, urban areas, etc, at a 5 x 5 arc-minute resolution of spatial cells. Next, they quantified the maximum sustainable WFg (WFg,m ) as the total available green water flow less the green water flow to be preserved for natural systems. In establishing a measure of WFg,m, the study authors took into consideration factors such as agroecological accessibility and biodiversity conservation needs. Biodiversity conservation needs here were based on criteria from the Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, which stipulates a protected area of at least 17% of lands globally. Finally, Schyns and company assessed green water allocation by way of human activities versus natural services in order to determine whether human activities were approaching or had already overshot the WFg,m at the level of each 5 x 5 cell. For this, they calculated green water scarcity (WSg) at the country-wide level as the ratio of the national aggregate WFg to the national aggregate WFg,m.  They found that 56% of the sustainably available global green water flow has already been allocated for human purposes, though at the regional level the WFg-to-WFg,m ratio varied dramatically. Areas such as Scandinavia, Canada, Africa and elsewhere, for example, had not yet approached WFg,m , whereas other regions such as Central Europe, South Asia, the Middle East, and Central America were fast approaching or had already overshot WFg,m. And just 10 nations, the investigators found, accounted for more than half of the overshoot: "United States (8.6%), Brazil (6.9%), Indonesia (6.4%), India (5.2%), China (5.0%), Colombia (4.9%), Philippines (4.4%), Mexico (4.0%), Germany (3.1%), and Malaysia (2.5%)."  Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, countries with seemingly ample rainfall such as Germany, the UK and New Zealand showed high WSg, where green water resources were already fully or almost fully allocated to human activities. In the case of Germany, the researchers point out, vast sections of land have been converted to monoculture production of rapeseed to meet that country's sustainable energy goals. This, in turn, is believed to be responsible for the decline of flying insects even within protected areas of Germany. Biofuels production has led to similar consequences in the US.  The destruction of rainforests, mainly in the Global South, is largely driven by commodity production pressures to expand into lands with adequate rainfall thus far unused by humans, at the expense of major biodiversity loss. Activities such as cattle ranching and crop production for feed and biofuels are driving expansion into the forests and grasslands of South America, while logging and conversion to palm oil plantations are major threats to lands in Southeast Asia. These areas are hotspots on the water scarcity map too. As the study authors ominously note, "The tensions between green water for humans versus nature are intensifying as the green water demand for biomass in the economy grows. This growth is not only driven by population growth, but also by increasing green water demands per capita due to changes in the food and energy mix."  Aside from policy measures to slow down the human WFg–- particularly those directed against the consumption of resource-intensive livestock and the use of biofuels –- there are steps that can be taken to improve green water productivity: for example, improving the water-holding capacity of soils through no-till agriculture or the application of mulches to slow evaporation. Beneficial blue water flows however may be impacted by improved soil management techniques, and blue and green water flows are ultimately interrelated and communicating systems, both of which are ultimately dependent on precipitation. Stress resistant crop cultivars that are well adapted to water-scarce conditions are another possible adaptation to limited green water flows.  The historical decisions regarding green water use for human purposes versus natural purposes have mostly favored human endeavors at the expense of natural habitats and biodiversity. But even in characterizing these decisions as "trade-offs" of the human versus the natural, the study investigators cite "trillions of dollars in losses of ecosystem service values" owing to the human allocation of green water resources. Thusly, they conclude: "The world's limited green water flow is shared by human society and nature. By ignoring limits to human's [sic] growing WFg––driven by an increased demand for food, feed, fiber, timber, and bioenergy––we risk further loss of ecosystem service values. Green water is a critical and limited resource that should explicitly be part of any assessment of water scarcity, food security, or bioenergy potential." Explore further: Ramped up efforts needed to protect the world's inland waters

# Youth citizen of the year announced - Maple Ridge News

The Maple Ridge Community Foundation is again recognizing outstanding citizens with its annual awards, and Saturday announced their second annual youth citizen of the year.  In a ceremony at Thomas Haney Secondary, Victoria Gardner was recognized as this year’s winner.  Gardner stood out for her contributions at her school, Garibaldi secondary, over the past five years. She has been a leading member of the Link Crew, Key Club, Student Government, model UN, Garibaldi Student Action Team and Rebels for a Cause.  She is also a community volunteer, who offers her time at Ridge Meadows Hospital, the Child Development Centre and with Special Olympics.  “Victoria inspires her peers to be resourceful, active and kind,” said her nomination.  Three finalists were honoured on Saturday, and Elijah Wootton was nominated as a key member of the Greg Moore Youth Centre Youth Council. He also got involved in the development of the Thomas Haney Action (Skate) Park.  “Elijah also volunteers his time as a youth mentor to ensure the skate park is safe, free of drugs and alcohol and accessible to everyone,” said the nomination. “He is a role model that children and youth look up to.”  Vienna Zivin is a leader with the First Abion Scouts, which has led to many volunteer opportunities. She has held numerous volunteer roles in school, including fitness leadership, mural committee and the Grade 7 leaving ceremony committee. She also encourages others to volunteer with her.  “Vienna is described as a philanthropic, kind youth who regularly donates her gently used items to charitable organizations, or friends and other youth whom she knows has little.”  Up on stage to present Gardner with her award was nine-year-old Ryder Moore, the winner of last year’s youth award for his Ryder’s Rainboots charitable initiative.  The foundation’s citizen of the year youth committee was co-chaired by Phil Bourque and Roger Cummings.  “We had six really strong candidates this year,” said Bourque, and noted the three finalists all receive a certificate.  As the winner, Gardner receives a $750 donation in her name toward a local charity of her choice. Gardner chose the Family Education Support Centre.  On May 11 the Citizen of the Year awards for Lifetime Achievement and Under-40 categories will take place at foundation’s annual fundraising dinner at the Meadow Gardens Golf Club.<|im_end|>

# More Small, Midsized Firms Choose To Pay Workers’ Medical Costs Directly

Instead of buying a health insurance policy to cover their workers, a growing number of small and midsized companies are opting to pay their employees’ medical claims directly, a potentially riskier practice financially called self-insuring, a recent study found.  Between 2013 and 2015, the proportion of midsized companies with 100 to 499 employees that were self-insured increased 19 percent, to 30.1 percent, according to the analysis published in July by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. The percentage of small firms with fewer than 100 employees that self-funded their health plans grew 7 percent, to 14.2 percent, the study found. Meanwhile, self-funding by large companies declined slightly, to 80.4 percent.  For the study, researchers analyzed survey data from nearly 40,000 employers that participated in the U.S. Census Bureau’s Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance/Employer Component.  “The expectation was the Affordable Care Act would drive more midsized and smaller employers in this direction,” said Paul Fronstin, director of EBRI’s health research and education program. “I think it’s interesting that what we expected to see is finally showing up.”  Starting in 2014, the health law imposed new coverage and cost requirements on health plans. But some of the changes don’t apply to companies that self-fund. For example, policies sold to companies in the small group market — in most states, defined as companies with fewer than 50 workers — are required to cover 10 so-called essential health benefits and are restricted in how much they can raise premiums based on age or tobacco use. Self-funded plans don’t have to comply with those requirements. They also avoid most federal and state taxes on health plan premiums to health insurers.  Most large companies self-fund their health plans rather than buy policies from insurers. Doing so gives them more flexibility to tailor their benefits for their workforce, and to reduce their total outlay because they don’t have to absorb marketing and other costs that are built into health insurers’ products. (For workers, the coverage generally appears no different whether a company self-insures or buys insurance.)  But any savings a company might achieve come with financial risks. Employers that self-fund typically buy stop-loss insurance to protect them if employees have higher-than-expected health care claims. But such coverage isn’t guaranteed and may only be available to firms with healthier employees, said John Arensmeyer, CEO of the Small Business Majority, an advocacy group that focuses on companies with fewer than 100 workers.  “Our concern is, is it really appropriate for a business of that size to be taking the risk?” Arensmeyer said. “They’re simply taking themselves out of the rules of the ACA, creating an imbalance in the market.”  Please contact Kaiser Health News to send comments or ideas for future topics for the Insuring Your Health column.<|im_end|>

# Dr. Elaine Heffner: An early Head Start

The current goal of providing public school preschool programs for 3-year-old’s can actually be traced to the work of Edward Zigler who died last month. A Professor Emeritus of Psychology at Yale University, he was well known as the “Father of Head Start.” Throughout his career he worked to better the lives of children and families and pioneered in applying an understanding of developmental psychology to public policy.  One of the original architects of Head Start, Zigler was an initial planner of the program during the Johnson Administration’s War on Poverty, a program that has since served 35 million families. His concept of a comprehensive early childhood program came naturally to Zigler who considered himself an “original Head Starter.”  The son of immigrants, Zigler was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, where as a young child he attended an immigrant settlement house program where he and his family learned English and received health care, meals and social supports. This experience led him to believe that young children are best prepared to learn when their health and social/emotional needs are met and their parents are involved in their schooling. His ongoing research brought attention to the importance of meaningful family involvement and the essential role of parents in the lives of their children.  The daily life importance of the social supports to families meaningful to Zigler in his life are worth noting in the appraisal of Head Start in the years since its inception. Praised initially as one of the programs introduced by Johnson to lift people from poverty, Head Start was meant to provide for low income children the kind of early life exposure to learning afforded those of means.  Somewhat expansive and unrealistic goals were then set such as improving school readiness for children in the program, improving children’s cognitive, social and emotional development, and communication skills. As the first groups moved from Head Start to grade school, the criticism offered was that the gains the children made in these areas while in the program, were not sustained as children moved forward academically.  Academic outcomes have been reevaluated over the years with varying results. As in the education system generally, the push toward early introduction of academics infected Head Start programs as well as the private preschool world. This meant an intensification of the goal that Head Start ready children for grade school entry. An experienced, long time Head Start teacher said in a recent conversation, “It’s that American love of numbers,” meaning achievement ratings.  What gets lost in the discussion of outcomes is the meaning of the program to the children and families served. The teacher quoted above talked about the families in her program, the number of single mothers working to support their children, the lack of affordable child care and what their lives and the lives of their children would be like without the program. She described a father visiting and crying upon hearing his daughter sing with the group - he had never heard her sing before.  In the 1970s, Ziegler collaborated on a bill to provide affordable child care for working families with fees based on income. It was approved by Congress but then vetoed by President Richard Nixon, who was overwhelmed by mail from those opposed to women working outside the home, raising the fear that children would be raised in centers rather than by their mothers. These same objections were initially raised to Head Start.  Ongoing conflict over women at work continues to pervade public policy and the lack of social supports that would improve the lives of families. Elaine Heffner, LCSW, Ed.D., has written for Parents Magazine, Fox.com, Redbook, Disney online and PBS Parents, as well as other publications. She has appeared on PBS, ABC, Fox TV and other networks. Dr. Heffner is the author of “Goodenoughmothering: The Best of the Blog,” as well as “Mothering: The Emotional Experience of Motherhood after Freud and Feminism.” She is a psychotherapist and parent educator in private practice, as well as a senior lecturer of education in psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Heffner was a co-founder and served as director of the Nursery School Treatment Center at Payne Whitney Clinic, New York Hospital. And she blogs at goodenoughmothering.com.<|im_end|>

# How to Make Friends on a Cruise - World of Cruising Magazine

Part of the fun of cruising is the people we meet – from the funny, outgoing types who keep us entertained to the quiet, interesting ones who teach us a thing or two about life. Even the annoying types give us something to gossip or laugh about, while the nicest ones can become friends for years, or sometimes, even partners.  At least, that’s the theory. But stepping aboard a cruise ship among literally thousands of strangers can be a daunting experience, especially for those of you who are solo travellers. So, what’s the secret of meeting people and making friends? Well, fortunately you’re already in the right place.  “By its very nature, a cruise is a sociable holiday,” says Gill Hasson, author of Confidence Handbook. ‘Nobody gets on board thinking: “I’m going to keep myself to myself and stay in my cabin all week.”’  When it comes to making friends on a cruise, life coach Becki Houlston also believes it’s easier than people think. “Just being there gives everyone something in common. So, get on board with a positive, easy-going attitude, and there’s no reason why you can’t disembark with a bunch of brand new friends.”  With that advice in mind, here’s our guide on how to make friends on a cruise.  Small Talk  The first step is often the hardest, says Gill Hasson, but the key is to start small. “You could introduce yourself to someone while you’re both queuing at the buffet or relaxing by the pool.” Just say: ‘Isn’t this an amazing ship?’ Then follow up by asking if this is their first cruise, or where they’re from and whether they had to stay over in Southampton before getting on board.”  It won’t be the most scintillating conversation but, it doesn’t have to be. What matters is that you’ve made a start and shown that you’re friendly.  “Ask questions but share a bit of yourself, too, so there is some give-and-take,” says Gill. “That way you’ll soon find some common ground, and the conversation will develop. Then next time you see them you can ask about their day. If you get on well, that might lead to having a drink together, or sharing an excursion.”  Listen Up  Good listeners make good friends – but most of us could do it better, especially when meeting new people.  “There is more to listening than simply not talking,” says Becki Houlston. “Listening means really hearing what the other person is saying, rather than thinking about what we can ask next, or what stories we can tell about ourselves.  “Listen with your eyes too – don’t look over the other person’s shoulder to see who’s just come into the bar, or down at your phone to see who’s sent you a message. Make someone feel they matter to you, and then they will want to be your friend.”  Don’t Latch On  When you arrive at an onboard gathering such as a wine tasting or even just the dining room for dinner, it’s always worth taking a little time to scope out the scene, advises Gill Hasson.  “There’s a tendency to latch on to the first person you meet, but that can appear a little needy,” she says. “Instead, find somewhere to sit with a drink, where you can people-watch. Don’t look as though you’re trying to hide in a corner – have a friendly expression on your face and let people approach you. When someone asks if they can sit in the next seat, you can strike up a conversation and take it from there.”  Take a Class  Conversation is easy when there’s common ground – and on a cruise ship there is one sure-fire way to find it.  “Join a class and you’ll automatically be among like-minded people,” says seasoned cruiser Susan Clarke, a mum of two from London. “It might be star-gazing or something academic, or a dance class. It doesn’t really matter what you choose – the point is that you’re all beginners together, and the whole set-up encourages you to make friends.”  Attending a regular class also means you’ll see the same faces again and again – never a given when there are 4,500 other people on board – so once a friendship gets going, it’s easy to build it up. The next stage is to suggest you have dinner together or even to join you on one of the shore excursions one day – it’s that simple.  Don’t Rush In  When you arrive at an onboard gathering such as a wine tasting or even just the dining room for dinner, it’s always worth taking a little time to scope out the scene, advises Gill Hasson.  “There’s a tendency to latch on to the first person you meet, but that can appear a little needy,” she says. “Instead, find somewhere to sit with a drink, where you can people-watch. Don’t look as though you’re trying to hide in a corner – have a friendly expression on your face and let people approach you.  “When someone asks if they can sit in the next seat, you can strike up a conversation and take it from there.”  The Social Network  Thanks to Facebook and WhatsApp, making new friends is a whole lot easier than it used to be. “Before you set sail, check if there’s a social media group for your voyage,” suggests Anna Reay, a professional singer who has been performing on cruise ships for the past 16 years.  “People are more open about themselves online, so you quickly get an idea of who they are. If you like what you read, why not suggest meeting for coffee as soon as you get on board?”  Time to Move On  If you’ve tried to strike up a friendship with a fellow cruiser and they’ve rebuffed you, don’t let it spoil your holiday, says Gill. “There could be any number of reasons for their reaction,” she suggests.  “We don’t know what’s going on in other people’s lives. Maybe they’ve just had a row with their partner, or perhaps they simply aren’t as sociable as you are. Either way, just smile and make friends with someone else.”<|im_end|>

# Lankan Forces Raid Town With Blasts Suspects, Gunfight Breaks Out

Sri Lankan police are trying to track down 140 people believed linked to ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the Easter Sunday suicide bombings that killed 253, as shooting erupted in the east during a raid. Muslims in Sri Lanka were urged to pray at home after the State Intelligence Services warned of possible car bomb attacks, amid fears of retaliatory violence. And the U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka urged its citizens to avoid places of worship over the weekend after authorities reported there could be more attacks targeting religious centres. Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith told reporters he had seen a leaked internal security document warning of further attacks on churches and there would be no Catholic masses this Sunday anywhere on the island. The streets of Colombo were deserted on Friday evening, with many people leaving offices early amid tight security after the suicide bombing attacks on three churches and four hotels that also wounded about 500 people. President Maithripala Sirisena told reporters some Sri Lankan youths had been involved with ISIS since 2013. He said information uncovered so far suggested there were 140 people in Sri Lanka involved in ISIS activities. "Police are looking to arrest them," Sirisena said. Nearly 10,000 soldiers were deployed across the Indian Ocean island state to carry out searches and provide security for religious centres, the military said on Friday. The All Ceylon Jamiyathul Ullama, Sri Lanka's main Islamic religious body, urged Muslims to conduct prayers at home in case "there is a need to protect family and properties". Illustrating the tension that has gripped the country, shooting erupted between security forces and a group of men in the east during a search and cordon operation, a military spokesman said. The raid took place in the town of Ampara Sainthamaruthu near Batticaloa. The spokesman said there was an explosion in the area and when soldiers went to investigate they were fired upon. No details of casualties were immediately available. Police have detained at least 76 people, including foreigners from Syria and Egypt, in their investigations so far. ISIS provided no evidence to back its claim that it was behind the attacks. If true, it would be one of the worst attacks carried out by the group outside Iraq and Syria. The extremist group released a video on Tuesday showing eight men, all but one with their faces covered, standing under a black ISIS flag and declaring their loyalty to its leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. Defence, police chiefs quit The government said nine homegrown, well-educated suicide bombers carried out the attacks, eight of whom had been identified. One was a woman. Authorities have so far focused their investigations on international links to two domestic Islamist groups - National Thawheed Jama'ut and Jammiyathul Millathu Ibrahim - they believe carried out the attacks. Government officials have acknowledged a major lapse in not widely sharing an intelligence warning from India before the attacks. Sirisena said top defence and police chiefs had not shared information with him about the impending attacks. Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando resigned over the failure to prevent the attacks. "The police chief said he will resign now," Sirisena said. He blamed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's government for weakening the intelligence system by focusing on the prosecution of military officers over alleged war crimes during a decade-long civil war with Tamil separatists that ended in 2009. Sirisena fired Wickremesinghe in October over political differences, only to reinstate him weeks later under pressure from the Supreme Court. Opposing factions aligned to Wickremesinghe and Sirisena have often refused to communicate with each other and blame any setbacks on their opponents, government sources say. Cardinal Ranjith said that the church had been kept in the dark about intelligence warning of attacks. "We didn't know anything. It came as a thunderbolt for us," he said. The Easter Sunday bombings shattered the relative calm that had existed in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka since the civil war against mostly Hindu ethnic Tamil separatists ended. Sri Lanka's 22 million people include minority Christians, Muslims and Hindus. Until now, Christians had largely managed to avoid the worst of the island's conflict and communal tensions. Most of the victims were Sri Lankans, although authorities said at least 38 foreigners were also killed, many of them tourists sitting down to breakfast at top-end hotels when the bombers struck. They included British, U.S., Australian, Turkish, Indian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch and Portuguese nationals. Britain warned its nationals on Thursday to avoid Sri Lanka unless it was absolutely necessary. Fears of retaliatory sectarian violence have already caused Muslim communities to flee their homes amid bomb scares, lockdowns and security sweeps. But at the Kollupitiya Jumma Masjid mosque, tucked away in a Colombo side street, hundreds attended a service they say was focused on a call for people of all religions to help return peace to Sri Lanka. "It's a very sad situation," said 28-year-old sales worker Raees Ulhaq, as soldiers hurried on dawdling worshippers and sniffer dogs nosed their way through pot-holed lanes. "We work with Christians, Buddhists, Hindus. It has been a threat for all of us because of what these few people have done to this beautiful country."

# General Electric: Is A Dilutive Event Next?

Last week General Electric (GE) filed a shelf registration that will allow the company to offer senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, common stock and warrants. GE intends to use the proceeds from the sale of securities for general corporate purposes. Such purposes include, but are not limited to, repayment of debt acquisitions, additions to working capital, capital expenditures and investments in subsidiaries.  Description Of Debt Securities  The debt securities will be either senior or subordinated debt. The company may issue debt securities at any time in one or more series under the indentures. GE is currently authorized to issue up to 13.2 billion shares of common stock. As of Jan. 31, 2019, GE had 8.7 billion of common stock outstanding. Warrants may be issued independently or together with GE's debt securities, common stock or preferred stock and may be attached to or separate from any offered debt securities. The warrants also may be traded separately from other securities. General Electric Appears Thirsty For Capital  I have been bearish on GE for a while. My general thesis was that after trillions in stimulus from central bankers the global economy would eventually peak and GE's industrial businesses would falter. In Q4 2018 Moody's downgraded GE's senior unsecured debt two notches from A2 to Baa1. Moody's cited the "adverse impact on GE's cash flows from the deteriorating performance of Power." Moody's suggested another downgrade could be forthcoming if GE did not meet certain metrics pertaining to cash flow and debt/EBITDA.  The downgrade piqued my interest because GE had historically been known for its pristine credit quality. A downgrade likely signaled the company was worse off than I had imagined. That said, the company has been hiving off assets for a while. In 2016 the company merged its oil and gas operations with Baker Hughes (BHGE) and took a majority stake in the combined entity. The merger came as earnings at GE Oil & Gas were in free fall due to a decline in E&P and volatile oil prices.  GE has since hived off Transportation and part of Healthcare with the $21 billion sale of GE Biopharma to Danaher (DHR). The sizeable deal for Biopharma could allow GE to forgo an IPO of its Healthcare operations. The sale also would allow GE to make a sizable dent in its debt load. At Q4 2018, GE's total debt load was $110 billion, down from about $115 billion at Q3. A $21 billion payment on its debt (assumes no tax leakage) would reduce debt by more than 15%.  The Biopharma sale could also represent a de-facto equity raise:   The implied 2019E EBITDA for GE Biopharma is around $1.3 billion. Assuming debt/EBITDA of 4x is appropriate to warrant investment grade status, then the extra capital from a sale beyond 4x EBITDA could be considered a de-facto equity raise. In this example, GE needed to sell GE Biopharma for at least $5 billion (about 4x EBITDA). The sale of $21 billion exceeded the threshold by about 16 billion, which could be considered a de-facto equity raise. I have been adamant that GE needed new equity to shore up its capital base. I previously estimated (1) GE's total debt was at a 7x run-rate EBITDA and (2) to reduce debt/EBITDA down to levels suggested by Moody's would require more than $35 of additional capital. If the Biopharma deal represents a de-facto equity raise of over $15 billion, then GE may need to raise another $15 billion in equity to hit certain debt/EBITDA targets.  Culp never intimated what GE's debt/EBITDA would be after the sale of Transportation or GE Biopharma. Assuming a $21 billion pare down (assumes no tax leakage) and a loss of Biopharma's $1.3 billion estimated EBITDA, I believe GE's debt/EBITDA would still imply junk status. GE likely needs more equity to help pare debt and the shelf registration could give the company the flexibility it needs to raise equity in the future.  An issuance of common stock could be dilutive, but it also could help pare debt without foregoing future earnings like an asset sale would. An issuance of preferred stock would pare debt and lower GE's debt/EBITDA. However, preferred stock dividends would likely not be tax deductible - such dividends could hurt GE's future cash flows. The company also could issue warrants attached to debt or preferred stock issuance. GE could potentially convince investors to take a lower interest or coupon payment on debt or preferred stock in exchange for a sweetener in the future in the form of warrants. Such warrants (if exercised) could create dilution some time in the future.  Asset Sales Do Not Solve GE's Litany Of Issues  In addition to its highly-leveraged capital structure, GE has a litany of issues. Its core Power business is in disarray. In Q4 2018 Power's revenue fell Y/Y by 25% and suffered a pretax loss of more than $600 million. Its diminution will likely continue as the power industry is currently being disrupted by alternative energy sources. At year-end 2017 the company's pension plan was underfunded by over $25 billion. I understand that certain of its pension obligations will be transferred to buyers that were party to GE's asset sales. The current status of GE's underfunded pension plan and timing of future funding obligations have not been divulged. However, pension obligations could be a drag on cash flow for years to come.  GE Capital ("GECC") also is a potential problem. The finance arm currently does not make money. When GE abandoned its commercial paper program it may have caused GECC's funding costs to spike, hampering its ability to make money in the future. UBS analyst Steven Winoker believes GECC could have negative value. Management plans to make $3 billion in capital contributions to GECC in 2019 to shore up the unit's capital base. At a minimum, GECC could be a drag on cash flow. The worst-case scenario is that it's a black hole.  Conclusion  GE's asset sales have helped pare debt and given GE bulls hope for the future. However, GE remains highly indebted, its pension plan remains underfunded, Power remains in disarray and GECC remains under-capitalized. To help cure some of these issues the company likely needs a major equity raise. Its recent shelf registration could give the company the flexibility to raise more equity. A dilutive event could be on the horizon. Sell GE.  Disclosure: I am/we are short GE. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<|im_end|>

# Study: Kentucky 9th worst state to be rich from tax perspective

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WHAS11) – Americans have just over a month before the tax filing deadline and a new study shows Kentucky is the 9th worst state to be rich from a tax perspective. The Wallet Hub Study focused on people in different income tax brackets and where they spent the most and least on taxes. As it turns out, Kentucky is one of the worst states for high-income earners who pay ten percent in taxes.  Indiana is on the opposite end of the spectrum – they are one of 5 worst states to earn a low income. For more information on that study, click here.<|im_end|>

# ‘Very difficult and trying time’: Man admits to deadly shooting in Mississauga neighbourhood

A man has admitted to being the gunman in two Mississauga shootings, one of them fatal.  Richard Chambers, 31, of Innisfil, who was charged with second-degree murder in the Oct. 2, 2018 shooting death of Dorren Campbell, 30, of Mississauga, Tuesday afternoon (March 5) pleaded guilty to manslaughter in front of Justice Bruce Durno in Brampton court.  Campbell was shot inside a Malton townhouse at 7475 Goreway Dr. around 5:45 p.m. He was driven to an Etobicoke hospital where he later died.  Chambers also pleaded guilty for his role in a nightclub shooting on Northwest Drive back on Sept. 22. No one was injured in that incident in which several shots were fired around 4 a.m.  By pleading guilty to manslaughter, Chambers spares himself the mandatory life sentence in prison that would have come with a murder conviction, according to well-known Peel criminal lawyer Gary Batasar, who represented Chambers.  “While I am gratified that the murder charge was dropped against my client because it is the correct thing in a law, it’s still a very difficult and trying time for all parties that are involved in this case in particular the family of the victim, Mr. Campbell,” he said. “After much discussion, review of the evidence, analysis and assessment of the law, I came to the conclusion that this in fact was not a murder that was planned or intentional but rather a manslaughter which does not carry with it the moral blameworthiness that a murder would.”  Court heard the two men, Chambers and Campbell, were among a group of people in a parking lot when an argument ensued and the gun went off.  Chambers has accepted his responsibility for his crime and expressed his remorse, Batasar said.  Other than the same gunman being involved, there is no connection to the two shootings, Batasar added,  The sentencing hearing takes place March 11.

# Xabi Alonso reportedly ready to announce retirement from football at end of season

Reports in Germany have suggested that Spanish legend Xabi Alonso intends to retire from football this summer.  If so, 35-year-old Alonso will bring an end to a glittering career when he plays his last game for current club Bayern Munich, likely to be in May, when the Bundesliga season ends.  A fantastic career, with trophies galore  Having started his career with Real Sociedad in his native Spain, the midfielder's impressive performances earned him a move to Liverpool, where he became a fan favourite with his cultured yet combative performances in central midfield.  Enjoying impressive midfield partnerships with the likes of Steven Gerrard and Javier Mascherano during his time on L4, Alonso was always one of the first names on the team sheet, winning honours such as the UEFA Champions League and his FA Cup - scoring the equalising goal against AC Milan in the famous Istanbul comeback.  With Liverpool struggling financially and manager Rafa Benitez frustrating Alonso by pursuing other options in midfield, the midfielder returned to Spain in 2009 as Real Madrid paid £30million for his services.  In five years at the Bernabeu, Alonso won both a league title and the Champions League, becoming part of a list of few players to have won the European Cup with two different clubs.  His next, and final, move of his career came in 2014 as German giants Bayern Munich snapped him up, Alonso adding another huge club to his playing portfolio.  During his time with the Bavarians Alonso has failed to land his third Champions League title, but has won consecutive league titles, and has another opportunity this season as Bayern fight it out with RB Leipzig at the top of the table.  His career hasn't only been impressive domestically, with Alonso having played a key role in the Spain side which won Euro 2008, World Cup 2010 and Euro 2012, cementing their place in footballing history. He made 114 appearances for his country before bowing out of the international game in 2014.  A popular figure within the game who has an excellent footballing brain, Alonso will no doubt be short of suitors should he decide to go into coaching after hanging up his boots - whether he does so this summer or at a later date.<|im_end|>

@vidana88 via Twenty20  A key to a happy, successful life is making a conscious choice to live in the “the now.” The only time that matters is the present moment. It is the only place where you can live and learn. The present is where you can make a difference. It is where you can truly express yourself and experience boundless opportunity.  The fortunate among us know this in a profound way. And they live their lives accordingly. They participate knowing there’s a chance they can fall and lose it all. They’re willing to play the “game of life,” aware that defeat is a possibility, but they choose to focus on a victorious outcome. They’re anxious to attend the “school of life,” knowing that they will be subjected to difficulties, challenges, loss and tragedy, but as long as they learn the lessons, they will prevail and opportunity will flourish. In short, they know that there are no guarantees… only choices. The right to choose one’s own way. And that choice happens every second of every day.  I know I’ll never know what favor or misfortune life has in store for me and I’m not supposed to know. But I will never know what I’m made of if I don’t participate in every moment with courage, patience, positive thinking and an optimistic attitude. All of these pave the way for opportunity.  I believe opportunities come as seed possibilities that in time will gradually grow into the desire you want to manifest. The seed, however, will not grow without the proper care and nourishment it needs in order for it to take root and blossom into its full potential. That’s your job and responsibility.  If you are creating a business plan, or writing out your goals, or really anything at all that needs to be accomplished during the day, it is up to you to first cultivate your state of consciousness, which is your “garden,” with positive thoughts, words and the right attitude so the seed possibility for opportunity can take root.  Then once the seed is planted, it is essential to continue to nourish the seed possibility with a steady flow of nutrients from the streams of faith, the right attitude and a continuous constructive way of thinking.  It’s important to remember that seed possibilities for opportunity can come in many guises. They can come in the form of a book, an inspiring movie, lyrics to a song, an advertisement, a dream, an idea that hits you as you’re exercising, walking your dog, driving your car, having a conversation with a total stranger, shopping or taking a shower—anything that will inspire you to take action. You have to be open to it in any moment, not just when you’ve decided it’s appropriate.  People often wonder why opportunity doesn’t come their way. I believe opportunity comes into our lives more often than we think, but it’s our own negative inertia that keeps us from acknowledging it.  Acknowledging every moment as an opportunity to transmit and receive is your choice and your responsibility. I mean, sometimes opportunity is right in front of you screaming, “Hey pal, I’m right here in front of you! Take advantage of me! This is what you asked for. Come on, wake up and acknowledge me! I’m not going to be here all day!’”  Understand this: It’s impossible for anyone to acknowledge opportunity if they can’t see it. And the reason they can’t see it is because of their attitude. They lack faith. They’re on a rampage of negative thinking. They’re consumed with anger, fear, jealousy, guilt or a combination of other negative emotions. All negative emotions, are destroyers of the spirit. They keep the light from a truer, higher part of yourself from shining.  In other words, if you’re not in the right state of consciousness, opportunity lays dormant in the darkness, and in a short period of time, it will simply fade away. Its purpose is lost.  It’s crucial that we come to the understanding that we are the creators of our lives. We are in more control of our destiny than we think.  We must remember that every moment is an opportunity to invoke the Universal Law. Simply stated, you attract to your life anything you give your thoughts, energy, focus and attention to—whether you want it in your life or don’t want it in your life. What you think about and say out loud is what you create.  As long as you keep thinking in limiting ways that define and reinforce the “impossible you,” you will never be able to experience the opportunities that are in store for you.  Your responsibility to yourself, as well as to the Universal Law, is to make sure you are inwardly poised and to keep your thoughts positive and loving, in spite of the injustice or chaos around you. That’s what faith is all about.<|im_end|>

# NYPD tows 30 cars after posting 'no parking' during flag football game

NYPD tows THIRTY cars after posting 'no parking' signs to reserve space for officers' vehicles during the department's flag football game The New York Police Department posted restricted parking signs for Sunday in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan A total of 30 vehicles were towed but people were not charged fines, NYPD said The 'no parking' order was put in place to save space for a flag football game Residents called the commandeering of the street parking placard abuse NYPD Commissioner said it was not abuse and in line with special event protocol A Columbia University representative said that 'no parking' signs are never put up in the area when thousands come to attend its football games each fall Two trucks and 'no parking' signs hung by the New York Police Department in one Manhattan neighborhood have residents upset. The signs were placed so that officers would have space to park for a department flag football game being held in Inwood, which garnered criticism as Mayor Bill de Blasio has made it a point to crack down on placard abuse. Resident Tasha Darbes told New York 1 she had to pay $34 to park in the local garage on Sunday during the department's game due to adhering the restricted parking signs on 218th Street. 'I was just flabbergasted,' Darbes said. 'A real abuse of power.' A total of 30 vehicles belonging to people who chose to park on the street despite the signs were relocated 'within the vicinity' and those owners will not be charged a fine, Detective Sophia Mason said in a statement to HuffPost on Monday. NYPD posted 'no parking' signs (pictured) in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan so that officers would have space to park for a department flag football game being held on Sunday New York 1 reporter Michael Scotto tweeted on Monday night: 'These "no parking" signs were posted all along 218th Street in Inwood this weekend, forcing residents to move their cars. Why? So police officers could park their own cars on the street for a flag football game. @placardabuse @NY1' Darbes said of how she felt compelled to park in the pricey garage: 'I assumed it was for construction, and there was no time. So, I didn't know what time I would need to move my car by, so I went and parked in the local garage.' Mason said the reason for the restricted parking was due to 'concerns of traffic congestion, pedestrian management and access for disabled persons,' as the event was open to the public. A total of 30 cars were towed, but those owners will not be charged with fines, an NYPD spokesperson said. A file photo of a police tow truck relocating a vehicle is shown The signs were posted five days in advance, Mason noted. Still, New Yorkers were outraged at the commandeering of precious parking spots by the NYPD. One person tweeted: '.@BilldeBlasio .@NYCSpeakerCoJo doesn’t this count as @placardabuse and how are you planning to handle it?' Another user, listed as Chesney Parks, tweeted, 'How unconcerned do you have to be about your own public image that you behave like this at a time when you know that @placardabuse is in the media spotlight?' One person tweeted: '.@BilldeBlasio .@NYCSpeakerCoJo doesn’t this count as @placardabuse and how are you planning to handle it?' Another user, listed as Chesney Parks, tweeted, 'How unconcerned do you have to be about your own public image that you behave like this at a time when you know that @placardabuse is in the media spotlight?' Placard abuse is the practice of city officials abusing parking privileges by parking in what would otherwise be illegal spaces, sometimes with no more than a handwritten note on the dash to identify their vehicles as exempt from the usual rules. There's an entire Twitter account devoted to the issue, under the username @placardabuse with 5,000 followers, which NY1's Scotto tagged in his tweet. The posting of the 'no parking' signs was defended by NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill in a press conference on Tuesday. Residents called the commandeering of the street parking on 218th Street placard abuse NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said it was not abuse and in line with special event protocol Executive producer of digital at New York 1 Lindsey Christ tweeted on Tuesday: 'Hmmm... this wasn't official business or an event for the wider public. It was a fun indoor activity for co-workers, and they wanted to be able to park right in front of it. Doesn't seem like the type of thing the police usually block off parking for...' 'This was the flag football championship,' O'Neill said. 'Special events go on throughout this city. So this is something that the commissioner’s football league has every year. There were signs put out five days in advance.' O'Niell pointedly said the restricted parking did not rise to the level of placard abuse, even though some cars parked on the street had nothing more than a handwritten note that read, 'On Police Commissioner’s Flag football team,' according to NY1. O'Neill said: 'It was clearly marked "no parking" on Sunday. It’s a special event.' Executive producer of digital at New York 1 Lindsey Christ tweeted on Tuesday: 'Hmmm... this wasn't official business or an event for the wider public. It was a fun indoor activity for co-workers, and they wanted to be able to park right in front of it. Doesn't seem like the type of thing the police usually block off parking for...' A Columbia University representative said that 'no parking' signs are never put up in the area when thousands come from near and far to attend its football games each fall.

# DIY elderberry syrup may be what you need to beat the flu

SAN ANTONIO — Elderberry syrup—the remedy some people are saying is more effective at getting rid of flu symptoms than the flu shot itself. People have been raving online about the all-natural blend, saying that it can break flu symptoms in less than 48 hours. Lauren Overton, the San Antonian who founded Lauren Nicole’s Elderberry Syrup booth at Cibolo Granges Farmer’s & Artisan Market, stopped by KENS 5 studio to share the recipe she said is responsible for her family’s consistent health for nearly a year.  “I’ve been making this and taking it with my family just as an immune booster, and none of us have been sick since we started taking it,” Overton said. She added that many people she knows believe that a simple elderberry blend can be more effective in fighting the flu than a flu shot. “I agree (that it’s more effective than a flu shot) because it kills more than one strand of the flu and adds several other health benefits,” Overton said. She had three ingredients of choice: Dried elderberry seeds, a mixture of spices including ginger, cinnamon and clove, and local raw honey, which she added after allowing the mixture to boil for 45 minutes to an hour. “You always want to start off with dried elderberry,” she said. “Everyone's always worried about if elderberry is poisonous, and it is if you grab it from the bush and try to eat it. So you don't want to do that.” According to Overton, dried elderberries may be difficult to come by in southern states, but she special-orders them and makes them available at the Cibolo Granges Farmer’s Market every Thursday from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. For more information about Overton’s recipes, click here. Doctors agree that elderberries have nutrients and vitamins that can help you stay healthy, but warn elderberry products are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Please consult with your physician before trying elderberry products.<|im_end|>

# This cool video reimagines Game of Thrones’ title sequence in the style of Westworld

HBO’s final season of Game of Thrones is in the midst of its run, and a Belgian designer took the opportunity to reimagine the show’s title sequence in the style of another of the network’s big shows, Westworld  “Westerosworld” does two cool things: it takes the look and stylings of Westworld’s opening credits — minimalist white designs and figures being constructed with advanced 3D printers — and changes that over to things like dragons, the house flags, the Night King, and the Iron Throne, with a hint of color accenting them. The video also takes Game of Thrones’ iconic theme song, and reimagines it in the same style, thanks to composer Brandon Chapman, who posted the track a year ago on Soundcloud, and which seems to have inspired the video project.  The description of the video notes that it took Belgian designer Gilles Augustijnen about eight months of on-and-off work, using After Effects, C4D, Photoshop, Illustrator, Substance Painter, ZBrush, Fusion360, and DAZ3D to bring the sequence to life, aided by Pieterjan Djufri Futra and Loris Ayné (who provided feedback, support, and help with hard surface modeling.)  The result is a sublime mashup of the two worlds — it’s a slick video, and who knows? Maybe we’ll find at the end that Westros was a deeply immersive world put on for the excitement of rich tourists.<|im_end|>

# IMF: Mideast economies face volatile politics, oil prices

IMF: Mideast economies face volatile politics, oil prices  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Political uncertainty and volatile oil prices are weighing heavily on economic growth in the Middle East this year, according to a new report released Monday by the International Monetary Fund.  The report, which looks at the economies of 23 countries spanning North Africa, the Levant, the Persian Gulf, but also Djibouti, Somalia, Afghanistan and Pakistan, predicts that overall growth across these nations is expected to slowdown from close to 2% last year to about 1.5% in 2019.  Inflation is expected to remain unchanged at close to 10%.  A closer look, however, shows sharp variations from country to country.  Iran, for example, is expected to be among the hardest hit this year. The IMF expects a 6% retraction in economic growth in 2019 — and that does not factor in the recent announcement by the U.S. that waivers on Iranian oil exports will expire next week, further deepening Iran's economic recession. Last year, Iran's economy retracted by nearly 4% and inflation remains high.  "The removal of waiver will affect more the recession," said Jihad Azour, the IMF's Mideast and Central Asia department director. "A negative growth of 6% has an impact on poverty, social protection and also on jobs."  Azour said one of the most pressing issues facing Iran with the impact of U.S. sanctions is the need to align the official currency exchange rates for the Iranian rial with black market rates.  Wealthy Gulf Arab oil exporters face their own sets of challenges, namely diversifying their economies away from reliance on oil exports for revenue in the face of sharp ebbs and flows in prices over the past six months.  The international lender said the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar will also need to create 1 million new jobs annually for at least the next five years just to keep unemployment rates from climbing.  For these countries, overall economic growth is expected to remain basically unchanged at around 2% in 2019. Specifically, non-oil growth is projected to pick up slightly from last year at closer to 3% in 2019, although fiscal deficits will also expand somewhat from last year.  More specifically, Saudi Arabia's economic growth is expected to slow down from 2.2% in 2018 to 1.8% this year.  For oil importing countries like Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and others in the region, inflation overall is expected to remain mostly unchanged at around 10% and growth is expected to slow from just over 4% last year to 3.6% in 2019. That average is mainly driven by Pakistan, where economic growth is expected to slow from about 5% last year to close to 3% this year.  Meanwhile, protests in Algeria and Sudan, conflicts in Libya, Syria and Yemen, tensions between India and Pakistan and shaky peace talks in Afghanistan "may increase investors' perception of risk for the whole region, leading to capital outflows and exchange rate pressure," the IMF noted.  "This may feed back into further oil price volatility and regional uncertainty," the report said.  Oil prices climbed above $80 a barrel in October, then fell below $50 a barrel in January. The IMF is factoring an average of around $65 a barrel in the medium term. The organization says swings in oil prices are being impacted by global trade tensions, U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports and oil production cuts by OPEC and other oil producing nations.  The unrest in countries like Algeria and Sudan is heavily rooted in economic discontent over unemployment, corruption and poor public services.  For oil importing countries, unemployment remains stubbornly high at close to 25% among young people, the IMF said.<|im_end|>

# Starks residents to discuss possible solar power at Town Meeting on Saturday

Residents at the Starks annual Town Meeting on Saturday will be asked to discuss the possibility of using town land for the installation of solar panels for the generation of electrical power.  Townwide elections are set for noon until 8 p.m. Friday at the Starks Community Center on Anson Road. The annual business meeting and voting on the 55-article town warrant is scheduled for 9 a.m. Saturday, also at the Community Center.  Paul Frederick, chairman of the Starks Board of Selectmen, is up for re-election, unopposed on the ballot for a three-year term. He said he is seeking his 14th year on the board, with the past 10 years being consecutive. He said he previously served on the Board of Selectmen in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Maryann Gawlinski is unopposed on the election ballot for a seat on the Board of Assessors. Gwen Hilton, the incumbent, is not seeking re-election, Frederick said. The Starks seat on the local school board is not up for election this year.  Frederick said if all spending articles are passed as written Saturday, the annual budget will be $564,272, or up just over 1 percent from last year’s figure of $555,267. The town tax rate is $17.60 for every $1,000 in property valuation. There is a proposal in Article 48 to take $28,040 from undesignated funds, or surplus, to lower the tax commitment.  Frederick said the board wants authorization to investigate the use of various town properties as possible sites for photovoltaic or solar-collecting equipment. Frederick said a gravel pit on Sawyers Mills Road is a possible site.  He said there is no money involved with the idea at this point. The idea is to conduct a study about the possibility of erecting solar panels on the property that served as the town gravel pit for some 60 years. It’s about a 25-acre piece of property, he said.  “It’s just sitting there. It’s a worked-over gravel pit,” he said. “I don’t know if this is a practical concept or not, but we’ve discussed it some, and we’d like to pursue more information, investigate.”  Frederick said the second item of possible interest Saturday involves the town fire station.  “We raised some money last year to do some work there, but we did not do the work,” he said. “That’s a $35,000 item, and we just did not find a contractor to do what we wanted done in a timely fashion. We’ve delayed that until this year.”  Also on the town warrant is a proposal to raise $5,000 and to appropriate another $4,157 from the 2018 Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursement to purchase a commercial generator for use at the town garage and the fire station. He said, when there are power outages in Starks, town officials will be able to electrically lift and lower the heavy rolled doors at the fire station and the garage.  “We’ll be able to get our equipment out during power outages without having to fight with those heavy doors and lift them up manually,” Frederick said.  Voting on Saturday also will include requests for funding general administration in the amount of $98,166. That account includes computer upgrades, payroll taxes, insurance and legal expenses. Voters also will be asked to raise a total of $65,650 for town salaries, $3,500 for operating expenses at the former Starks Town Hall on Locke Hill Road and $12,160 for the town’s contribution to the Anson Madison Starks Ambulance Service.  Funding requests Saturday also are to include $43,300 for the Fire Department, $18,000 for the Community Center and $46,000 for equipment maintenance for the coming year. For the road accounts, funding requests include $72,500 for summer roads, $62,000 for winter roads and $9,787 for the debt service on salt shed bond.  In Article 43, Starks residents will be asked to take $135,000 from the state Local Roads Assistance Program to pave the upper section of Chicken Street.<|im_end|>

# IAG boss says new Norwegian bid unlikely, but 'never say never'

IAG boss says new Norwegian bid unlikely, but 'never say never'  BRUSSELS, March 6 (Reuters) - British Airways owner IAG is unlikely to renew its interest in Norwegian Air after ruling out a new bid for the Scandinavian carrier earlier in the year, but "never say never", IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh said on Wednesday.  "I'd never say never, but I think it's unlikely," Walsh told reporters on the sidelines of the Airlines for Europe summit in Brussels.  IAG sold its stake in Norwegian when it ended its interest in the airline, which competes with IAG's low-cost long-haul Level brand, earlier this year.  "If there was a case that we might have done that (renewed our interest), we probably would have retained the shares in Norwegian," he added.  Asked if Level could expand into Scandinavia, Walsh said: "It could, ultimately."  "There are several significant markets that are underserved from a long-haul point of view and can be best served by a low-cost model," he said.  He also said that, although he was still not interested in buying A380s, those who wanted to approach him with offers after Airbus said it was scrapping production of the superjumbo should do so.  "I'm not looking to buy A380s. If there are people looking to sell them, they should probably approach us, because we would be one of the few people who might be interested. But I'm not looking to buy," he said. "Let's see what happens."

# This Week: Apple results, Fed meeting, nonfarm payrolls

By The Associated Press  A look at some of the key business events and economic indicators upcoming this week:  SOUR APPLE?  Wall Street expects that Apple’s latest quarterly snapshot will show a discouraging start to 2019.  Financial analysts predict the consumer electronics giant will report Tuesday that its earnings and revenue declined in the January-March quarter versus a year earlier. Apple acknowledged earlier this year that demand for iPhones is waning.  THE FED SPEAKS  Federal Reserve policymakers wrap up a two-day meeting Wednesday.  Investors will be listening for an update on the central bank’s interest rate policy. At the Fed’s last meeting in March, officials left the Fed’s key interest rate unchanged and trimmed their outlook for rate hikes this year from two to none.  EYE ON HIRING Many businesses are still in a hiring mood, despite some signs that the pace of economic growth is slowing.  Hiring rebounded in March as U.S. employers added a solid 196,000 jobs, up sharply from a scant gain in February. And the nation’s unemployment rate remained at 3.8%, near the lowest level in almost 50 years. Economists expect the Labor Department will report Friday that nonfarm employers added 177,500 jobs in April.  Nonfarm payrolls, monthly change, seasonally adjusted:  Nov. 196,000  Dec. 227,000  Jan. 312,000  Feb. 33,000  March 196,000  April (est.) 177,500  Source: FactSet<|im_end|>

# Gmail password: How to change your password on Gmail? Is Gmail safe to use?

One billion people around the world use Google Gmail for both work and leisure. Security and privacy are today at a premium, which means protecting your password has never been more important. Email experts stress we should all periodically change our passwords – so Express.co.uk explains how to do this on Google Gmail. How to change your Google Gmail password: Begin by heading to the Google Account page and tap the blue Sign-In button. You will next be asked two enter your login details and if needed, verify your identity via two-factor authentication. Then tap the Security tab to be presented with a number of options. Scroll through these options until you find the Signing In To Google section. The section titled Password informs you when you last changed it and whether you have activated two-step verification. READ MORE: How to create a Hotmail email? Click the Password button and enter your password again to confirm your identity. You will then need to enter a new password. It is important to make your password impossible to guess by including a variety of numbers, lower and upper case letters and special characters. It is recommended you use a password manager, if you have concerns about forgetting your new one. Once the new Gmail password has been verified, it is now ready and your account is secure. It is important to note this method for changing your password is a little different, but no more complicated on Android devices. Is Google Gmail safe to use? In short, Gmail is one of the safest free email options available, but care should still be taken. Cryptography can be incredibly confusing but put simply, Google transmits Gmail information in a coded format that only the user can decode. So, for users using strong passwords and two-step authentication, then Gmail is perfectly safe to use. However, Google is known for generating revenue by performing automated scans of the contents of its users Gmail accounts and messages. It is therefore technically possible for hackers to learn a lot about a target simply by observing the target’s behaviour-based web adverts or personalised search result rankings. While it is mainly unknown whether such attacks taken place, they are certainly possible. It is also technically possible to intercept Gmail data in transit via infected machines and spoofed digital certificates. And there is the added factor of Google complying with information requests from governments. It is therefore down to the user to assess the kinds of communicating they make via Gmail email and decide for themselves if using it is appropriate. So users regularly dealing with incredibly sensitive or valuable information will probably going to want to avoid Gmail or other cloud-storage email systems. This is because valuable information is all sought after by hobbyist, criminal, and state-sponsored hackers.<|im_end|>

# Donald Trump Wants To Win Re-Election In 2020 So He Can Avoid Going To Prison, New Report Claims

A new report claims Donald Trump may have a bit of extra motivation to win re-election in 2020 — staying out of prison.  After his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, was indicted and ultimately sentenced to prison for a felony campaign finance violation that directly implicated Trump, the president is reportedly very worried that he could be next. Sources close to Trump told The New York Times that Trump is taking comfort in the Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted, but is concerned that he could face an indictment and potential prison sentence as soon as he leaves office.  The new report comes amid growing evidence that Trump was directly involved in the hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the campaign. The New York Times published copies of the checks that Trump allegedly wrote to Cohen to cover the payments, and Cohen already provided copies of those checks to Congress when he appeared last week.  During his appearance, Cohen also confirmed that the “Individual-1” mentioned in the indictment documents was indeed Trump. That would seem to put Trump on the hook for the same felony violations as Cohen, and former White House counsel Robert Bauer told The New York Times that the evidence “leaves little doubt that [Trump] faces criminal prosecution after he leaves office.”  There are others who share the sentiment. Former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi told Hill.TV’s Krystal Ball and Buck Sexton that if he were in charge of the Russia investigation, he would have already lodged an indictment against Donald Trump, but the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president prevented it.  “If the president of the United States weren’t the president, and he was just a 34-year-old, 35-year-old candidate, and his buddy [Michael] Cohen had pleaded guilty with all of the corroboration,” Rossi said.  Rossi noted that longtime Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg has also been granted immunity and is “probably singing like a bird” about potential crimes.  “I would have presented to the grand jury in August, an indictment against Donald Trump. The only reason he is not currently indicted is he’s the president,” he said.   #MichaelCohen testimony predictably results in #NY insurance probe. If there is evidence of a crime, no protection v indictment for a sitting #POTUS: "New York regulators subpoena Trump Organization's insurer as part of big probe of business" https://t.co/iM0FsYKRip  — Maya Wiley (@mayawiley) March 5, 2019 If The New York Times report is accurate, it would add even higher stakes to an already contentious 2020 presidential election. Donald Trump has been launching attacks on Twitter against prospective Democratic candidates, with special attention on Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Per The Inquisitr, Trump seems to be facing other electoral challenges, including polls that show support slipping among important voting blocs and in key battleground states.<|im_end|>

# World famous stats guru predicts Premier League finish - who wins?

Nate Silver's website has predicted who will win the Premier League title.  Silver is most well known for correctly predicting the outcomes of the 2008 and 2012 US Presidential elections, but his roots actually lie in sports data modelling.  His website, FiveThirtyEight , has now created a Premier League data model to predict who will win the title - and the probabilities of various outcomes.  Manchester City are set to finish top in the prediction with 93 points, pipping second-placed Liverpool to the title by two points.  Tottenham Hotspur finish third, two points ahead of fourth-placed Chelsea.  Maurizio Sarri's Blues beat Arsenal to fourth place by two points, with the fifth-placed Gunners finishing level on points with Manchester United but beating them to fifth thanks to a better goal difference.  Man City have a 65 per cent chance of winning the Premier League, with there currently being a 35 per cent chance of the title going to Anfield.  The probability of Chelsea qualifying for the Champions League is 51 per cent - much better than Arsenal's 38 per cent and Manchester United's 32 per cent.  At the other end, Cardiff City, Fulham and Huddersfield Town are all relegated.  How it works  According to Gazette Live , Silver’s sports modelling crunches a torrent of numbers to produce a unique ‘soccer performance index’ for each club.  That is derived from historical data on past performance, individual player match-by-match ratings based on Opta scores, attacking and defending weighting and a complex variety of other factors including the vogue measure of ‘expected goals.’  The model also takes account of types of goals scored and conceded and tries to quantify ‘luck’, the discrepancy between data showing the team is playing well but a result going against them. That SPI changes with every result and is used to model the projected outcomes of all the remaining fixtures for every team.<|im_end|>

# Anonymous Social Media Network Gabble Adds a New Twist to Social Discussions

HOUSTON, April 29, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- A twist on social media discussion boards has been launched with the Gabble website and smart phone app (https://gabbleapp.com/). Gabble allows users to connect and interact with their existing Facebook friends, but in anonymity. The concept evolved from the interest in friends and colleagues to be able to discuss sensitive topics without the fear of embarrassment or even potential backlash. Parent company 32nd Degree believes that people want to discuss important topics anonymously but more importantly in a way that they can get feedback from their peers and not just random people. Most people respect their friends and often those that they have accepted friend requests from on Facebook. Now users can discuss relationships, taxes, addictions, finances, religion, politics and more with their friends while maintaining their secrecy and avoiding any public shaming.  When a user starts a new Gabble discussion thread the app assigns them a random username to hide the identity of the user. Every new contributor to the thread is also assigned a random username for that thread. This allows for users to follow the conversation without having to reveal who is posting on the thread. Gabble users have the ability to block specific Facebook friends from viewing their posts which is great for parents, adult children, or even spouses to be able to discuss private matters without fear of family members recognizing them as the content creators. Users can create anonymous polls, as well, to garner votes from friends on sensitive topics. Users can choose to view "public" or "friends only" posts in case they want to discuss with a group wider than their friends circle. In order to protect new users from easily being identified by their friends when only a few friends are using the app, Gabble mixes these "public" threads into every new users' timeline to help maintain anonymity for their friends who have also created their first threads. As users gather more friends who also use the app fewer public posts are mixed into the timeline.  Gabble is available via the browser at https://gabbleapp.com/ or as an app in the iOS and Android app stores. This press release was issued through 24-7PressRelease.com. For further information, visit http://www.24-7pressrelease.com.  SOURCE 32nd Degree<|im_end|>

# Commentary: Face it. Low growth is the world’s ‘new mediocre’

NEW YORK: Financial markets tend to undergo manic-depressive cycles, and this has been especially true in recent years. During risk-ons, investors – driven by “animal spirits” – produce bull markets, frothiness, and sometimes outright bubbles; eventually, however, they overreact to some negative shock by becoming too pessimistic, shedding risk and forcing a correction or bear market. Whereas prices of US and global equities rose sharply throughout 2017, markets began to wobble in 2018, and became fully depressed in the last quarter of the year. This risk-off reflected concerns about a global recession, Sino-American trade tensions, and the Federal Reserve’s signals that it would continue to raise interest rates and pursue quantitative tightening. But since this past January, markets have rallied, so much so that some senior asset managers now foresee a market “melt-up” (the opposite of a meltdown), with equities continuing to rise sharply above their current elevated levels. GOOD GROWTH FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR? One could argue that this latest risk-on cycle will continue for the rest of the year. For starters, growth is stabilising in China, owing to another round of macroeconomic stimulus there, easing fears of a hard landing. And the US and China may soon reach a deal to prevent the ongoing trade war from escalating further. At the same time, US and global growth are expected to strengthen somewhat in the second half of the year, and the disruption of a “hard Brexit” has been averted, with the European Union extending the deadline for the United Kingdom’s departure to October 31, 2019. As for the eurozone’s prospects, much will depend on Germany, where growth could rebound as global headwinds fade. Moreover, central banks, particularly the Fed, have become super-dovish again, and this appears to have reversed the tightening of financial conditions that produced the risk-off in late 2018. And on the political front, the chances of impeachment proceedings in the US have fallen sharply with the release of the Mueller report, which clears US President Donald Trump of criminal conspiracy charges (though it is not dispositive on the question of obstruction of justice). Now that the Russia investigation is over, Trump may avoid issuing destabilising statements (or tweets) that could rattle the stock market, given that it is a key benchmark by which he judges his own success. Finally, in a positive feedback loop, stronger markets boost economic growth, which in turn can lead to even higher market values. BUT HUGE RISKS REMAIN These developments may or may not ensure clear sailing for the rest of the year. While markets have already priced in the aforementioned positive potentialities, other factors could trigger another risk-off episode. First, the price-to-earnings ratio is high in many markets, particularly for US equities, which means that even a modest negative shock could trigger a correction. In fact, US corporate profit margins are so high that there could be an “earnings recession” this year if growth remains around 2 per cent, while production costs may increase with a tight labour market. Second, there are heightened risks associated with the scale and composition of US corporate-sector debt, owing to the prevalence of leveraged loans, high-yield junk bonds, and “fallen-angel” firms whose bonds have been downgraded from investment-grade to near-junk status. Moreover, the commercial real-estate sector is burdened with overcapacity, as developers overbuilt and e-commerce sales have undercut demand for brick-and-mortar retail space. Against this backdrop, any sign of a growth slowdown could lead to a sudden increase in the cost of capital for highly leveraged firms, not just in the US, but also in emerging markets, where a significant share of debt is denominated in dollars. Third, assuming that US economic growth holds up, market expectations of more Fed dovishness will likely prove unfounded. Thus, a Fed decision not to cut rates could come as a surprise, triggering an equity correction. Fourth, hopes of a resolution to the Sino-American trade war may also be misplaced. Even with a deal, the conflict could escalate again if either side suspects the other of not holding up its end. And other simmering trade tensions could boil over, if, for example, the US Congress fails to ratify the Trump administration’s revised North American Free Trade Agreement, or if Trump follows through with import tariffs on cars from Europe.  Fifth, European growth is very fragile, and could be hindered by any of a number of developments, from a strong showing by populist parties in the upcoming European Parliament elections to a political or economic crisis in Italy. This would come at a time when monetary and fiscal stimulus in the eurozone is constrained and eurozone integration is stalled. Sixth, many emerging-market economies are also heavily exposed to political and policy risks. These include (from least to most fragile): Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Iran, and Venezuela. And China’s latest round of stimulus has saddled its already indebted corporate sector with even more financial risk – and may not even suffice in lifting its growth rate. Seventh, Trump may react to the Mueller report with bluster, not prudence. With an eye to the 2020 presidential election, he could double down on his fights with the Democrats, launch new salvos in the trade war, stack the Fed Board with unqualified cronies, bully the Fed to cut rates, or precipitate another government shutdown over the debt ceiling or immigration policy. At the same time, the Trump administration’s approach to Iran and Venezuela could put further upward pressure on oil prices – which have rallied since last fall – to the detriment of growth. LOW GROWTH THE NEW MEDIOCRE Finally, we are still in a world of low potential growth – a “New Mediocre” sustained by high private and public debt, rising inequality, and heightened geopolitical risk. The widespread populist backlash against globalisation, trade, migration, and technology will all but certainly have an eventual negative impact on growth and markets. So, while investors’ latest love affair with equity markets may continue this year, it will remain a fickle and volatile relationship. Any number of disappointments could trigger another risk-off and, possibly, a sharp market correction. The question is not whether it will happen, but when.

# Porto Beat Roma With Extra-Time VAR Penalty

Porto Beat Roma With Extra-Time VAR Penalty  Alex Telles scored an extra-time penalty following a VAR review to send Porto through to the Champions League quarter-finals at the expense of Roma. Alessandro Florenzi was penalised for dragging Fernando back when the ball was fizzed across the goal in the 116th minute and Telles emphatically converted from the spot. Porto's Moussa Marega took the game to extra-time when he got on the end of Jesus Corona's curling cross. Roma captain Daniele de Rossi had earlier cancelled out Francisco Soares' opener for Porto in the first half. It is the first time the Portuguese side have reached the quarter-finals since 2014-15. The draw for the quarter-finals takes place on Friday, 15 March.<|im_end|>

# CNN Stacks 'Democratic Voters' Panel With Political Activists, Candidate

CNN aired two panels this week, purporting to show the thoughts of “Democratic voters” throughout the country. However, a Breitbart News investigation indicates that three of the panel members also have a past of political activism far beyond your average voter.  In on air segments that made the rounds online this week, the panel, introduced alternatively as “Hillary Clinton voters” or as “Democratic voters,” expressed their opinions about the current state of the Democratic Party.  One moment that CNN highlighted was that the group flatly rejected Joe Biden as a 2020 candidate.   Alisyn Camerota asked a panel of six Democrats, "How many of you would like to see Joe Biden get in? Show of hands."  No one raised their hands.  — New Day (@NewDay) March 5, 2019 In another segment, the group heaped praise on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).  One panel member, Michael Milisits, said that it was time for Democrats to “think outside the box” and not nominate a centrist candidate.  Milisits also praised Ocasio-Cortez for making the Democratic Party “nervous” and said that she represents the “new guard.”  Unbeknownst to the viewers of this clip, Milisits is not just a “voter,” but is himself a politician. He ran for Congress in the Democratic primary in Ohio as a strong Bernie Sanders supporter.  Milisits was profiled in an article published by the Dayton Daily News in January 2018 titled, “Local Democratic candidate for Congress says Bernie Sanders inspired him.”   Self-identified as a progressive populist, Milisits says he’s firmly in the “Bernie camp,” a reference to U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who ran in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. He had reservations about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, but said he voted for her nonetheless. Two other panel members, Mary Reaman and Christian Tamte, are also political activists. Both worked as organizers for the 2017 Women’s March in Washington, D.C.  Reaman organized a busload of people to go to the 2017 Women’s March, according to the Dayton Daily News.   “Those of us who go have to come home and march. We have to come home and be activists,” said Rev. Mary H. Reaman, pastor of Tree of Life Community: A Unitarian Universalist Congregation in Dayton. “It can’t be a one-shot deal. We’re going to have to be organized.”  “My hope is that we are starting to generate a generation of women activists,” said Reaman, who organized a busload of mostly women to go to the march. She was also featured in a video at the time:  She also identified herself with the #Resistance movement.  Christian Tamte, who was also on the CNN panel, was another organizer for the Women’s March, directing buses of people to the Washington rally in 2017, and even starting a business meant to help activists travel to events.  In January 2017, Columbus Alive reported:   On Saturday, Jan. 21, one day after the presidential inauguration, approximately 200,000 people are expected to descend on the nation’s capital for the “Women’s March on Washington.” The grassroots effort, organized to defend women’s rights and stand in solidarity with other marginalized communities, has inspired women worldwide, including Columbus resident Christian Tamte. She will take over 100 people to the march via two buses.  “This isn’t just a bus ride,” Tamte said in a mid-January interview at a German Village coffee shop. “This is a mobile conference. This is a mobile think tank. This is something that is going to empower and educate and make [people] better advocates.”  …  “Rolling into Washington” is a launching pad for Tamte’s new company, RISE Travel, which she described as “advocacy and education in action.” Tamte’s goal is to offer transportation, lodging and workshops for people attending marches and rallies around the country. The company will also host local events; there are already plans in the works for an International Women’s Day celebration in March. This is not to allege bad faith on the part of the panel members. However, CNN airing this panel and labelling the participants, several of whom are political activists, “Democratic voters” as if they were representative of everyday voters is far from honest journalism.  Indeed, as Breitbart News’s John Nolte wrote Tuesday, the panel members’ opinions, specifically their thoughts on Joe Biden, are not at all representative of the thoughts of Democrat voters in general.   As of right now, former Vice President Joe Biden is not only leading the field for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination by ten points, he is earning an average of 29 percent support in a field of 12.  In other words, nearly one in three Democrat primary voters support Biden.  Nonetheless, despite Biden’s steady level of support, the far-left CNN put together a focus group where not one person in the group supported Biden.  This phony focus group consisted of exactly six people who were dragged out of bed to appear on CNN’s failing morning show — and I use the word “phony” with confidence because a focus group is supposed to represent a cross-section of people, and if CNN had been at all interested in presenting a cross-section using six measly people, at least two (according to the polls) would have expressed support for Biden. This isn’t the first time one of CNN’s panels has been criticized for not disclosing the ties of its participants.  Last year, the network aired a panel of Republican women defending Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual misconduct.  Many news outlets, including Breitbart News, wrote about it at the time, but it turns out that CNN was also dishonest about that panel.  As The Wrap reported at the time, CNN was criticized for its presentation of the panel, as multiple women on the panel were not everyday Republican voters, but had political ties to the Republican Party in Florida, with one of the women previously running for a Congressional seat in the GOP primary.   1. CNN's framing of this segment was really irresponsible. This purported to be a focus group that would show what "Republican women" think of Kavanagh now. So each woman is identified as a "Republican voter." https://t.co/sV5eFUWTRL  — James Surowiecki (@JamesSurowiecki) September 23, 2018  3. The woman in the white sweater, Lourdes Castillo de la Pena, has served on the Republican National Senatorial Committee, and hosted a $1000-a-plate fundraiser for Ted Cruz's presidential campaign at her home.  — James Surowiecki (@JamesSurowiecki) September 23, 2018  5. Angela Vazquez is a Community Council member in Kendall, in Dade County. In other words, these were not GOP voters plucked off the street. They were, in large part, members of the GOP establishment in Miami-Dade.  — James Surowiecki (@JamesSurowiecki) September 23, 2018 CNN was also accused of stacking a recent town hall event against 2020 candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT).  Several audience members who asked Sanders questions were introduced with descriptions that did not reflect their level of involvement either professionally or politically with institutions that may have a bias against Sanders. Two audience members worked for the Democratic Party in some capacity.  Paste Magazine reported:   — CNN called Tara Ebersole a “former biology professor” when her LinkedIn page lists her current job description as “Chair, Baltimore County Democratic Party” since 2016. Further, her husband was part of Hillary Clinton’s leadership council in Baltimore in 2016.  — Abena McAllister was labeled “an active Democrat,” which is far less descriptive than the Charles County Democratic Central Committee’s description of her as their Chair. Sanders, as an independent, has raised the ire of some Democratic Party establishment members, especially after running hard against Hillary Clinton in 2016.<|im_end|>

# Tyson Fury dubbed ‘KING of boxing’ for hilarious Barry Hearn rant – ‘Back in the cupboard'

The Gypsy King is preparing to face Tom Schwarz in June at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas. It is Fury’s first fight since a controversial draw against WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. The 30-year-old has continued his incredible comeback since beating Wladimir Klitschko in November 2015. He has maintained his unbeaten record, with 27 careers wins and one draw. The Mancunian is popular for his antics outside the ring too. Fury speaks very openly about his rivalries, especially with Eddie Hearn. This saw his father Barry promote fellow client Dillian Whyte’s fight against Oscar Rivas this July. Fury’s rant comes as:   The 70-year-old took the chance, though, to have a go at Fury for rejecting a rematch with Wilder. And footage has emerged of Fury’s reaction to the speech, aiming his anger at Eddie. Speaking on his Instagram channel, the Gypsy King said: “Eddie, please sort your dad out. “He’s ruining the job for you. “First of all, he’s talking about slaves and slave driving with Dillian Whyte. “Next, he’s saying to the public ‘if you don’t like it, don’t pay for it. Everything’s pay-per-view. I’m not bothered if you buy it or now’. “Then, he’s getting incorrect information with Tom Schwarz because we both know he’s ranked number two in WBO and top 10 in IBF.” The 30-year-old went on to make a brutal suggestion for Hearn Snr. Fury added: “Best thing to do, Eddie, is give him another can of beer and put him back in the cupboard, the old red-faced fool. “Give him a four pack of Stella and put him back where he belongs before he ruins your job for you. “Eddie, you trying to charm everybody with your big smile and your handsome rogue face but your dad’s coming out and mucking it all up, mush. “Get back in the cupboard with a four pack of Stella.” “Best thing to do, Eddie, is give him another can of beer and put him back in the cupboard, the old red-faced fool” Tyson Fury And fans of the Gypsy King love his rant. “Long live the King,” one said. Another commented: “What a man.” While a third simply made huge claim about the heavyweight. “Fury the king of boxing,” they said. This comes as the Gypsy King enjoyed a girls’ night out last weekend.<|im_end|>

# Ness Wadia Sentenced In Japan Over Drugs Possession

Ness Wadia, the son of one of India's wealthiest businessman, was reportedly sentenced for a two-year jail term in Japan for possession of drugs.  Ness, who is the co-owner of Kings XI Punjab team, is the eldest son of Nusli Wadia and heir to the 283 Wadia group.  According to a report by the Financial Times, Ness Wadia was arrested in early March at New Chitose Airport in the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.  According to a brief report carried by a local Hokkaido station of state broadcaster NHK, customs officials at New Chitose were alerted to Wadia by sniffer dogs and a search revealed that he had about 25g of what appeared to be cannabis resin in his trouser pocket.  The Wadia empire has many units, which include Bombay Dyeing, Bombay Burman Trading, biscuit giant Britannia Industries to budget airline GoAir and a share in IPL franchise Kings XI Punjab with the total market valuation of its listed entities standing at $13.1 billion.  A court official in Sapporo told the Financial Times that Wadia admitted to possession, arguing that the drug was for his personal use.  Japan's narcotics laws are strict and are currently being applied especially tightly.  Wadia spent a period in detention before his indictment on March 20 and an undisclosed period of detention before a court hearing.  (With inputs from agencies)<|im_end|>

# Distributed Control System Vendors to Gain Revenue Opportunities by Focusing on Open Architectures

Integrated cybersecurity and service-based business models help vendors expand customer base, finds Frost & Sullivan SANTA CLARA, California, April 30, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- As end-user industries embrace the concept of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) or Industry 4.0, there will be greater demand for IT-operational technology (OT) convergence. In this environment, distributed control system (DCS) vendors that are keen to prove their agility and adaptability will look to innovate in the software segment to create value for end users. The revenue opportunities in evolving into an open, secure, and interoperable DCS systemis expected to drive the $14.79 billion DCS market towards $17.14 billion by 2025. "Owing to the higher adoption of digitalization in end-user industries, DCS vendors are collaborating with IT providers to develop digital capabilities. Start-ups with niche capabilities will, therefore, play a crucial role in the future of industrial automation," said Rohit Karthikeyan, senior research analyst for Frost & Sullivan's Global Industrial team. "Meanwhile, as end users' projects increase in scale and complexity, their dependence on main automation contractor (MAC) will also rise. Consequently, DCS vendors will strive to develop MAC capabilities to execute end-user automation projects and gain a competitive advantage." Frost & Sullivan's recent analysis, Analysis of the Global Distributed Control System Market, Forecast to 2025, examines the impact of digitalization on the DCS market. It also examines the key market participants and offers an in-depth analysis of the market revenue by different regions and revenue segments.

For further information on this analysis, please visit: http://frost.ly/3er "Going forward, the growth in emerging Asian countries will expand APAC's share of the global DCS market revenues to 34.8 percent by 2025," noted Karthikeyan. "Investments in new pipeline projects from the Middle East to Central Europe and refinery projects in countries such as Germany, France, and Italy are expected to lead to new midstream and downstream project activities and ultimately, revenue opportunities in the next three to five years." DCS vendors will be able to generate further revenues by making the most of the growth opportunities in: Providing services, mainly in the areas of operations, maintenance, training, and support. Minimizing the investment risk quotient by adopting new business models such as Product-as-a-Service, pay-per-use, and licensing. Offering retrofit cybersecurity solutions to end users and integrating cybersecurity functionality into their legacy systems. Cybersecurity is expected to evolve from reactive to predictive based on built-in cognitive functionalities to address the threats that the next-generation of open DCS systems are expected to face.

# 5 Current worst finishers in WWE

5 Current worst finishers in WWE  Finishers are one of the biggest weapons in the arsenal of a wrestler. Throughout the history of WWE, we have seen a lot of different deadly finishers that have made the fans look at awe on what they just witnessed. Finishers like The ChokeSlam, Spear, Tombstone Piledriver are legit deadly finishers which if done wrong can lead to heavy injuries. Then there are finishers like RKO, which are fan-favourites. Randy Orton might have a boring match but just one beautiful RKO to end the match makes fans jump in joy and excitement. Even after the finishers being such an important part of a match, there are many wrestlers in WWE currently, whose finishers are pretty underwhelming. It's tough to believe looking at them that these can actually keep someone down for a 3-count, especially considering they have better moves than that already in their arsenal. In this article, let's take a look at 5 Worst finishers in WWE today and the wrestlers that use them. Feel free to share your thoughts, views, and opinions in the comments section. #5 Bayley to Belly - Bayley While we all know how much Bayley loves to hug people, but her finisher should not be a hug and a soft slam on the mat. Bayley, no doubt, is one of the top women's wrestlers on the main roster, but her finisher is not so impressive. Even though WWE has given it a cute little name "Bayley to Belly", it is still just a Belly to Belly suplex, a basic move taught to everyone in their wrestling schools. This move would have looked more devastating had some huge monstrous superstar performed it, but with Bayley, you just look at it and say "aww", something which should not be taken as a compliment for a finisher. #4 Khallas - Jinder Mahal To be honest, the only time this move looked deadly was when Jinder once botched it on one of the Singh Brothers. For the rest of times, it's just a basic back bump.  Khallas is the closest to the Cobra clutch slam in pro wrestling books. But the way the move is executed, makes it look weird. Jinder wraps the opponent's hands around their arms but releases them before hitting it. It's like a bootleg Rock Bottom, but Rock Bottom was successful because The Rock made it famous by his charisma. Jinder seriously needs to change his finishers and a lot of other things if he wants fans to take him seriously.<|im_end|>

The megahit movie Avengers: Endgame destroyed box-office records in its opening weekend, but in Texas, the epic battles weren't confined to the screen.  A Domino's employee in Friendswood, about 20 miles southeast of Houston, was cited for misdemeanor assault after allegedly punching a co-worker for spoiling the Marvel superhero movie, police said. NBC News reported that Justin Gregory Surface, 33, hit a 24-year-old man in the chest for revealing a crucial ending spoiler.  According to Vox, the final episode of Marvel's so-called Infinity Saga grossed a record-setting $1.3 billion worldwide in its opening weekend, including $350 million in the U.S.<|im_end|>

# Lor Choc Is Telling Her Own Story — and Making Room for Queer Women in Hip Hop

At just 20 years old, Baltimore singer Lor Choc already possesses a voice — vulnerable and swaggering, childlike and melodic — that other artists work years to develop. It’s a voice that carries remarkable elasticity, one that allows for maximum emotional impact. “Sometimes I could use a hand/This wasn’t part of my plan/I don’t understand,” she sings on the heartbroken “Speechless (Hurts So Bad),” her lightly auto-tuned cry crackling nearly into tears. Choc, real name Delvrona Conley, broke out in 2017 with her song “Fast Life,” an optimistic ode to hustling that first displayed her talent for crafting impossibly catchy trap-pop hooks. Love is Love, her second proper project (after 2016’s Worth the Wait) dropped on Valentine’s Day this year, and swapped the exuberance of “Fast Life” for more pointed and melodic reflections on romantic love. Choc identifies as lesbian, and the songs on Love is Love wear their queerness on their sleeves. The infectious “Love Me,” which features maybe the best chorus on the album (“I gotta girl that really love me/But I’m too caught up in this money”), elaborates on a personal dilemma over trap-heavy piano frills, while on the atmospheric “Get Away,” she fantasizes about leaving town with a lover, with hazy, futuristic synths facilitating dreams of escape. The first time I listened to Love is Love, I was instantly hooked by Choc’s earworms and emotionally rich storytelling. But after digging into her story and speaking with her on the phone, I was blown away by the pride she takes in her queerness and the role it plays in her music, particularly considering that hip-hop has been traditionally defined by heterosexuality and masculinity since its inception. A homegrown, upstart singer on the precipice of making it big, Choc has gotten to where she is now by staying true to who she is. And as she tells it, that’s not changing anytime soon. Today, we’re premiering the video for the Love is Love highlight “Vibe,” a bashful and buoyant song that anyone who has fallen head over heels can relate to. Choc spoke with them. about Love is Love, lessons she learned growing up in a house full of women, coming out, and being queer while working in hip-hop. Love is Love is an album about relationships and what we experience in them, from devotion, jealousy, and trust to longing, sex and miscommunication. How did it come about? Love is Love is basically based off my whole relationship with my girlfriend now. We go through ups and downs and everything, but we don’t let that come through the bond that we have. The music I make is based off how I’m feeling, and I mainly write when I can pinpoint one exact emotion…. I feel like I make the most music, and can create the most songs — or better songs — when I can actually pinpoint one emotion at a specific time. That’s how the whole project came about. You’ve talked and rapped a lot about being proud of growing up in Baltimore. But the city doesn’t really have any history of a hip-hop artist or sound breaking out on a national scale. Do you feel like you have to put on for the whole city? Like you said, nobody’s really broken on a national scale, like with a Billboard hit… we ain’t got none of that right now. As far as me and my career, I gotta put on for the city, for my neighborhood, for the LGBTQ community, because a lot of people like to count us out as weirdos. I’m just here to tell people that it’s okay to be yourself. It’s okay to be from the hood and still be yourself. Just because you’re from the hood doesn’t mean you got to be hood. You ain’t gotta be a product of your environment. That’s my message to the world: if I can do it, you can do it. Coming up in Baltimore is hard, but that’s not an excuse. I just gotta open up a door that’s not already open for myself and for other rappers in the city. Rappers are making noise in the city, but they’re only making noise in the city!<|im_end|>

# Second again - Ohio finishes behind Texas in annual economic development report

Ohio has come in second again in a closely watched economic-development report. The state finished far behind Texas in the annual Site Selection magazine Governor's Cup results released Monday. It is the seventh straight year Ohio has come in No. 2. Ohio had 454 projects in 2018, below the 608 projects that Texas had. On a per-capita basis, Ohio came in third in terms of projects last year behind first-place Nebraska and second-place Kentucky. It is the third straight year those states finished 1-2-3. Site Selection defines a project as one that involves an investment of at least $1 million, creates at least 20 new jobs or adds at least 20,000 square feet of new floor area. It does not count retail projects, schools, hospitals or government projects. "Businesses are consistently choosing Ohio communities of all sizes as a destination for growth and investment," Dana Saucier, vice president and head of economic development at JobsOhio, the state's privatized economic-development operation, said in a statement. "Through close collaboration with state, regional and local economic development partners, Ohio offers companies across sector lines the solutions needed to thrive and succeed here." Ohio's cities also did well in the report. Cincinnati finished in fifth place among metro areas with a population of at least 1 million, while Columbus came in seventh. Toledo finished third among metro areas with a population of 200,000 to 1 million, and 17 Ohio cities with a population of 10,000 to 50,000 were among the top 100. Findlay grabbed the top spot for the fifth straight year, with Wooster, Ashland, Defiance and Tiffin placing in the top 10. Other Ohio cities on the list, in order of rank, were Wapakoneta, Fremont, Sidney, Ashtabula, Bellefontaine, Bucyrus, Celina, Zanesville, New Philadelphia-Dover, Norwalk, Salem and Wilmington. Site Selection has awarded the Governor's Cup every year since 1988 to the state with the greatest number of new and expanded corporate facilities tracked by Conway Data Inc.'s new plant database. mawilliams@dispatch.com @BizMarkWilliams<|im_end|>

# Man in custody after standoff in Valley Village

VALLEY VILLAGE — A suspect who barricaded himself in a home in Valley Village on Wednesday afternoon after police responded to the location to investigate a shots-fired call was taken into custody after a more than four-hour standoff.  The standoff began about 5:30 p.m. in the 12300 block of Burbank Boulevard, between Whitsett Avenue and Laurel Canyon Boulevard, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.  A SWAT team was called in to try to bring the matter to a peaceful conclusion, police said.  The man was taken into custody about 9:45 p.m., NBC4 reported.  The suspect was believed to be intoxicated and officers waited for him to sober up before taking him into custody, NBC4 said.  “This is the way we want all of these (standoffs) to end, no loss of life, no injuries,” LAPD Capt. Don Graham told NBC4. “While the community is impacted, the reverence for life overcomes all of that, which is why we come out with the resources that we do.”  Several nearby apartments were evacuated during the standoff. Those residents were allowed to return home Wednesday night.<|im_end|>

# Tyson Fury reveals exactly how much he'll earn from ESPN and Top Rank deal

Tyson Fury raised plenty of eyebrows when he penned a shock co-promotional deal with Top Rank and ESPN last month.  The ground-breaking link-up with legendary American promoter Bob Arum and Fury's UK promoter Frank Warren has already had a major impact for the Gypsy King.  His rematch with Deontay Wilder has fallen through and he is now set for a huge all-British showdown with Dillian Whyte, who is on the verge of following his lead by signing with Top Rank and ESPN.  But Fury is still furious that his clash with Wilder has collapsed - and he let slip exactly how much he is making from his big-money deal in his latest shot at the American heavyweight.  His five-fight deal with the broadcasting giants led to plenty of rumours regarding how much the deal was worth, with a £80m figure widely reported.  The Gypsy King has now confirmed those estimates to be on the ball - referring to his $100m (£76m) deal, which equates to $20m per fight.  In the same tweet, he branded Wilder a "big dosser" and slammed the American as being nothing without him.  Wilder is set to take on Dominic Breazeale in his next fight after being ordered to defend his title against his American rival by the WBC.  Fury, meanwhile, could face the first fight of his massive deal against Whyte with his deal set to be announced in the coming days.  When Fury's ESPN move was announced, promoter Frank Warren said: "This ESPN situation for him is probably one of the biggest things to happen to a British sportsman. It's something special."  Meanwhile, Fury took to Twitter to send his well-wishes to former heavyweight champion Frank Bruno in a video message.  Bruno has been treated in hospital after contracting pneumonia and is set for a "few weeks rest" as he recovers from the illness.<|im_end|>

# Ottawa County man rescued from burning home

OTTAWA COUNTY, Mich. — An Ottawa County couple lost their entire home in a fire that started late Wednesday night. One of the homeowners went back into his Tallmadge Township home to rescue his dogs just as deputies with the Ottawa County Sheriff arrived on scene. A deputy ran into the burning home pulling the 63-year-old man safely out of the basement. Both the man and woman who lived in the house, located off Winans Street between Linden Drive and 26th Avenue, made it out safely. It is not yet known if the dogs survived.  Two people were taken to Spectrum Health Hospital in downtown Grand Rapids to be treated for smoke inhalation. The deputy was also treated for smoke inhalation at the scene. The home, located near Grand Valley University's Allendale campus, was a total loss, and it's not yet clear what started the fire. ►Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this.

# The 2019 Independence Day Celebration: The Economic Successes And Failures

The 2019 Independence Day Celebration: The Economic Successes And Failures  Ghana was the first country in Sub-Saharan Africa to gain political independence from European colonial powers in 1957. Independence Day is a time to reaffirm national unity as well as national sovereignty. This year’s celebration will not be held in Accra’s Black Star Square but at Aliu Mahama sports stadium in the Northern regional capital –Tamale. The move is aimed at solidifying the peace and unity achieved in Dagbon. The theme for this 62nd Independence Celebration is “Celebrating Peace and Unity”. The Economic literature posits that in 1957, Ghana was the world’s leading producer and exporter of cocoa and exported 10% of the world’s gold, and had foreign reserves of £200 million. Ghana’s per capita income put it at par with South Korea. Modest industrialization based on import substitution was the core of the Convention Peoples' Party’s economic strategy. Nkrumah executed a number of development projects with the setting up of numerous schools and rapid improvement of transport infrastructure and the establishment of the port city of Tema. Nkrumah tried to free Ghana from dependency by building the Akosombo Hydroelectric Dam on the Volta River. By the middle of the 1960s, Ghana’s foreign reserves had dried up and the nation was in serious debt. The National Liberation Council (NLC) government, which ousted the Nkrumah administration in 1966 was more favourable to foreign interests. The NLC Government agreed to reschedule the substantial medium-term debts accumulated by the CPP government. It sought assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in response to the balance of payments crisis in 1965/66 and devalued the currency. The PNDC government fashioned out an economic recovery programme (ERP) in 1983. Pursuing the economic recovery programme made Ghana the pet of donors. By the end of the 1980s, Ghana was receiving more foreign aid per capita than the average for Africa and other developing countries. The shift to democracy in late 1992 led to further development assistance from the West, and Ghana's economic recovery continued. In the early 2000s, The Kufuor’s New Patriotic Party government focused much on continuing to develop Ghana's economy and international reputation. Ghana benefitted from Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) relief of $4.2 billion dollars after the HIPC completion point in 2004. Ghana's Jubilee Oilfield which contains up to 3 billion barrels of crude oil was discovered in 2007. Ghana’s GDP more than quadrupled between 2001 and 2008. In November 2010, Ghana joined the ranks of Lower Middle-Income Countries. Ghana's position, however, is at the lowest ebb of the lower-middle-income countries. Starting from Guggisberg’s Ten-Year Development Plan (1920-1930), Ghana has prepared 19 development plans to help address development challenges. Seven of the development plans were stipulated within the Fourth Republican democratic dispensation. It is important to emphasize the fact that the implementation of many of our development plans was truncated mid-way. This was often due to poor implementation strategies, the paucity of resources after initial investments and for reasons of political expediency. Ghana joined the IMF on September 20, 1957. Whenever our economy is sick we go to the IMF for diagnosis. Ghana has had 16 programs with the IMF. On the average, every three years and nine months Ghana goes back to the IMF for economic stabilization package. Ghana has attained success in macroeconomic policy reform with the IMF interventions as measured by the various national level indicators but less in terms of institutional and structural change as measured by the various household level indicators. In the current Post-IMF period, Ghana can secure the Fund’s advice and support without a borrowing arrangement. The President has stated the determination to stop the over-dependence on foreign partners to finance the country's budget. The “Ghana beyond aid agenda” is a laudable vision and must be action-oriented to empower the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) to collect taxes for the country with optimum efficiency. The African Development Bank estimates that Ghana’s annual infrastructure deficit stands at about US$2.5 billion. The bottlenecks to infrastructure development in Ghana include a weak legal and institutional framework, poor project planning and corruption. A study by Global Financial Integrity estimated that between 1960 and 2012, Ghana lost about $40 billion through trade mis-invoicing. Corruption, especially in the procurement of goods and services, is estimated at some 1.5% of Ghana’s GDP annually. The 62-year old Ghana must be committed to preventing procurement fraud by strictly enforcing the Public Financial Management Act, 2016 (Act 921) and the Public Procurement (Amendment) Act 2016 (Act 914). The 62-year old Ghana must follow the East Asian giants by changing our traditional resource endowments and comparative advantages to a more skilled and knowledge intensive system. Our development thinking must be guided by improvement in national security, employment, infrastructural development, debt sustainability, fiscal discipline, financial soundness and enhanced revenue mobilization. Political parties would do the nation a great service if they ensure that they relate their manifestoes to a development vision of the entire nation. We need t of leaders and stakeholders to convert the popular will into action to redefine development towards the achievement of the 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs), as well as the Africa Union Agenda 2063.

# Tennis: Venus overcomes illness to advance at Indian Wells

INDIAN WELLS, Calif. (Reuters) - Venus Williams played through illness to win a seesaw opening round match against German Andrea Petkovic 6-4 0-6 6-3 at the BNP Paribas Open on Thursday. Williams, who said she was not feeling 100 percent, saved her best tennis for the biggest moments, breaking Petkovic for a sixth time in the final game to make up for a dismal second set. Asked in an on-court interview to describe the encounter, the 38-year-old former world number one was almost at a loss for words. “I don’t know honestly. I’m still trying to figure it out,” she said to laughs from the crowd on a sunny and windy day in the California desert. “Every day is not your best day but that doesn’t mean the heart and desire aren’t there.” The win sets up a mouthwatering second-round clash with third seed Petra Kvitova, who holds a 4-2 edge in their previous meetings.

# Climate deal is ok under Morrison: Abbott

Tony Abbott no longer wants Australia to pull out of the Paris climate deal, now that Malcolm Turnbull isn't overseeing the nation's plan to reduce emissions. The former prime minister said he only signed Australia up to the landmark 2015 international agreement because he believed the target to cut emissions could be met "without substantial policy change and without significant additional costs on the economy". Then after Mr Turnbull ousted him and took over as prime minister, Mr Abbott called for Australia to follow Donald Trump's lead and dump the get out of the agreement. Now he's changed his mind. "I certainly thought a few months ago that the only way to break the emissions obsession was to pull out of Paris," he told a Warringah candidates panel in Sydney on Friday. "I think that the government has lost its emissions obsession now that Angus Taylor is the energy minister so I don't think it is now necessary ... I'm not calling for us to pull out." When asked what circumstances had changed, Mr Abbott was blunt: "We've got a new prime minister and a new energy minister." The last straw for agitators against Mr Turnbull's leadership - including Mr Abbott - last August was his national energy guarantee policy, which would have required electricity generators to cut emissions while meeting reliability standards. Current prime minister Scott Morrison has recently announced a $2 billion extension to Mr Abbott's emission reduction fund - now rebadged as the climate solutions fund - and Commonwealth funding for Mr Turnbull's pet hydro-electricity project Snowy 2.0.<|im_end|>

# Freeriding in Andermatt+Sedrun+Disentis

The Andermatt+Sedrun+Disentis ski area in Switzerland is one of the finest freeride hotspots in the Western Alps, boasting diverse terrain and almost endless freeride runs.  The snow is plentiful and no matter which direction the wind is coming from.  The utmost in freeride service  A regular visitor to Andermatt+Sedrun+Disentis, Jacob is a great skier with a hectic job, so he always hires a qualified mountain guide to make sure he gets the most from his limited time on the snow. This means he can be safely shown the area’s finest freeride spots.  Jacob meets his guide, Urs, in Disentis, next to the valley station of the Disentis-Caischavedra aerial tram. A few years younger than Jacob, Urs is friendly and well prepared, and as standard here, freeride skis, shovel, probe, avalanche airbag backpack, avalanche transceiver and lift ticket are included when you book a guide.  The pair take the large-capacity gondola to the top station of the Gendusas-Lai Alv lift, and reach the entrance to Val Segnas. After checking their avalanche transceivers, they set out into the off-piste terrain.  The wide slopes down to the valley are a great place to start the day, and having hired a pair of the latest powder skis, Jacob is confidently floating through the snow.  Off to the Val Acletta  The Val Acletta, with its gullies and hollows, is exposed to a variety of influences. It takes time and experience to assess the avalanche situation, which is why it’s best left to a guide.  Jacob and Urs hike up a few metres from the top of the Lai Alv-Piz Ault drag lift to get a better line, and as they descend they have the wide valley basin to themselves. Urs stops regularly to check the slope before deciding where is safe, and they glide east, towards the gentle slopes of the lower Val Acletta.  In the late morning they treat themselves to some incredibly beautiful descents in the pristine powder. After several runs, Jacob starts to feel his legs getting tired, so they take a break on the Andermatt-Gotthard train, which runs from Disentis to Andermatt.  “In Switzerland they say ‘Znüni’ or ‘Zvieri’ for a snack,” says Urs. They unpack sandwiches, and munch away with relish. Jacob may have preferred a fondue in one of the ski huts, but on a freeride day the priority is powder, and lots of it.  Andermatt and Sedrun – deep and steep  At the valley station in Andermatt, Jacob and Urs find themselves again among powder fiends carrying wide skis and avalanche backpacks. They’re all here for one thing – the Gemsstock – the freeride paradise that peaks at 2,961m above Andermatt.  Its shady, snowy and steep gullies and depressions are a powder heaven, but they require experience. “Beginners can learn how to handle avalanche transceivers at the avalanche training centre just below the middle station of the Gemsstockbahn gondola,” says Urs.  The pair enjoy the view from the top for a moment, then, skipping the classic and fast downhill runs like Felsental, Giraffe or Guspis, Urs leads Jacob to some less frequented valleys, gullies and couloirs. Feeling challenged, it’s rewarding to be back in Andermatt again.  Keen for one more run, this time they cruise from the Gemsstock via Guspis to the Hospental. The 10-kilometre-long descent through the valley is easy and a well-deserved break for their leg muscles.  Finally, meet the Giraffe  Jacob and Urs end the day on one of Andermatt+Sedrun+Disentis’s most extreme freeride routes, the Giraffe. It’s one of the more challenging descents from the Gemsstock and heads towards Unteralptal.  The entry couloir is steep, there are no escape routes and local knowledge is essential, which is why the slope is still pretty much unspoilt in the afternoon. The run is an epic 8km descent, and they arrive at the bottom, covered in snow and with huge grins on their faces.  Freeriding in Andermatt+Sedrun+Disentis is simply excellent – the guides take care of everything, the only thing you have to do is ski. Descents are available for all levels, ranging from difficult to easy, steep to challenging and long to easy-going.  The mountains boast an abundance of snow, and even a few days after the last snowfall there is still untracked terrain. And of course, the region also offers top-notch mountain huts, hotels and après ski. What else could you ask for?  Need to know  The “Swiss Plus” mark of approval is found across all the activities, in all the locations and on all the slopes of the Andermatt+Sedrun+Disentis region. So why wait any longer?

# Russian officials charge owners of ‘whale prison’ | WTOP

MOSCOW (AP) — Russian officials have brought charges against four companies in the Far East which have been keeping some 100 whales in small, crowded pools that environmentalists have dubbed a “whale prison.”  The companies, which appear to be affiliated, have previously been fined for illegal capture and have a history of selling the animals to amusement parks abroad.  The Border Guards Department said Thursday that it suspects that the four companies captured the whales illegally. It also confirmed the environmentalists’ claims that the belugas and orcas are kept in cramped conditions in a marine containment facility near Vladivostok and that they need to be released back. The border guards did not specify, however, when it will happen. The border guards appear to be taking a cue from President Vladimir Putin who last week ordered authorities to investigate the case and release the animals.  Whales are worth a fortune on the black market, and the activists believe that they were captured for sale to amusements parks in China. Russian law only allows for the capture of whales for “scientific” purposes.  Activists raised the alarm late last year when the whales were captured off the Pacific Coast.  Ninety belugas and 12 orcas were originally reported to have been kept in a marine containment facility in Srednyaya Bay, near Vladivostok, but local prosecutors said on Thursday that three belugas appear to have escaped. Environmentalists also reported the disappearance of one orca earlier in February.  The whales are kept at one location off the Pacific Coast but are owned by four separate companies. Company records and court filings, however, indicate that they are connected. In an interview with Russian state TV last year, a representative for the facility rejected reports of poor treatment of the animals.  One of the companies unsuccessfully sued the Federal Fishery Agency in 2017 over its refusal to issue it a quota for capturing unidentified marine mammals. The 2017 ruling shows that the company had a standing contract with a company in China’s northeast and that the company was unable to prove that the whales would be kept in good conditions and used for educational purposes. The city of Weihai in the Shandong province hosts an ocean amusement park.  Copyright © 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

# Gondola dining experience at Blue Plate raise $25,000 for Pink Vail

Gondola dining experience at Blue Plate raise $25,000 for Pink Vail March 7, 2019 There's a new way to dine at The Blue Plate in Avon. Owners Adam and Elli Roustom are now offering an exclusive dining experience in two vintage gondolas nestled on the restaurant's East patio. Refurbished with old European wood by Arrigoni Woods and traditional Austrian textiles, each private cabin embodies the luxurious warmth of a Alpine chalet. Up to four guests will be able to choose between two special menus: an Alpine menu or Chef's tasting menu. The alpine menu will feature European charcuterie, traditional fondue with imported cheeses, crispy Austrian schnitzel and apple strudel. The Chef's tasting menu is determined weekly by Adam. He bases his menu on the freshest seasonal ingredients and enjoys being creative with the colors and flavors in his dishes. Both menus will be four courses, and guests may choose to add wine pairings. The new Blue Plate gondolas were presented for the first time at an exclusive fundraising dinner to benefit Pink Vail on Feb. 27, and the first two four-course dinner reservations in the gondolas were auctioned off to support the charity. The party also featured a five-course menu, elite silent auction and live music by the Fabulous Femmes and the Sam Bee trio. The event raised more than $25,000 for the Shaw Cancer Center via the Pink Vail Charity, which is one of the highest individual event donations the organization has received.

# Cardinals’ Yadier Molina singles in return from knee surgery

JUPITER, Fla. — Leaving the clubhouse following his first exhibition game this year, St. Louis catcher Yadier Molina received a congratulatory fist bump from third baseman Matt Carpenter. “It’s good to have you back,” said Carpenter, one All-Star to another. Molina went 1 for 2 as a designated hitter Friday, the 36-year-old’s first game since left knee surgery in mid-December. Molina is likely to be behind the plate on Saturday, catching Adam Wainwright against Houston — about a week ahead of the original projection for him to catch. “I can’t really tell you how happy I am just to be back with Waino,” Molina said. A nine-time All-Star and nine-time Gold Glove, Molina singled through the left side off Patrick Corbin and scored in a three-run Cardinals’ first. “Just proves yet again he’s a special guy,” St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said. “Comes in, first at-bat, gets down 0-2 and battles, battles, battles. It’s impressive to see a guy that takes a pro at-bat like that — that can work on getting his timing as the at-bat goes.” Molina then lined out to first. “I was nervous about how I was going to feel but that’s a good nervous and everything feels fine, everything feels good with my body,” Molina said. “I’m happy to be back and part of the team again.” Marcel Ozuna replaced Molina at designated hitter, striking out twice. Ozuna, hitless in 14 spring training at-bats, had right shoulder surgery on Oct. 30. He is slated to join outfielders in throwing drills on Saturday and could make his first outfield appearance on Monday in left. “I think it’s going to help when he gets into games because that flow of play will get him in a little bit of rhythm,” Shildt said. ——<|im_end|>

# Trump budget will seek funds for border wall, Space Force

President Donald Trump will be making a significant request for border wall funds and seeking money to start up Space Force as a new branch of the military in the White House budget being released next week.  That's according to an administration official who was unauthorized to discuss the document ahead of its release and spoke on condition of anonymity.  For the first time, Trump plans to stick with the strict spending caps imposed years ago, even though lawmakers have largely avoided them with new budget deals. That will likely trigger a showdown with Congress.  The official says the president's plan promises to balance the budget in 15 years.

# Mutual funds: Inflows into equity funds lowest in 25 months

The data from Amfi also shows that, mutual fund industry saw outflows of Rs 20,083 crore in February. Inflows into pure equity schemes of mutual funds in February slipped to the lowest levels in 25 months at Rs 3,948 crore. Market participants attribute the continuous fall in equity inflows to the very poor performance by mutual fund managers. A study of around 360 open-ended equity schemes by Valueresearch showed 67% of them have given negative returns in the last one year. In January, equity funds had seen inflows of Rs 5,082 crore while in December 2018, they had attracted only a very small Rs 4,442 crore, the lowest in 27 months. Equity funds includes, equity funds, arbitrage funds and equity linked saving schemes (ELSS). While debt funds includes income schemes, liquid/money market schemes, and gilt schemes. However if we look at pure equity funds, than it saw inflows of Rs 3,948 crore lowest in the last 25 months. ELSS schemes saw inflows of Rs 1,174 crore, while arbitrage funds saw outflows of Rs 482 crore in the month of February, showed data from Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi). If we just look at pure equity funds than, February marks fourth consecutive month of fall in inflows. In the month of January and December, pure equity funds had seen inflows of Rs 4,914 crore and Rs 5,765 crore respectively. The average monthly inflows into equity schemes in the period of April-February slowed down at Rs 9,110 crore from Rs 14,200 crore in 2017-18. “Markets have remained volatile and many investors might have redeemed the money or stopped their lump-sum investments. though flows have slowed down on equity side, contribution of systematic investment plan (SIPs) have continued to remain strong which is very positive,” said a CEO of the leading fund house. Despite flows slowing down in equity funds, contribution of SIPs stood at over Rs 8,095 crore in February as against Rs 8,064 crore in January. Market participants also say that, investments through lump-sums slowing down in the last few months, due to uncertainty in the markets. In the period from April to February, total contribution of SIPs stood at Rs 84,638 crore. In the last financial year the contribution of SIPs was Rs 67,190 crore while in 2016-17 it was Rs 43,921 crore. The data from Amfi shows that, debt funds witnessed outflows of Rs 28,872 crore in February. Liquid funds and income funds saw net outflows of Rs 24,509 crore and Rs 4,214 crore, respectively in February. While gilt funds saw outflows of Rs 149 crore, shows the data from Amfi. NS Venkatesh, CEO of Amfi, said, “Amid global uncertainty, tension at the border, liquidity tightness and credit events, retail investor behaviour to stay invested is quite heartening. The continued healthy confidence that retail investors are showing, as is reflected in rising number of SIP inflows is laudable. The patience to stay invested amid uncertainty, will help from the individual long term wealth creation perspective. Once political uncertainty and liquidity tightness recedes over the next few months, we expect the inflows in both equity and liquid funds to strengthen further.” The data from Amfi also shows that, mutual fund industry saw outflows of Rs 20,083 crore in February. Other exchange traded funds also saw net inflows of Rs 5,234 crore in February. Balanced funds saw outflows of Rs 1,077 crore in the month of February. The assets under management of mutual fund industry stood at Rs 23.16 lakh crore.<|im_end|>

# Stanley Cup excites fans in Portland

PORTLAND, Maine — Hockey fans had the chance to see the Stanley Cup up close and personal Friday night in Portland. The fancy hardware was at the C-N Brown landing at the Cross Insurance Arena, as the Maine Mariners took on the South Carolina Stingrays March 8. Fans who bought tickets to the game were able to take pictures with the Cup.  The Cup is the oldest championship trophy in all of professional sports. It has been given to the NHL champion since 1926 -- a tradition lasting almost a century. Individual names of each player who wins the Cup are engraved on the trophy. Players from the winning team of the championship take turns hoisting the Cup on the ice. The NHL affiliate of the South Carolina Stingrays, the Washington Capitals, are the most recent Stanley Cup champions. Barry Trotz was the head coach of the Capitals at the time of their win. He was also the first coach of the Portland Pirates. The Pirates won the Calder Cup in his first season. The last time the Stanley Cup was in Maine was when Brian Dumoulin of Biddeford brought it to town after he and the Pittsburgh Penguins won in 2016. Maine fans were happy to have the Cup back Friday -- even if just for a quick picture.<|im_end|>

# Ducks rookie Max Jones relieved after first NHL goal

ANAHEIM — Max Jones accepted a pass from Ducks teammate Josh Manson in their own end of the ice Friday at Honda Center. Jones skated the puck out of trouble and into the neutral zone as the final seconds ticked down. He picked up speed and then shouldered his way past an opponent. Jones, a 21-year-old left wing, raced into the attacking zone, shifted the puck one way and then another before unleashing a shot that beat goaltender Carey Price and hit the back of the net with 11 seconds remaining in the Ducks’ 8-2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens.  Jones’ momentum took him into the left corner of the rink. He raised his arms in triumph and looked toward the heavens as what remained of a non-sellout crowd of 16,580 erupted with a sustained roar that signified something greater than the scoring of an eighth goal in a blowout victory. In fact, it was Jones’ first NHL goal and it had been a long time coming. Jones reacted with a sense of relief mixed with celebration. The fans reacted with a surprising sense of appreciation for what he had been going through, the missed chances and foiled opportunities piling up to a great height as the games passed without a goal to call his own. Jones’ first goal came on his final shift of his 17th game, and it could have not happened just as easily. After all, the Ducks were ahead 7-2 when he picked up the puck and there were only a few seconds remaining. He could have just as easily shot the puck into the corner and let the clock run out. “It just happened so fast,” he said. “I knew the period was running down and I had my last chance to take it. I decided to go with it and see what I could do. So much pressure was on my shoulders just from trying to get that first one.” Jones’ older brother, Mitch, who plays with Cincinnati in the ECHL, tried to ease the pressure. So did his father, Brad, who played 148 games during a six-year career with the Kings, Winnipeg Jets and Philadelphia Flyers, and his mother, Mary Bailey, an NCAA champion diver at Michigan. Mitch Jones sent Max a text late Thursday, urging him to hang in there. “I was going through a real hard time there,” Max Jones said. “It’s not easy trying to get that first one, especially since the games are limited and the season’s coming down to an end. They really kept me cool. … My family was really behind me, calling me and making sure I was all right.” Jones explained that he went through similar struggles while in the junior-level Ontario Hockey League and with the San Diego Gulls of the American Hockey League before finally breaking through with his first goal. This was all the more difficult because it was in the NHL, the best league in hockey. “The amount of chances I had was ridiculous,” he said. “I almost wanted to send a tweet out and try to be funny. But I was just, like, ‘I need to stay focused right now.’ It was actually ridiculous the number of chances I had. It was unbelievable. To finally get that one, it’s a sigh of relief. “The crowd was pretty loud for an eighth goal. They knew it was my first one.” RITCHIE FINED  The NHL fined Nick Ritchie $4,121.86 for cross-checking the Canadiens’ Christian Folin in the first period Friday, the maximum allowable. Ritchie was given a minor penalty for roughing at 14:04, after knocking Folin to the ice following an exchange between Folin and Troy Terry of the Ducks. TERRY SIZZLES  With a career-high three assists in the Ducks’ 5-4 loss Wednesday to the St. Louis Blues and one goal and two assists in their victory Friday over the Canadiens, Terry became the first Ducks rookie to record back-to-back three-point games.<|im_end|>

# How to give your home the clean air cure

Forget clean eating; clean breathing is set to be the big 2019 health trend. Because while we can decide which food we eat, it’s much harder to control the air we breathe.  The Government’s Clean Air Strategy, published earlier this year, focuses on cleaning up pollution in our air. It is particularly concerned with the fine particles, known as PM2.5, which are now a major health concern; at about 200 times smaller than a grain of sand, they can penetrate into your bloodstream.  While wood-burning stoves, open fires and farming methods have come under major scrutiny, our homes are among the most toxic environments, according to experts.

# STATE MATS DAY 2 NOTES: Perry finalist streak comes to an end

Max Millin's loss in heavyweight semifinal ends 18-year run of Panthers in the state finals; Olivia Shore's place hopes dashed; dozen from Stark area place.  COLUMBUS Perry has wrestlers on its team who can remember the last time it left a state tournament without having an individual wrestle for a championship. Those wrestlers may have been in diapers at the time, but they were alive. For the Panthers, a impressive run of 18 consecutive years with at least one wrestler - more often than not, multiple wrestlers - in the state finals came to an end on Friday night. When Max Millin was pinned by top-ranked Jacob Padilla in the Division I heavyweight semifinals, it marked the first time since 2000 Perry did not have at least one semifinal winner. Not that Millin didn't make a run at continuing the streak. He led 1-0 15 seconds into the second period against Padilla. Padilla would capitalize on a ill-fated reach by Millin on the edge of the mat with just over a minute left in the second. The Wayne junior got a hold of him, rolled him over and secured the pin and the title-match berth. "He came a little bit out of position," Perry coach Brent McBurney said. "Max was asking me, 'What the heck did he just do to me?' He used his weight, whizzered him and it happened. Against a good heavyweight, that's going to happen." Millin, who will wrestle in Saturday morning's consolation semifinals, will continue one Perry streak, consecutive seasons with at least one state placer. The last time the Panthers didn't have a placer was 1998. The consecutive years with a finalist streak which ended was the second-longest active streak entering the tournament behind Division II power St. Paris Graham, which last went without a finalist in 1994. Perry's streak began in 2001 when then-freshman Steve Luke finished second to St. Edward's Mark Moos for the 112-pound title. Luke would be the first of 45 state finalists for the program over those 18 years, with 30 of those winning state titles. The most finalists for a given season was seven in 2014, the year the Panthers won the state team championship, while they had four champions in 2012 (Zach Dailey, Mitch Newhouse, David Bavery and JoJo Tayse). "It does say a lot about the program," McBurney said. "It's crazy. Of all those guys who make the finals, we win probably 68-, 69-percent of them. ... Yeah, we need to get some in the finals next year." Shoregal Miami East’s Olivia Shore (106) might have come up a bit short after falling to Hawken’s Patrick Reineke 10-7 in the second round of consolation, but will return with a ton of motivation. Only a sophomore, she reached the quarterfinal before Milan Edison’s Alec Homan fought off a late takedown from Shore in the waning moments to win 4-2. Just missing isn’t in the two-time World Team member’s vocabulary, so expect fireworks next season. "I’m just going to go home and work on stuff," Shore said. "I can’t really describe the feeling (of being on the floor wrestling). I’m happy that I made it here. Falling short sucks, but I’ll be back." Podium count The Stark County area is assured of a dozen state placers when the tournament ends Saturday night. Louisville in Division II and Tuslaw in Division III each lead the way with four placers. Perry (Millin) and Green (132-pounder Caleb Graber) in Division I, Minerva (106-pounder Drake Decker) in Division II and Manchester (126-pounder Zach Larue) in Division III each will have a single placer. Summer work The work wrestlers do outside of the season showcased itself in a major way through two days of the tournament. That was especially true in the big-school Of the 56 Division I semifinalists, 54 wrestle freestyle in the summer. Fourteen of the top 16 teams heading into the semifinals have freestyle wrestling clubs, and the two which don't - Avon and Dublin Coffman - go to other clubs. Mural mania Phase 2 of the Legends of wrestling adorned the walls around the arena this weekend. The mural, which honors three-and four-time state champions is now up to the year 1989. When the final phase is completed, it will include four-timers John McGhee (Coventry), Harry Lester (CVCA), Dustin Schlatter (Perry), David Carr (Perry) and Tomasello. Three-timers Clint Musser (Walsh Jesuit), Joseph Heskett (Walsh), Jeff Knupp (Walsh), Johnni DiJulius (Walsh), Steve Luke (Perry), Mike Miller (Lake), Ty Mitch (Aurora) and Nick Tavanello (Wadsworth) will join them with a chance for CVCA’s Jacob and Jordan Decatur coming from this season’s crop. Back in Buckeye country Olympic champion and two-time World Champion Kyle Snyder and CVCA four-time state champion Nathan Tomasello spent some time in the concourse signing autographs at the RUDIS stand. Both standouts are under contract with the company that was co-founded by Highland two-time state champion Jesse Leng.<|im_end|>

# Someone Paid R. Kelly’s Child Support Bill, Released From Jail

R. Kelly is a free man, again. Yesterday (Mar. 9), the singer paid the $160,000 in back child support he owed and was thus released from jail.  The question now is, who paid the bill? Because it wasn’t R’uh. He even spoke to assembled reporters after leaving the Cook County Jail.  Reports the Chicago Tribune:  “Thanks for the order, guys,’’ Kelly said as he stood behind several microphones set up by reporters and cameramen who earlier had been ordered to move onto a sidewalk away from the jail gates.  Grasping a white manila folder with his right hand, he gesticulated with his left hand, saying, “I promise you we’re gonna straighten all this stuff out. … That’s all I can say right now.’’  “I love my fans. I love y’all … appreciate it,’’ he said as the side door of a black van slid open and he entered. An adoring female fan told him she loved him and pleaded with Kelly to touch her hand.  Cara Smith, chief policy officer at the sheriff’s office, said a check for the full amount of Kelly’s back child support had been handed over to the circuit court clerk’s office.  A copy of the receipt does not list who paid the amount owed, $161,663, because the benefactor chose to remain anonymous.  The woman who previously posted R. Kelly’s bail has been receiving threats, so you can’t blame them. But what are the odds that said benefactor is a fan or woman?  The struggle continues.  —  Photo: Getty<|im_end|>

# England's 23 squad members all train ahead of Czech Republic European Qualifier

England's 23 squad members all train ahead of Czech Republic European Qualifier  Marcus Rashford, Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander-Arnold worked away from squad after tough weekend games  By Sky Sports News  Last Updated: 19/03/19 2:40pm  England were at full strength as they stepped up preparations for the start of the European Qualifiers against the Czech Republic.  All 23 players called up by Gareth Southgate were involved at St George's Park on Tuesday, with no injury concerns among those who made up his final squad. Southgate lost the services of Fabian Delph, John Stones, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Luke Shaw on Monday, calling up Callum Hudson-Odoi and James Ward-Prowse as replacements.  Trent Alexander-Arnold, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford worked in the gym with England's medical team feeling they had endured a tough workload over the weekend. None of the trio are injury doubts for Friday's clash, Sky Sports News understands. Chelsea winger Hudson-Odoi and in-form Southampton midfielder Ward-Prowse worked with the rest of the squad, which was bolstered by Burnley youngster Dwight McNeil, who is in the U20 squad, and goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, on loan at AFC Wimbledon from Bournemouth. Ross Barkley and Michael Keane only trained during the first half of the session before heading off to do individual work with England's training staff.  England take on the Czech Republic at Wembley on Friday night in their opening qualifying match for Euro 2020 before heading off to Montenegro for their first away qualifier on Monday. The two games are Southgate's last international matches before June's Nations League finals in Portugal, where England take on the Netherlands for a place in the final.<|im_end|>

# People told Mahdi the Magician his body would make his dreams impossible — but he refused to quit | CBC Arts

People told Mahdi the Magician his body would make his dreams impossible — but he refused to quit 'I decided even if it's difficult, I'm going to pursue it to the end' Mahdi Gilbert didn't have dreams growing up because the people around him would convince him out of them. "One of my teachers told me I shouldn't use my body because my body 'isn't any good,'" the Canadian magician, who was born without hands or feet, tells filmmaker Jason D'Souza. "[They said] that I should use my mind because my mind is still good." But then, at 17, he found something to be passionate about: slight of hand. Despite discovering that most of the literature about his newfound passion were written by two-handed magicians for other two-handed magicians, Gilbert would make it work for him and practice through the night. "It was just working and failing every night," the Toronto native says. Watch the video: He remembers almost giving up after a particularly bad night. "I had the worst feeling in the world," he remembers. "A feeling of just total hopelessness." But, he thought, if he gave up on this thing — something that he really wanted and really loved — he would just continue to give up on anything challenging in his life. "I decided even if it's difficult, I'm going to pursue it to the end." That was 12 years ago. Now he shares stages with the likes of David Blaine, Penn and Teller and other luminaries in the magic world. "I went from thinking that nobody would want to see what I was doing to travelling around the world and hundreds of millions of people seeing my magic."<|im_end|>

# Louisiana Open: Matt Gilchrest might live in Texas, but he knows all about Le Triomphe

BROUSSARD — Matt Gilchrest has been a professional for less than two years, but his golfing life has already come full-circle. Twelve years ago in 2007, the 12-year-old Gilchrest was a volunteer at the Chitimacha Louisiana Open, part of the hundreds of volunteers that make the 28-year-old tournament happen. He walked the course carrying one of the portable scoreboard standards in early rounds — but on championship Sunday, he was scheduled as one of the walking scorers that are assigned to each group. Only one problem: Tee times were moved up for the final round because of the threat of bad weather. “I didn’t have a cell phone, so I missed my tee time,” Gilchrest said. “There’s only a few groups left by the time I got here, but the guy that was supposed to do the last group didn’t show up.” Gilchrest took advantage and was assigned as walking scorer for a final group that included Skip Kendall and Jarrod Lyle, and Kendall eventually won the 2007 title in a playoff with Paul Claxton. “(Kendall) stuck around after getting the trophy, took a picture with me and signed a ball,” Gilchrest said. “I still have that ball. That day, it was like, this pro golfing is pretty cool.” Fast forward 12 years, and Gilchrest is in the field for the $550,000 Web.com Tour event that kicks off Thursday at Le Triomphe Golf & Country Club. It’ll be his first start on the Web.com Tour after turning pro in 2017, playing on the PGA Tour’s Mackenzie Tour-Canada the rest of that year and on PGA Tour Latinoamerica in 2018. “It’s incredible for two reasons,” Gilchrest said. “I’m so grateful to be here. Since I’m a conditional member, this is my first start, and if I play well I can earn a full season out here. But for this first start to be here, the one that hopefully gets the ball rolling, where I have all the history, incredible is an understatement.” Gilchrest played the Le Triomphe course a minimum of twice a week for four years between the ages of 9 and 12, when his family lived in Lafayette. He played some with his father Eric, an avid golfer, and took lessons from current Le Triomphe director of instruction Chris Popp. “The mom of one of the boys I was teaching recommended me to his mom,” Popp said. “For him to be back here playing this week, that’s pretty cool.” Gilchrest attended Ascension Day School and St. Pius Elementary before his family returned to the Dallas area in 2007. That’s when he and his father began playing regularly. “He commuted from Chicago and back,” Gilchrest said. “He loved golf, and my mom thought he should spend time with me, so on the weekends we’d go play together. When I was young, I was always getting out of the cart and never stayed quiet, so he’d get me McDonald’s super-sized french fries and that would keep me quiet for nine holes. I guess I was just around it enough and soaked it up. It was bonding time.” Gilchrest played collegiately at Auburn before turning pro, and played 10 events in Canada that year with a top finish in eighth in his second pro event. In 2018 he finished eighth overall on the Latinoamerica money list ($69,689) and made 12 of 17 cuts with six top-10 finishes, which gave him conditional status on this year’s Web.com Tour. “It’s tough going to other countries and faraway places for golf,” he said. “It’s what we love doing, but it’s not that easy. It’s hard. A person with a regular job, you still get paid on the bad days. We don’t. So I’m thrilled to be one state over from where I live this week.” He began applying for the one available Tour exemption in January, and was at his Southlake, Texas, home Friday when he got the news that he’d made the field. “He has a zest for life,” said Louisiana Open executive director Danny Jones. “I’ve gotten to know him over the last couple of months. In a day and age where agents have taken over and so many agents call our office, he reached out and made a personal connection with me. The Web.com has one exemption every week and he asked if there was anything I could do, and how could I not go to bat for this kid. “The story is perfect, and I’m thrilled he got that phone call Friday.” Gilchrest estimated he played Le Triomphe more than 200 times while his family was here, and Popp caddy for him this week. But all of those long-ago rounds came from the red tees, typically reserved for ladies and juniors, and that won’t be the case when he tees off at 9:10 a.m. Thursday off the No. 10 tee. “I’d played here a lot so I don’t really have to learn it,” he said. “I remember the greens and around the greens a lot. But some of the lines are a little different. I hit it farther than I did when I was 10.”<|im_end|>

# Here’s what Penn State wrestling commit Carter Starocci said after winning another PIAA title

While Penn State was out crushing the competition at the Big Ten Wrestling Championships, Nittany Lions commit Carter Starocci pulverized the 182-pound field at the PIAA Class 3A tournament Saturday for his second state title.  The Erie Cathedral Prep senior destroyed his opponents in methodical fashion, scoring two falls, a major decision and a dominant 7-1 win in the finals over Mount Lebanon’s Luke Stout. Starocci finishes his senior season at a perfect 41-0. He also ends an impressive career with a 159-10 record and two PIAA titles, along with a runner-up and an eighth-place finish.  Starocci, ranked by InterMat as the nation’s second-best wrestler in his current weight class, won a 2018 PIAA title at 160 pounds.  “I felt really good this weekend and I was healthy; that’s the big thing,” Starocci said. “I was excited to wrestle. I knew it was my last time wrestling for coach Mike Hahesy — he’s like a second dad to me. I wanted to go out there and score as many bonus points as I could for him to get the team title, but we came up a little short.”  Sign Up and Save  Get six months of free digital access to the Centre Daily Times  #ReadLocal  Next on the agenda is a date at the Dapper Dan Classic this Friday at the University of Pittsburgh’s Fitzgerald Field House, where he meets Iowa recruit Abe Assad from Illinois.  With his prep career almost completed, it’s time for Starocci to focus on cracking a Penn State lineup loaded with talent. Mark Hall occupies 174 and Shakur Rasheed may or may not be back at 184, depending on his NCAA petition for another year. Even if Rasheed doesn’t return, Penn State has Aaron Brooks coming in after greyshirting.  It won’t be easy, but Starocci — who’ll arrive on campus later this year — has loads of confidence in his ability and the mindset of a true competitor.  “My mentality is my strength,” he said. “I feel I have the same mentality that they do at Penn State. I don’t care who I’m wrestling, whether it’s Kyle Snyder or Jordan Burroughs or a 5-year-old kid, I’m going out to crush you, score points and try to pin you. I can get better in all areas — top, bottom and on my feet. I can work on all that and I need to score more points in college.”  Starocci, ranked by FloWrestling as the nation’s No. 3 174-pound prospect at the time of his November commitment, had offers from most of the major wrestling programs in the country. In the end, he felt the decision to go to Penn State gave him the best opportunity to achieve his goals.  “Talking to my family, all my goals aligned with Penn State with everything they’ve provided other people who went there. It was an opportunity I wanted to take,” Starocci said. “I chose it for many reasons. One, I feel I can accomplish my goals there. They have a great coaching staff and a great team there. I just feel it’s the best place for me.”  Starocci found his path to the sport at an early age. He watched his older brother wrestle, and it wasn’t long before he fell in love with the sport himself.  He said the support from his family only solidified the fact he was on the right path. His father and uncle both watched him in Fargo, N.D., where he was a double winner in 2017 — and they were on-hand again Saturday to watch him win gold.  That family dynamic helped mold him into the person he is today, which is a good thing considering Penn State coach Cael Sanderson tested his self-discipline during his first recruiting visit during his high school junior season.  “It was the first dual where I had to make the weight to go to states and we went out to eat. He knew I was over and had to make weight for that Saturday,” Starocci remembered. “He ordered a large basket of fried corn dogs. He didn’t eat any of them and asked me like 15 times if I wanted to try one, and I kept saying no. Finally, he said, ‘Yeah, that’s not going to help you make weight, is it?’ And I said, ‘Not at all.’ It was interesting to see him do that.”  Starocci doesn’t know the plans Sanderson and his staff have for him next season but, no matter what, being part of the Penn State machine will only make him a better wrestler.  “I’m not sure what’s going to happen. I’ll be ready to go and win an NCAA title next year, but if I redshirt, I redshirt. If I don’t, I don’t,” Starocci said. “Every partner I have is going to be a blessing. It’s going to be awesome going into that room and getting better every day.”<|im_end|>

# Creed II (2018) (4K Ultra HD)

Movie Video Audio Extras Overall SYNOPSIS  “In the ring, you got rules. Outside, you got nothing. Life hits you with all these cheap shots. People like me, we live in the past. You got people that need you now. You got everything to lose, this guy has got nothing to lose.”  – Rocky Balboa CRITIQUE  Here’s what I wrote about Creed II back in my original theatrical review:  “Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) has emerged out of his late father Apollo Creed’s shadow. Thanks to the tutelage of his friend and mentor Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and the love of his longtime singer girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson), he is now the heavyweight champion of the world. He has done exactly what he set out to do, and for this one brief moment as far as Adonis is concerned all is right with the world.  But someone from out of both Rocky’s and his father’s past has come back to haunt the new champion. In the heart of the Ukraine, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) has been patiently training his son Viktor (Florian “Big Nasty” Munteanu) to be an even more unstoppable beast inside the ring than even he was. They have challenged Adonis to a bout, and it’s a fight the new champion feels he cannot turn down. Ivan is the man that inadvertently killed his father during their fight. Rocky is the one who, in his grief, subsequently went to Moscow and shocked the world by knocking Ivan out in front of his own countrymen. Adonis feels like he has to accept this fight no matter what the consequences, worrying he’ll disappear back behind his father’s massive silhouette if he fails to take down the son of the man who beat him to death three decades prior.  Creed II is a direct sequel to 2015’s surprise hit Creed and also 1985’s Rocky IV. It brings back characters from both those as films as well as ones from other Rocky entries. It gives Phylicia Rashad a tiny bit more to do as Adonis’ mother Mary Anne Creed. Screenwriters Stallone and Juel Taylor give just as much credence to the Ivan/Viktor storyline as they do the Rocky/Adonis one. New director Steven Caple Jr. (The Land) deftly follows in previous filmmaker Ryan Coogler’s (Black Panther, Fruitvale Station) footsteps by insisting the drama remain focused on the characters and their respective journeys above any and everything else. It’s an incredibly well-realized motion picture that continues on the enduring legacy of the previous films yet also manages to make its own individualistic mark as well. In short, it’s a darn good sequel, and it’s safe to say I kind of loved just about every single second of it.  At the same time it’s obvious we’ve ventured outside of Coogler’s original vision displayed to such vibrant meticulousness in the last film and have instead strayed back into the one Stallone spent three decades perfecting while working on six different Rocky films beginning with the Academy Award-winning original in 1976 and culminating with his triumphant final chapter Rocky Balboa in 2006. Not only does he bring back the protagonist of Rocky IV, he also throws in a troubled pregnancy subplot culled from Rocky II and the initially reluctant trainer narrative beat from Rocky III. Additionally, as terrific as both Rashad and Thompson might be, and the latter is electrifying stealing scenes left and right from Jordan with magnetic forcefulness, the women are still relegated into the background, their wants, needs and desires secondary to that of the men sharing their lives.  In short, it’s back to basics right down to returning composer Ludwig Göransson’s (Venom) heavy utilization of Oscar-winner Bill Conti’s original Rocky themes throughout the 130-minute drama. While he waits to unleash “Gonna Fly Now” until the ideal moment, the rest of Conti’s music can be heard so frequently it’s easy to wonder whether he came out of retirement to compose the score and Göransson’s name is there only as an alias, and while I’m likely being disingenuous in regards to how intricate the music here is, there’s still no denying this sequel sounds more like any one of the ‘80s entries in the series than it does Coogler’s film from just three years ago.  I’m nitpicking. But that still doesn’t mean I didn’t want more complexity as it pertained to Adonis and Bianca’s relationship; that I kept feeling like she needed to be her own woman who constructs her own life and not just be a feminine device to help augment her husband’s story at the expense of her own. Even so, it’s refreshing to see a relationship like the one these two shares in a major Hollywood sequel, the heat of their romantic passions genuinely palpable. More, Jordan and Thompson continue to showcase a fiery chemistry that burns through the screen, and I couldn’t have loved the both of them more whenever they were together if I had wanted to try.  The rest of the movie follows the general Rocky template right down to the overblown training montage. The fact it all works as well as it does is a testament to how rich the performances are as well as the kinetically captivating efficiency of Caple’s direction. I loved the way Stallone and Taylor’s script balances its screen time between Rocky, Adonis, Ivan and Viktor. The latter two are given a lot to do, the fervent depth of their relationship subtly speaking volumes as father and son both look for redemption even when they don’t always see eye-to-eye. Their familial love is real, and I adored the fact so much of the story is reliant upon it being so, and unlike Rocky IV where Ivan was the clear villain this time around he and Viktor are almost as sympathetic and worth rooting for as Adonis and Rocky unsurprisingly continue to be.  But all anyone is truly going to care about is the final confrontation between Adonis and Viktor and whether or not watching it is worth the price of admission. It is. While cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau’s (The Darkest Minds) camerawork isn’t nearly as gorgeously fluid as what Maryse Alberti brought to the last film, that doesn’t make his visual styling any less incredible. He brings a brutal urgency to the final fight that’s bruising in its dynamic intensity, each left hook or right jab an eye-popping punch to the gut that had me sitting at the edge of my seat eager to discover what was going to happen next.  In the end, Stallone continues to be perfect as Rocky Balboa and Jordan was born to portray Adonis Creed. Their relationship grows in a number of charismatic ways, the purity of their bond one I’m not about to take for granted. If this sequel isn’t quite the marvel it processor was that doesn’t make it any less entertaining, and whether for die-hard fans of the series who have been there since the beginning or for newcomers who just came to it on the strength of Coogler’s 2015 opus, Creed II is a pugnacious delight worth getting into the theatrical ring to see.”  Creed II is clearly a minor step down from its predecessor, Sylvester Stallone and Juel Taylor’s efficient of overly familiar script blatantly culling from the entire Rocky series for inspiration as far as the sequel’s melodramatic plotting is concerned. But it’s still incredibly entertaining, the dual storylines of parallel fathers (or father figures) and sons trying to figure out the more difficultly intimate parts of the relationship undeniably moving. This is a good movie, and for fans who have followed Rocky Balboa’s story since the beginning or for newcomers who became enamored only after Adonis Creed stood tall at the center of the ring this is a solid follow-up worthy of a look.  THE VIDEO  Creed II is presented on a 4K (2160p) Ultra HD disc with a 2.40:1 1080p transfer.  THE AUDIO  This 4K Ultra HD disc features English Dolby Atmos and English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 tracks along with French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 options and includes English SDH, French, Spanish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish subtitles.  THE EXTRAS  Extras are located on the included Blu-ray disc. These include:  “Fathers and Sons” Featurette (7:16)  “Casting Viktor Drago” Featurette (5:43)  “The Women of Creed II” Featurette (5:51)  “Rocky’s Legacy” Featurette (15:01)  Deleted Scenes (9:46)  A Digital HD copy of the film is also included with this release.  FINAL THOUGHTS  Creed II feels more like a Rocky sequel than it does a direct follow-up to 2015’s Academy Award-nominated Creed, but that doesn’t make it any less entertaining. Jordan and Stallone are once again excellent, while Lundrgen’s return as Rocky IV villain is far more emotionally complex and affecting than I anticipated it would be. Warner’s 4K Ultra HD package is a solid one that fans of the series will certainly want to add to their personal libraries.<|im_end|>

# Malik Jabir cautions Kotoko against CK Akonnor’s sack

Coach C.K Akonnor has come under scrutiny following the Porcupine Warriors' exit from the CAF Confederation Cup, with reports rife that the club is set to sack the former Ghana captain.  However, the rumours over Akonor's future has not been received well by most of the club's fans including Malik Jabir, who thinks the Reds should build the future around the 45-year-old.  “Sacking the coach won’t be the solution to the problems in the team but we must prepare and build a formidable team for the future,” he said.  “The management and the technical team should tackle the defensive problems because it affected the team from the start of the competition instead of thinking about sacking the coach,” he added.  C.K Akonnor joined Asante Kotoko last October on a three-year contract and was the first manager to lead the side to the group stages of the CAF Confederations since 2008.<|im_end|>

# New 'Get Windows 10' nag screen arrives in Windows 7

New 'Get Windows 10' nag screen arrives in Windows 7  When it was revealed a week ago that Microsoft would once again start nagging Windows 7 users into upgrading to Windows 10, there was a collective sigh of annoyance from devotees of the older OS who have lived through this sort of thing before.  This time though, Microsoft appears to have learned its lesson. Not only does the software giant have a valid reason for the popup notifications -- Windows 7 is nearing the end of its life -- but these alerts are optional, and gentler -- there’s no being tricked into upgrading to Windows 10 this time around (at least not yet).  The notification is arriving on Windows 7 machines in the form of KB 4493132, a patch Microsoft has labelled as optional in Windows Update.  There isn’t much documentation regarding it. The KB article says simply:   After 10 years of servicing, January 14, 2020, is the last day Microsoft will offer security updates for computers running Windows 7 SP1. This update enables reminders about Windows 7 end of support. More information about Windows 7 end of support can be found here.  This update is available through Windows Update. If automatic updates are enabled, this update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For more information about how to turn on automatic updating, see Windows Update: FAQ. Despite what the last paragraph says, so far the update isn't being downloaded and installed automatically, at least not so far as we're aware.  The original GWX nag screen was a nightmare that proved very hard to kill. This time though, Microsoft says you’ll be able to turn it off, and it will stay off. Obviously it remains to be seen if this is true, or if it continues to be the case, but we can but hope.  Have you encountered the new update notification screen yet?<|im_end|>

# With good boards under his feet and decision-making on point, Soli Bailey's ready to surf Snapper - National Indigenous Times

Byron Bay’s Soli Bailey is in Sydney preparing for his first ever World Surf League event appearance as a qualified CT surfer.  Bailey is competing alongside a host of other pros at Manly Beach in the QS 6000 event, the Vissla Sydney Surf Pro.  “I’m just using this as tuning up. Obviously a great result here will help me with a QS campaign throughout the year,” Bailey said.  “But it’s a good opportunity to work on choosing the right waves and making the right decisions. I’m really confident in my boards. My decision-making last year under pressure was all really good.”  Fellow CT surfers Ethan Ewing, Connor O’Leary, Jesse Mendes, Miguel Pupo and the GOAT Kelly Slater are also at the event.  Several female top flight surfers are competing as well, including Felicity Palmateer and Ellie Brooks. Alana Blanchard is making her return to competition at the event, after two years off.  Bailey went to Japan in the offseason to snowboard, after officially qualifying for the Championship Tour at the end of 2018.  He has spent the last month preparing for the season, which starts at Snapper Rocks on the Gold Coast in two weeks.  “I’ve sort of been taking it easy. Trying some new boards. We got some good barrels [on the Gold Coast] in the cyclone swell,” he said.  “It doesn’t feel any different. I suppose when I paddle out there [at Snapper] it’ll be a big stage and it’ll sink in. I’ll just have to surf smart, get some good waves.”  Bailey is only the second Indigenous surfer to make the Championship Tour after Dean ‘Dingo’ Morrison.  By Keiran Deck<|im_end|>

# Vijayakanth’s party turns right, but the leader is still silent

Vijayakanth’s party, the DMDK (Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam), has finally taken a call to sail with the AIADMK-BJP led front in Tamil Nadu after protracted negotiations and substantial bickering.  The party has settled to contest on four seats and was perhaps hoping for seven. Moreover, it was negotiating with the other front (DMK-Cong), checking out if there were any good offers. Its angst is that its rival the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) was getting seven seats while it was getting four. Both these parties have been vying for the same Vanniyar voter base in northern Tamil Nadu.  The scenes over the last week showed how the party had been driven to desperation to align with a front, as its experiment to lead a third front in 2016 Assembly election had led to a shocking defeat with not one candidate being elected to the TN assembly.  Moreover, questions of Vijayakanth’s ill health continue to dog the party as the actor has not spoken in public or has had a press conference for quite some time. The party is now run by his wife, his brother-in-law and of late his son. Even during the 2016 Assembly election campaign, he had at times sounded incoherent.  When Vijayakanth entered politics in 2005 after acting in around 130-odd films, it was a breath of fresh air and was seen as someone who could stand up and be counted in a state which had polarised itself between the DMK and the AIADMK. Though the Congress party had a presence in Tamil Nadu, it was always aligned with one or the other of the major Dravidian parties.  Vijayakanth was a star of some standing though never as big as Rajinikanth. In the tradition of the do-gooder hero fighting corruption and venality in the system, he made a mark. He gained recognition as someone whose films did well in rural centres. Unlike Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, voters recognise him as someone who stuck his head out when the going was tough, and he stood up to both Jayalalitha and Karunanidhi when it really mattered. He was seen as ‘authentic’ in a state plush with with empty slogans and grand ideologies.  Vijayakanth started off with around 8 per cent vote in 2006 Assembly elections which increased to around 10 per cent in the 2009 parliament elections. He performed well in local body elections too. As his voters were spread across the state, he could win only one seat in 2006 despite getting an 8 per cent vote. In both these elections, he contested alone and without any alliances.  He contested the 2011 assembly elections in alliance with Jayalalitha to defeat Karunanidhi and was sitting pretty with 29 seats in the Assembly. With strident criticism of Jayalalitha he was slowly becoming a focus of opposition politics, However, ill health and the lack of a strong party organisation proved a handicap.  His political charm and draw rested on the fact that he would not easily align with any of the major Dravidian parties but when he started aligning with one of them he started losing his selling point and narrative.  And unlike the other Dravidian parties, he did not place much emphasis on party manifestos or periodic party conferences. His was a more personalised approach and he had come to politics not as an ideologue but as a no-nonsense do-gooder. Even when he repeatedly slapped his partymen in public, his voters did not take it seriously. It was seen a sign of his ‘directness’ and lack of false modesty.  Now, his ill-health, poor party organisation and lack of a coherent narrative continue to haunt the party, but it remains to be seen if his fans and voters still recall him and connect with the shadow of the star.<|im_end|>

# More Expensive Your Wedding, the Greater Your Chance of Divorce

Study Shows the More Expensive Your Wedding, the Greater Your Chance of Divorce According to a new study, the more money you spend on your wedding the greater your chances of getting a divorce. The study also found "looks" plays a big part in it. The study was done by a couple of economics professors by the names of Andrew Francis-Tan and Hugo M. Mialon. They surveyed 3,000 married couples. And despite what bridal companies and jewelry stores would have you believe, the truth is inexpensive weddings lead to more satisfying and long-lasting marriages. Researchers also found there's another certain characteristic that increases the likelihood of divorce - importance of looks. For some, it's a deal-breaker. They found if one of the parties involved placed their partner's looks as being "important" in their decision to get married, that tended to lead to a shorter marriage. So, lesson learned here is don't go over-board when it comes to spending money on your wedding - and when looking for a potential spouse, it's what's on the inside that counts.

# View Nicholas Monica's Obituary on theblade.com and share memories

(News story) Nicholas Lawrence Papa Monica, a World War II veteran who served in both the Pacific and European theaters and who later ran a tomato distribution company before becoming an investigator in private and insurance matters, died Thursday at his home in Toledo. He was 99. His daughter, Tana Snyder, said he died of organ failure related to old age. He was born May 19, 1919, in Tiffin to Frank and Philomena Monaco. He later began going by the surname Monica because announcers often mispronounced his original name during a career in amateur boxing for some years after high school. He just kept it that way because that's how he was known, Mrs. Snyder said. He stopped boxing when the war broke out and joined the U.S. Army in 1942. Son Frank Monica said his father was a tank commander in the Philippines and later worked with heavy ordnance in Europe, driving and repairing tanks and maintaining heavy artillery. The younger Mr. Monica said his father invented a small breech-lock device for a howitzer cannon. He was just messing around in the ordnance department and figured out a way to prevent the recoil from hurting soldiers after they fired them, he said. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge, but did not talk to family about his service aside from sharing a few funny stories, his son said. Mr. Monica was honorably discharged in 1946 as a master sergeant. After the war, he worked as a tool and die maker with Doehler-Jarvis, Inc., and ran a small tomato distribution route on the side. That route grew into the Toledo Tomato Distributors, which he ran for about six years. The whole family worked in that field, Mrs. Snyder said. We used to distribute tomatoes to all the stores. He then helped the younger Mr. Monica at his business, Sunshine Market and Deli, for a time before becoming a private investigator and an insurance investigator from 1982 to 1992. He enjoyed it a lot, the younger Mr. Monica said. He just liked the adrenaline and staying active. Mrs. Snyder said her father's most cherished job was caring for the plants at Nick and Jimmy's restaurants, which he continued doing into his 90s. He was always a worker, she said. He never really stopped. Mr. Monica loved gardening, and was especially adept at growing tomatoes and green onions. His trick was to give the plants names and talk to them. They always seemed to respond to him, Mr. Monica said. He had plants named Elizabeth and Betty and Margaret. His lady plants always seemed to produce. Mr. Monica also loved cooking. His family came from Naples, and he often spent hours making homemade spaghetti sauce and meatballs following recipes handed down through the generations. After marrying Mary Besase in 1941, whose family came from Sicily, the household had many dinnertime wars over which style of Italian food to cook. Growing up, it was the battle between husband and wife to make the sauce this way or that way, Mrs. Snyder said. Some of [the dinners] were like the 'Sopranos.' Mr. Monica was also the family storyteller, telling tales from his childhood and his various experiences over the years, like that of his boxing match at Madison Square Garden. I can remember laying in bed with him telling stories every night, Mrs. Snyder said. He had so many stories, and he remembered everything. He loved talking to people, loved making them laugh. We laughed so much. He also enjoyed golfing and was an avid fan of the Ohio State University Buckeyes, never missing a game. Surviving are sons Nicholas Jr., Frank, and Mike Monica; daughter Tana Snyder; 10 grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. Visitation begins at 2 p.m. Wednesday at Newcomer Northwest chapel, 4150 W. Laskey Rd. in Toledo. A military presentation begins at 6 p.m. with a funeral service to follow. The family suggests tributes to Hospice of Northwest Ohio. This is a news story by Alexandra Mester. Contact her at amester@theblade.com or 419-724-6066.<|im_end|>

# Pro-Jeb Bush super PAC fined for accepting foreign donations

Pro-Jeb Bush super PAC fined for accepting foreign donations  WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Election Commission is fining a super PAC that supported former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush for accepting over $1.3 million in illegal donations from Chinese nationals.  The Right to Rise super political action committee was fined $390,000 for soliciting the foreign contributions during the 2016 campaign. American Pacific International Capital, a Chinese-owned company, was fined $550,000 for giving the donation.  The federal agency hasn't publicly announced the decision. But the Campaign Legal Center, which brought the FEC complaint, released agency documents announcing the fine on Monday.  A Right to Rise spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The group raised $121 million for Bush's failed presidential bid.  Bush is a former Florida governor, as well as the brother and son of former presidents.  FILE - In this April 25, 2018, file photo, former Florida Gov.

# Daytona Motor Mouths: Team colors would help NASCAR

This week’s episode of Daytona Motor Mouths features a true rant, plus a bonus round of bluster, from News-Journal sports columnist Ken Willis.  This week’s episode of Daytona Motor Mouths features a true rant, plus a bonus round of bluster, from News-Journal sports columnist Ken Willis. “I think race teams should have team colors,” Ken said. “You go back 20, 25 years and drivers were recognized by the colors on their cars.” Motorsports Editor Godwin Kelly admits at first he didn’t think car color mattered but Ken’s pervasive and persistent argument has swayed the veteran into his corner. “You’re right,” Godwin said. “Car colors make sense. It builds the ‘team’ concept.” Other topics of note include Kyle Busch’s landmark 200th NASCAR victory across three national series. He is only one behind Richard Petty’s all-time mark of 201. In addition to his 200 NASCAR Cup Series victories, Petty won one Convertible Series race in 1959. “It was a national series with good drivers,” Ken said. “Curtis Turner won a bunch of those races.” The guys agree NASCAR needs to take action when it comes to group qualifying. Godwin has the answer. “NASCAR says ‘when qualifying starts, you got one minute to get on the track or lose your chance,' " he said. “Problem solved.” Other topics of interest include Martinsville, the new batch of NASCAR Hall of Fame nominees and Danica Patrick’s return to racing as a commentator for the Indianapolis 500.<|im_end|>

# Great experience at restaurant

My wife and dined at the Himalaya Sherpa Kitchen, in November 2018, while on a road trip through the wine country. The restaurant came highly recommended, and we were not disappointed in any way. We had the opportunity to meet the owners and found them to be extremely personable, kind and generous. While I cannot address the charges brought by their former employee, it seems to have been settled. I would like everyone to support their local restaurants, especially those owned by this family.

# Magee sets record, Wofford tops Seton Hall for 1st NCAA win - ABC Columbia

Magee sets record, Wofford tops Seton Hall for 1st NCAA win  JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Fletcher Magee set the Division I career record for 3-pointers, poured in 24 points and led seventh-seeded Wofford to an 84-68 victory over Seton Hall in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday night.  Magee hit seven treys against the No. 10 seed Pirates to help the Terriers to their first tournament win in five tries. Wofford also won its 21st consecutive game overall.  Magee now has 509 3-pointers in four seasons, breaking the career mark set by Oakland’s Travis Bader in 2014. Duke’s J.J. Redick (457), Tennessee’s Chris Lofton (431) and Davidson’s Stephen Curry (414) also rank in the top 10.  Extending his record might not be easy against second-seeded Kentucky in the Midwest Region on Saturday. The long, lanky Wildcats tend to give opponents fits, especially from behind the arc.  Then again, Magee is no ordinary shooter.  The 6-foot-4 guard was 7 of 12 behind the arc, none bigger than his 3 from the corner in front of his bench in the second half. The first two were wide-open looks that caused Seton Hall coach Kevin Willard some angst, and the third a contested shot that brought the Wofford faithful to their feet and put the Terriers up 76-66 with three minutes to play.  It was quite a show about two hours north of Magee’s hometown of Orlando.  Nathan Hoover added 18 points for the Terriers (30-4), who finished 13 of 28 from 3-point range. Cameron Jackson chipped in 14 points, 10 rebounds and five assists.  Myles Powell led the Pirates (20-14) with 27 points on 10-of-25 shooting.  Powell helped Seton Hall overcome a 12-point deficit in the second half, and he even put his team ahead 54-53 with about 10 minutes to go. But it was all Wofford late, going on a 17-0 run in the closing minutes before Seton Hall managed a meaningless dunk at the end.  BIG PICTURE  Seton Hall got into the NCAA Tournament thanks to wins over Kentucky, defending national champ Villanova and Marquette (twice). The Pirates played well in all of those games, but they looked nothing like that against the Terriers. Three issues doomed them: lousy 3-point shooting (9 of 27), free-throw shooting (9 of 15) and turnovers (13).  Wofford, with an enrollment of 1,650, keeps making history. The Terriers became the smallest school to be ranked in the Top 25 since VMI in 1977, and now have their first tournament victory.  UP NEXT  Seton Hall waits to see whether Powell enters the NBA Draft. The junior guard averaged 23 points this season, ranking 10th in the nation, and was voted first-team All-Big East.  Wofford gets the mighty Wildcats on Saturday. Kentucky will likely be without leading scorer and rebounder PJ Washington, who sat out his team’s win over Abilene Christian with an injury.<|im_end|>

# Making ends meet: artist Mr Bingo

Mr Bingo’s amassed the sort of fandom a lot of artists envy; his fans seem willing to part with their pennies not just to buy his illustrations, but to ‘buy’ his phone number too, to take a train ride with him and, most bizarrely, for the ashes from his fireplace (really). From his early days as an illustrator for hire, Bingo now earns a living from the outsized persona he has created.  If you hang around London’s Shoreditch long enough, you’ll see Mr Bingo walking around in bubble-gum pink or neon green shorts. He stands out even among East London’s eclectic mix of characters, not for the shorts, which actually aren’t that outlandish in those parts, but because he’s the sort of chap people stop in the street to get selfies with. There’s even an Instagram account called @watchingmrbingo which collects crowdsourced images of Mr Bingo spotted in the wild.  He’s amassed fans all over the world, has a large social media following (over 100k between Instagram and Twitter) and has inspired a wealth of fan art. His claim to all this fame? He makes drawings. They’re sometimes rude, sometimes weird, mostly hilarious. While the drawings themselves win him a lot of love – fans even tattoo his art on themselves – what seems to resonate with people beyond the art is the man himself – or at least the version he presents to the public. Being Mr Bingo has become his full-time occupation.  And people can’t get enough of it. Bingo once famously crowdsourced £135,000 via a video of him rapping in amusingly awkward, ironic style. The money raised went toward publishing his Hate Mail project in book form. With Hate Mail, Bingo had offered to send postcards featuring lovingly-crafted, bespoke and spectacularly filthy illustrated insults to a recipient of the purchaser’s choice. It was hugely popular.  Much before the rapping, Mr Bingo worked as a commercial illustrator, doing commissions for brands and businesses. After 15 years of being a gun for hire, he decided to give it all up and work exclusively on self-initiated projects. He makes and sells art via his online shop, doing everything from coming up with the ideas to popping prints in the post all by himself. We talk to him about how it all works.  Creative Review: What sort of financial plans did you have in place when you stopped taking on commercial projects and decided to focus solely on self-initiated work? 
Mr Bingo: I made sure I had enough money set aside to live on for a year. That money has always stayed there, and I never touch it. It makes me feel (mentally) safe and that I don’t need to worry about where next month’s rent is coming from. The bigger your buffer money is, the more free you can be. I guess the idea is to have enough set aside so that you never have to take a job you won’t enjoy again just because you need some quick cash. I worked as a commercial illustrator for about 15 years and slowly and steadily gained ‘fans’ over that time period until I decided to quit my commercial illustration career in 2015 and go it alone as a 100% self-sufficient artist. I made a decision to never work for clients again and I was very serious about it. Join our community  This article is available only to subscribers. You can join here.

# Wishbone Ash: Reissues

Their music might lack the personality of their hard rock peers, but no one can fault the Ash for their staying power. They released their 24th studio album, Blue Horizon, this year, and these reissues – spanning the decade between 1996’s Illuminations and 2007’s Power Of Eternity – provide further reminders of Andy Powell’s ear for a pop hook. Even now, Illuminations (7⁄10) has the feel of classic Ash, a crisp production ensuring that even 10-minute wig-out Tales Of The Wise doesn’t overstay its welcome. Where the largely acoustic Bare Bones (6⁄10) has the feel of a stop-gap, 2002’s Bona Fide (7⁄10) fizzes with energy, Powell indulging in bluesy lead face-offs with Finnish axe-hero-for-hire Ben Granfelt. Power Of Eternity (8⁄10) is the best of the bunch. All the familiar Ash trademarks (tungsten-strength melodies; spaghetti-length solos) are present and correct. Funky curve balls (Driving A Wedge) and searing mid-life analysis (Growing Up) are all delivered with a conviction that they’re on the right path, a feeling vindicated by the fact that this revised line-up – including Muddy Manninen and Joe Crabtree – remains to this day. With more than eight hours of music to trawl through, plus new interviews with Powell about each album, these thoughtfully presented packages define how all reissues should be done.<|im_end|>

# Tuned BMW M5 Drag Races Lamborghini Huracan, The Fight Is Brutal

We've talked about the drag racing potential of the F90 BMW M5 on multiple occasions. However, no Internet detail can prepare the owner of a supercar for an encounter with the Bavarian four-door. And the latest adventure of the sort involves the super-sedan battling a Lamborghini Huracan. Now, while the current M5 is uber-quick, it still can't leave the V10 Raging Bull behind, at least not in factory form. However, the BMW that brought us here has left its stock configuration behind. 
 To be more precise, the twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 heart of this Bimmer has been gifted with a full custom exhaust, air intake, ECU remap and a meth injection system. 
 Keep in mind that the F90 incarnation of the M car is the first to pack all-paw hardware, which means the put-the-power-down issues of the previous F10 M5 have been left behind. 
 As for the Sant'Agata Bolognese toy sitting before us, this doesn't feature any modification. Note that we're talking about the pre-revamp (read: Evo) Huracan, coming in the standard LP610-4 form, if we may use this term. 
 Then again, we'll remind you that the current Lamborghini quarter-mile world record has been set by this model and its sits at 10.47 seconds. So while the 640 Performante failed to beat this record, we can say the same about the 770 horsepower Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, at least so far. 
 The Huracan and the M5 fortunately got together at the drag strip, which meant these all-wheel-drive monster could make full use of the prepped surface. And, despite the presence of the Christmas Tree, getting an even start didn't exactly come easy, as you'll notice in the piece of footage below. 
 Of course, M5 tuning efforts go even further than this. For instance, a Russian afteramrket developer claims to have taken an example of the super-sedan into the 9s arena.

# DFW Cities Host Area's Largest-Ever Severe Weather Exercise

The start of spring also marks the beginning of severe weather season in Texas. To make sure they're prepared for whatever Mother Nature throws their way, cities across the Metroplex took part in the region's largest-ever severe weather exercise Thursday. "Failing to plan is planning to fail," said Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, who is responsible for the county's emergency preparedness. "We do these practices so that we're ready for the real thing." The exercise brought together leaders, emergency responders, and representatives from mutiple local, state, and federal agencies -- as well as medical professionals and disaster relief organizations. They were presented with a scenario where a powerful EF4 tornado ripped through the heart of Downtown Dallas, leaving nearly a dozen people dead, hundreds of people injured, and still more people trapped and stranded within the area. "When you have something of this nature occur, it's very difficult to say that you're going to have enough people [to respond]," said Dallas County Sheriff Marian Brown, who also participated in the exercise. "We can always use more resources. And so that's what's going to be the challenge for us in a setting like this." Although tornadoes more frequently strike the rural areas around DFW, Jenkins said the exercise scenario was not unrealistic -- pointing to both the tornado that hit Downtown Fort Worth back in 2000, as well as the more recent EF4 tornado in 2015 that leveled homes in the Garland/Rowlett area and killed several people. He and others also pointed out that the growth in North Texas continues to push out into those rural areas -- and the region is getting more densely populated each year. "Our urban footprint just keeps expanding," said Tom Bradshaw, Meterologist-in-Charge of the National Weather Service office in Dallas/Fort Worth. "There is a lot of real estate that weather can potentially impact from year to year." Brown noted that exercises like Thursday's force them to "think outside the box" so they're not caught off guard by any situation and have a plan in place to effectively respond to disasters. Officials in Tarrant and Denton counties also took part in the exercise.<|im_end|>

# Furious builder chases thieves who vanish into darkness

A builder who caught thieves stealing tools from his van chased them off, says he couldn't catch them because the street lights were switched off.  Dave Mitchell, 38, was woken by the sound of a car starting outside his home in Stephenson Way, Bourne, at 12.30am on March 21.  He went to check his home CCTV which had recorded a man in a hoodie taking tools out of his van.  Mr Mitchell said: "I was furious when I saw them on the CCTV and immediately jumped into my car and went to chase after them.  "The thieves had the audacity to shut the door on my van so it looked like nothing had happened."  M Mitchell added: "I didn't get very far as they disappeared in a matter of seconds with the street lights being turned off, something needs to change.  "When I got back in the house and calmed down, I was gutted.  "Someone needs to catch these people, these type of thefts are becoming more and more regular.  "I've got to earn a living and it's a massive inconvenience, although I've got insurance that's not the point.  "I now have to go and source new work tools, I'm trying to earn a living and now it's likely that my insurance premiums will go up next year."  Lincolnshire County Council switched off more than 68,000 street lights in 2016 in a bid to save £1.7m from the local authorities coffers.  The move has since been widely criticised from crime victims who have seen their streets plunged into darkness. However Lincolnshire Police have previously stated that it has found no noticeable increase in crime rates due to the lights being switched off.  And the county council announced in September last year that it was willing to turn streetlights back on again if individual communities were able to pay for it.

# Jet Airways crisis: How did the debt-laden airline secure ECB for working capital purposes? - Firstpost

Jet Airways, which has not kept its tryst with Indian banks and its employees, has also not kept its tryst with foreign lenders either under the External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) scheme insofar as part repayment that fell due on 11 March, 2019 is concerned.  The default to foreign lenders came to light thanks to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) disclosure requirement to it which is meant for public consumption more particularly investors to enable them to safeguard their investments.  The disclosure is cryptic and hence one does not know the extent of default but one can hazard a guess —Naresh Goyal, its chairman, was reportedly making frantic request to its 24 percent equity partner Etihad to pump in Rs 750 crore immediately.  One can surmise that the ECB dues were around this figure even though the dues it has to clear including to the Indian banks before 31 March, 2019 is Rs 1,700 crore.  The reason why Goyal was requesting feverishly is not far to seek — foreign lenders do not indulge the defaulters like the Indian financial system does.  Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) are reportedly reconciled to the idea of converting a substantial part of the loan outstandings into equity. Foreign lenders would do no such thing. Instead, they would slap a penalty.  Till recently, the ECB was not allowed for meeting working capital requirements. Yet curiously Jet Airways says the default it has committed on meeting its tryst with the ECB was precisely working capital related.  It is only in the new ECB policy notified in January 2019 that the bar on raising the ECB for working capital purposes was removed provided such working capital assistance was provided by a foreign equity holder holding not less than 25 percent equity in the assisted company i.e., Jet Airways in this instance.  Etihad in any case holds only 24 percent in Jet Airways. But the ECB on which Jet Airways has defaulted was under a much older regime when there was a general clampdown on the ECB being taken for working capital purposes. Therefore, the only possible inference is Jet Airways must have taken a special approval for allowing it to access the ECB for working capital purposes. Why was this special relaxation made by the powers that be in favor of Jet Airways? The ECB was encouraged for import of capital goods mainly.  The ECB has several attractions the chief among them being lower rate of interest in the European and US markets vis-à-vis the one prevailing in India. But the flip side is the exchange rate risk — if the exchange rate was Rs 50 per dollar when the ECB was raised but on the date of payment of interest or principal, the exchange rate has deteriorated to Rs 75, the entire advantage is neutralised in one stroke unless this risk was covered at a reasonable cost.     Unhedged exchange rate risk can wreck havoc on the financials of a borrower. In the above example, if the loan is to be repaid by buying the greenback at Rs 75 per dollar, the repayment would be one and half times the borrowings thus wiping out the interest rate advantage. One does not know if Jet Airways runs this risk as well. After the conversion of debt into equity, the Indian banks would reportedly for the time being overtake Etihad in terms of equity stakes in Jet Airways — 29 percent or so as against 24 percent by Etihad. But that is a cold comfort as the shares of Jet Airways are steadily going downhill.  In any case Indian banks do not have the expertise to manage and lift a sinking airline. Interestingly, it also raises questions over the much-vaunted financial skills of foreign lenders and investors vis-à-vis the Indians.   This is not the first time foreign lenders have tasted default by an Indian borrower. It happened with Essar a decade ago. It seems that they are unable to resist the temptation of earning more by way of interest from the Indian borrowers vis-à-vis the interest they can earn from the domestic borrowers. The ECB then is win-win for both the lender and the borrower. The borrower pays a lower interest and the lender gets a higher interest vis-à-vis the domestic borrowers. The borrower rues when the exchange rate turns adverse and the lender rues when the borrower defaults.

# Neil Lennon urges Celtic to use pain of Rangers defeat to inspire derby glory

Neil Lennon believes the hurt of Celtic ’s Ibrox flop can inspire his team to glory next week.  The Parkhead manager has already begun preparations for the clash with Rangers on Sunday week and the opportunity for his troops to extend their lead at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership table to 13 points.  Celtic lost their 13-match unbeaten record in the reverse fixture last December when a poor performance led to a meek 1-0 defeat from Steven Gerrard's men.  Lennon was at still in charge of Hibs on that day when Celtic were sunk in Govan almost three months ago, but feels the anguish of the setback may act as a hugely-positive motivation when the teams renew their rivalry at Parkhead.  He said: “These players continually get asked questions and they keep answering them.  “They will want to prove something to themselves as a group and individually as well.  “They have got to look at that feeling after the Ibrox game.  "That was their first defeat in 13 derbies. It was an incredible run.  “Maybe in a good way, to feel that hurt in defeat can really incentivise them for the game on the 31st.  “And there is an opportunity to go 13 points clear.”  Lennon, though, is adamant no-one within the camp will be making any big statements of intent either before the Rangers game or at any time between now and the end of the campaign.  The boss is determined for the troops to do their talking on the park and keep delivering as they did over two-and-a-half years under ex-boss Brendan Rodgers.  Lennon told Celtic TV: “We are just keeping calm. My backroom team John [Kennedy], Damien [Duff], all the staff, no soundbytes. Nothing controversial.  “Just keep things going as they were under Brendan and it’s working in our favour.  “We just stay focused, don’t get carried away with the hype surrounding the game coming up and just go out there and do what they are good at.”<|im_end|>

# Philippines' Duterte says close ties with China will remain despite ICC complaint

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines’ President Rodrigo Duterte said Manila’s relations with Beijing will not be jeopardised despite two former officials filing a complaint with the International Criminal Court over China’s aggression in the disputed South China Sea. Since taking office in 2016, the Philippine leader re-oriented his foreign policy away from longtime ally the United States and toward China, despite decades of mistrust and bitter maritime disputes with Beijing. However, the country’s former anti-graft chief and former foreign affairs minister is asking the ICC to conduct a preliminary examination on China’s role in the South China Sea. The letter was dated March 13 - four days before the Philippines’ unilateral withdrawal from the ICC was formalized. Duterte said: “They think they have a good case and I would say that there is no jurisdiction over this country and of China.” Close ties will remain as China understands that anyone can file a case as the Philippines is a democratic country, he told reporters late on Thursday. Duterte is facing criticism from opponents for making too many political concessions to China in return for billions of dollars of pledged Chinese loans and investment, most of which have yet to materialize. China says it has irrefutable sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and the waters around them. Under the ICC rules, any individual, group or state can communicate with the prosecutor on alleged crimes falling under the court’s jurisdiction. The complaints can form the initial basis of the preliminary examinations. Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Alison Williams<|im_end|>

# The truth about Diet Coke: is the fizzy drink harming your health?

Look around any office, gym, or public park, and you’re likely to find at least one of them: a Diet Coke fanatic, who can merrily swig their way through six or seven cans each day.  Fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died last month, was one such addict, telling a magazine in 2012 that he consumed 10 cans of the sweet stuff every day. Lord Falconer, the Labour Peer, said last year that his weight loss regime of Diet Coke and apples – which shed him five stone – hooked him to the caffeinated drink, consuming up to 15 cans each day.  This week, a study by the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health found that two fizzy drinks a day could boost your risk of death from heart disease by almost a third,...

# Alessandra Ambrosio & Gisele Coria Rock Matching Tiny Bikinis For Swimwear Shoot

Former Victoria’s Secret angel Alessandra Ambrosio is matching swimwear with fellow model and friend Gisele Coria. The twosome both sported a seriously skimpy bikini look from their new swimwear brand Gal Floripa – which the duo recently launched alongside Alessandra’s sister Aline Ambrosio – as they posed for the camera for a new swimwear shoot.  The new snap was uploaded to Gal Floripa’s official Instagram account on March 21 and showed the stunning duo posing back to back as they proudly flaunted their toned bodies in their string two pieces.  Alessandra opted for the darker brown version of the string swimwear piece as she posed for the camera with her bestie, while Gisele sported the red version of the skimpy bikini number.  Both stars kept their long hair down and held hands as they stared at the camera in front of the ocean while shooting poses for the camera in front of the ocean.  The swimwear’s official account shared the stunning new beach photo alongside a message written in both English and Portuguese as a nod to both Alessandra and Gisele’s native country of Brazil.  “Sun in Aries,” Gal of Floripa wrote with a fire emoji. “Tag your favorite Aries Gal and empower her best qualities of #courage and #authenticity #GalacticGAL.”  Coria then posted the same bikini photo to her own Instagram account where she added the hashtag #GalacticSunCollection.  Ambrosio recently opened up about starting the swimwear brand, sharing that the idea had been a longtime dream for herself, Gisele, and Aline for several years when they were growing up together in the South American country.  “We always had this dream. We grew up in Florianopolis, which is an island south of Brazil, and swim was always like our second skin,” the Victoria’s Secret superstar told People of the inspiration behind the line.  “We were always in a swimsuit going from one beach to another and always wanted to have a bikini shop there one day. That was our dream when we were 18,” Alessandra added.  She also revealed that the name of the brand was formed by pushing together parts of all three of their names.  Ambrosio’s been showing off a number of different pieces from the line on her social media over the past few weeks.  The Inquisitr recently shared photos of the model giving fans just a little tease of her tiny red bikini in another sultry snap posted online this week.  Prior to that, The Inquisitr revealed even more snaps of the stunning mom of two flaunting her toned body in a metallic swimsuit in another photo taken from her recent Gal Floripa swimsuit shoot at the beach.<|im_end|>

# Bivol Dominates Smith; Defends WBA Light Heavyweight Title for Fifth Time

Undefeated Dmitry Bivol successfully defended his WBA light heavyweight world title for the fifth time with a dominating twelfth round unanimous decision over Joe “The Common Man” Smith Jr., in which he won almost every single round on all three judges’ scorecards (118-110, 119-109, and 119-109). 
 This fight card was promoted by Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Boxing and was televised by DAZN from Turning Stone Resort Casino in Verona, New York.  Bivol controlled this one-sided fight with his vastly superior and more technical boxing skills. He displayed an excellent jab and counter punching and landed the more effective combinations that kept Smith off balance and prevented him from getting into any kind of offensive rhythm. Every round, Smith loaded up on his punches as he desperately tried to land the knockout punch that never happened.  Bivol outworked and out-landed Smith for the first three rounds. Smith had one of his better rounds of the fight in fourth when he connected on a hard right hook that momentarily stunned Bivol. Bivol landed several hard shots in the fifth round and connected on a powerful right uppercut that stunned Smith in the sixth. 
 He landed a short left hook that staggered Smith in the seventh round and then in the eighth, he connected on back-to-back left hooks that appeared to really hurt Smith. Bivol continued to punish Smith in the ninth, but right before the end of the tenth, Smith landed his best punch of the fight with a powerful overhand right to Bivol’s temple that caused him to stagger back to his corner.  Smith came out in the eleventh with a renewed sense of urgency and aggression as he desperately tried to knockout Bivol. He controlled the round as Bivol was content to take it off to recover from the previous round. Both fighters traded big shots in the twelfth, but Bivol closed the fight with numerous, unanswered hard shots on Smith who somehow did not go down.  Bivol dominated the CompuBox punch statistics as he landed more punches than Smith (208 to 39), threw more (714 to 395), and had a better connect percentage (29 to 10). He also landed more jabs (101 to 18) and power punches (107 to 21). Smith landed a paltry 3.5 punches per round.  Bivol improved to 16-0, 11 KOs. He was extended the full twelve rounds for the third consecutive time. 
His promoter, Hearn stated after the fight that he will make his mandatory defense against undefeated Marcus Browne (23-0, 16 KOs) in August. Browne recently defeated light heavyweight world title challenger, Badou Jack in January.  Smith demonstrated a great deal of heart by not going down despite taking a tremendous amount of punishment throughout this fight. He dropped to 24-3, 20 KOs and lost for the second time in his last three fights. Smith was taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure after the fight but appeared to be fine.  In the co-feature, unbeaten WBO super lightweight titleholder, Maurice “Mighty Mo” Hooker scored an assertive, one-sided twelfth round unanimous decision over Mikkel “Slikk Mikk” LesPierre via three scorecards (120-107, 119-108, and 118-109).  Hooker dominated this fight. He was the faster and more powerful puncher and outworked and out-landed LesPierre, who did not throw a lot of punches in the first half of the bout. Hooker knocked down LesPierre midway through the fifth round, however, referee, Benjy Esteves Jr. ruled it was a slip.  LesPierre fought much better in the second half of the bout as he finally let his hands go. He fought a competitive sixth and seventh round and might have won the eighth. Hooker scored a knockdown in the ninth via a powerful left hook to the body. LesPierre barely beat the ten-count and somehow survived the round. Hooker punished LesPierre for the next three rounds and staggered him on several occasions, yet LesPierre hung in there and made it to the final bell.  According to CompuBox punch statistics, Hooker landed more punches than LesPierre (240 to 103), threw more (928 to 488), and had a better connect percentage (26 to 21). Hooker also landed more jabs (51 to 14) and power punches (189 to 89).  Hooker upped his record to 26-0-3, 17 KOs. He successfully defended his WBO belt for the second time since he defeated Terry Flanagan last year via a split decision. LesPierre suffered his professional loss as he fell to 21-1-1, 9 KOs.  After the bout, Hooker stated that despite taking the full two hours and four attempts to make weight (140-pounds), he will still box in the super lightweight division. His promoter, Hearn announced that his next bout will take place in his hometown of Dallas, Texas. If Hooker had his way, it would be a unification bout against any one of the other world champions: Jose Ramirez (WBC), Kiryl Relikh (WBA), or Ivan Baranchyk (IBF).<|im_end|>

# May's latest Brexit deal "meaningless"

“It doesn’t change the substantive problem with the Withdrawal Agreement,” says Robert Oulds, director of the Thatcherite think-tank Bruges Group.  “It doesn’t mean that we are not going to be paying the European Union 39 billion pounds, perhaps even more.  “It doesn’t actually stop the problem of the European Court of Justice continuing to have a say in affairs within the UK, even when we are technically outside the EU,” he says.  Referring to May’s new agreements, Oulds says they are mere “meaningless pieces of paper. It doesn’t actually change a very, very bad deal, which has been overwhelmingly rejected by the British House of Commons.”  Expecting the vote on Tuesday 12 March to reject May’s adjusted Withdrawal Deal, he doesn’t see postponing the Brexit deadline beyond 29 March as a viable option. Robert Oulds is not scared of the chaos that some observers predict will erupt at airports and harbours serving Europe.  “Actually we know exactly what will happen when we leave the EU which is still set for 29 March, because in case the Withdrawal Agreement isn’t passed, the EU is offering other deals.  “It is offering unlimited access in terms of haulage, it is saying the flights will continue, it has signed up to the Transport Convention. The ports of Calais and Boulogne are ready for the withdrawal agreement to be voted out."  Meanwhile, European Council President Jean-Claude Juncker said in a joint press conference with Theresa May on Monday that if the latest adjustments are not accepted by the UK House of Commons, there may be “no Brexit at all”.  According to Robert Oulds, “the fact remains that we have legislation in the UK in force to leave the EU on 29 March. Brexit is happening. And even the EU wants it to happen, because they know that if we are in the EU beyond the 23 May, we have to partake in the European elections. They do not want Britain in the EU returning Eurosceptics to the European Parliament.”<|im_end|>

# France's EDF in race to convert Cordemais plant from coal to biomass

CORDEMAIS, France (Reuters) - French utility EDF aims to convert its 1,200-megawatt (MW) Cordemais coal-fired power plant by spring 2022 into one that burns pellet fuel made from discarded wood, giving the unit a new lease of life. If successful, the process - known as Ecocombust - could be exported and adapted to other coal plants, saving jobs, while Cordemais would boost France’s security of supply in winter. But EDF must convince the government by autumn that the project is financially and environmentally viable. French grid operator RTE is also expected to determine by April whether the plant is surplus to requirements. In its long-term energy plan, France has laid out moves to phase out electricity generation from coal by 2022, with the goal of decarbonizing energy production by 2050. The decision sounded the death knell for the five remaining coal-fired generators in France, with an installed capacity of around 3,000 MW. Three of the generators - Cordemais 4 and 5, and Havre 4 - are operated by state-controlled EDF. Cordemais in western France was overhauled two years ago to meet new emissions and safety standards at a cost of several million euros, and could keep operating until 2035, EDF says. France’s two other coal generators, Emile Huchet 6 and Provence 5, with a combined installed capacity of 1,200 MW, are operated by German utility Uniper. EDF executives said the Ecocombust project, already in an advanced test phase, would burn pellets made from discarded “class B” wood and garden waste, for large-scale power generation. The project is the first of its kind, they say. Although pellets from wood chips and sawdust are widely used for heating, Eric Bret, EDF’s head of thermal power generation, said the process was different because the company would not cut down any trees. “The pellets are made from ... everyday objects such as beams, doors, window frames and furniture, which until now are mostly recycled or buried in landfill,” he said. Lionel Olivier, director of the Cordemais and Havre power plants, said the pellets would be 70 percent “class B” wood and 30 percent residue from grass, tree branches and garden waste, all sourced within a radius of 150 km (93 miles). He said EDF was setting up a supply chain that included municipal waste authorities and companies, but would need state aid. EDF declined to say what the conversion would cost and how much it had invested in the process. At capacity, it aims to replace around 1.3 million to 2 million tonnes of coal imported annually from Poland, Australia and the United States, with about 700,000 tonnes of biomass. Tests carried out in August with 80 percent pellet fuel and 20 percent coal to generate electricity for over four hours were successful, Olivier said. The pellets have 20 percent less energy or caloric value than coal, which could reduce each generator’s output capacity to 530 MW from 600 MW currently, he added. Cordemais’ production would focus on periods of peak power demand in winter. After the conversion, output would be reduced to 800 hours annually from 4,000 hours, he said. “Runtime would be five times less than the current production using coal but it will focus on a period when power prices are higher and more profitable,” Olivier said. He added that the plant would also use five times less coal and emit five times less carbon dioxide. Reporting by Bate Felix; Editing by Dale Hudson<|im_end|>

# Gardiner, Dermott skate before practice - TSN.ca

Colaiacovo: 'Leafs need more from their bottom pair defencemen' Injured defencemen Jake Gardiner and Travis Dermott took another step forward in their recovery.  Both injured blueliners went through skating drills together before the club's practice on Friday morning.  "First time at least that I have seen him skating since the Leafs announced he was out with a back injury on Feb. 27," tweeted TSN's Kristen Shilton.  Gardiner was originally listed as being out week-to-week. The 28-year-old has two goals and is a plus-17 in 60 games this year.  Dermott, who is battling a shoulder injury, has been skating on his own for over a week. He last played in an NHL game on Feb. 27 where he was a plus-1 in 17:05 of ice time.  He has four goals and 13 assists in 60 games so far this season.  The Leafs will be back in action Saturday night as they host the New York Rangers.<|im_end|>

# Downtown tourist funding receives $5 M from Ontario government

The Ontario government has provided $5 million in funding to support a new Paper Mill district tourism attraction in Sault Ste. Marie.  The Ontario government is earmarking $5 million toward creating a downtown tourist area in Sault Ste. Marie. The money, from the Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines, will be used to build new tourism features at the former St. Marys Paper site, announced Sault MPP Ross Romano. The project includes a new Agawa Canyon Tour Train station, an exhibit centre-gallery, a micro-brewery and an outdoor event centre. The attractions are designed to complement The Machine Shop, an adjacent building that includes a restaurant, pub and event facility. The money will be combined with private sector real estate and manufacturing partner. It’s expected that eight new full and part time jobs will be created. “Tourism is vital to the economy of many Northern communities like Sault Ste. Marie,” Romano said. The paper mill district project will create a significant investment into a unique tourism market. EDC executive director Dan Hollingsworth said the EDC will partner with the SIS Group, the property’s owners, on the project. “As a proud lifelong resident and an entrepreneur in Sault Ste. Marie, I am pleased to help grow the tourism sector and provide opportunities here in the community,” said Tony Porco, owner of the SIS Group. Last May, city council lifted a holding provision on the property to allow the development of a train station to proceed.  At that time, not much information was provided on the developer’s plans but were told that confidential negotiations between the owner of the property and railway are ongoing. The public did learn that the plan calls for the new train station, loading platform and parking as well as the redevelopment of the yard locker building on the former paper mill property. Plans unveiled at that time suggested the development would also incorporate the Group of Seven boxcar and other train artifacts. The idea of moving the Agawa Canyon Train Station to the property was first introduced in 2014 under the Destination North concept that focused on woods and water, First Nations and the area’s culture.<|im_end|>

# Two people killed in head-on crash in Parlier

FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- The California Highway Patrol is investigating a deadly two-car crash that left two people dead in Parlier.      It happened at 8:30 p.m. Monday on Mendocino Avenue just south of Manning Avenue.        According to officers, a man driving north in a pick-up truck crossed the road's double-yellow lines for an unknown reason, crashing head-on with a woman in a van.      Both drivers died at the scene. They were the only occupants in their vehicles.      Officers have the roads closed off as they investigate the crash.        CHP says it is unclear if drugs or alcohol were a factor in the crash.      This is a developing breaking news story. Stay with us for updates.

# Browns re-sign DT Carl Davis

One new player and two players re-signed is what the doctor has ordered for the Cleveland Browns on day two of free agency. Earlier today, it was reported that the Browns were signing defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson and later this afternoon former Ravens 2015 first round pick Breshad Perriman was put back on the payroll.  The latest Browns move consists of a signing involves a twist of the previous two. Defensive tackle Carl Davis, a former 2015 third-round pick of the Ravens, re-signed in Cleveland according to a team announcement.  Davis only played 31 defensive snaps for the Browns last season in five games. He is seen as a depth piece to a defensive line needing just that.<|im_end|>

# Flu deaths double in Ventura County but remain far below last year

Generally, the flu symptoms are more severe than the cold symptoms, but how do you know which virus you might have? We break down the differences. Wochit Flu deaths in Ventura County doubled in the past month in a rise a public health official said is not unusual but is evidence of a still-lingering season marked by two different strains of the flu. As of Tuesday, 10 people in the county had suffered flu-linked deaths during the current flu season, including four people younger than 65, said Ventura County Public Health Officer Dr. Robert Levin. Since Feb. 12, five people had died. Neither the rise nor the total in flu deaths is out of the ordinary, Levin said. The season has been much less severe than last year’s record flu season in which 49 local fatalities were linked to flu. But while the severity of the flu has lessened this year, its reluctance to exit is similar to last year, when illnesses continued to emerge into April. LEARN MORE: How does the flu kill you? What you should know And while the dominant flu strain at the beginning of the current flu season was H1N1, a second strain — H3N2 — has emerged recently. This year’s vaccine covers both strains. Levin urged people who have not been immunized to get vaccinated. And while at least one Vons pharmacy, on Victoria Avenue in Oxnard, said it had no flu vaccine Tuesday, other stores and clinics, including two public health sites, still have doses. Elsewhere in Ventura County, the flu received varied prognoses. Doctors at Adventist Health Simi Valley and Community Memorial Hospital said numbers appeared to be down. But a pediatrician in Thousand Oaks and an urgent care doctor in Oxnard said they’re still seeing the flu. The most recent report from the California Department of Public Health said flu activity was elevated in every county, including Ventura County. On Tuesday, Levin agreed with the assessment but said he heard reports that indicate the season could be starting to diminish locally. The first Ventura County death this flu season happened in October, with the most recent death coming in early March. Several, but not all, of the deaths have involved people with pre-existing health conditions, Levin said. Across California, flu had factored into 307 deaths this flu season as of March 2, according to the California Department of Public Health. Five of the deaths statewide involved youths. Levin declined to reveal whether any of the childhood deaths occurred in Ventura County. The other infectious disease making news Tuesday was measles. Los Angeles County public health officials warned of a possible exposure related to a Los Angeles International Airport traveler diagnosed with the disease. They said people at risk of exposure include those who were at the Tom Bradley International Terminal B or at Delta Airlines in LAX’s Terminal 3 between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Thursday. “If you think that you or someone you know has been exposed to or has measles, contact your health care provider by phone right away before going in,” said Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County health officer. Levin said no cases of measles have been reported in Ventura County.<|im_end|>

# Kodi CRACKDOWN: Add-on blow as MAJOR copyright law changes move step closer

Kodi addon users have received some big piracy news as the copyright crackdown continues. Research has suggested Kodi - which offers access to thousands of channels - is being used in more than five million UK homes. Kodi software is not illegal, but unaffiliated developers can produce third-party add-ons that provide free access to pirated and illegal content. These illegal add-ons have been targeted by ISPs, government agencies, broadcasters and rights holders. And as the ongoing piracy crackdown rages on Kodi add-on fans have been dealt some big news. Major copyright law changes have moved a step closer after European lawmakers agreed the final text of the EU Copyright Directive. This includes the controversial Article 13 and Article 11, which could lead to ‘upload filters’ and a ‘link tax’. Article 11 would enable publishers to charge fees to platforms like Google or Facebook when they show snippets of their articles. While Article 13 puts the onus on websites to ensure content their users upload does not breach copyright. These sites would be liable for content that breaches copyright unless “effective and proportionate” measures are enforced. In a document online the European Parliament said these measures would include the use of “effective content recognition technologies”. So, in essence - video sharing platforms need to ensure what gets uploaded to their sites is not in breach of copyright. And if it does, it opens the door for rights holders to demand compensation. It’s led to fears that Article 13, if passed, could see websites adopting ‘upload filters’ to ensure whatever is uploaded does not breach copyright. If that’s the case, it would have a huge impact on illegal Kodi add-ons. These Kodi add-ons - which are made by third party developers - find and pull together pirated streams of movies and TV shows posted on the internet. If Article 13 is enforced then that would likely significantly reduce the number of streams these add-ons can turn to. The final vote on whether to adopt this proposed copyright law change is two weeks away, but calls are gathering for it to be enforced quickly. A coalition of 243 organisations representing rights holders are calling on the European Parliament to adopt the plans, TorrentFreak reported. A joint letter released this week said: “We, the undersigned organisations, representing authors, composers, writers, journalists, performers and others working in all artistic fields, news agencies, book, press, scientific and music publishers, audiovisual and independent music producers call on the European Parliament to adopt the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market.” PRS for Music, Eurocinema and the Association of Independent Music are among the signatories for the letter. It adds: “This Directive has been long sought to create a much-needed level playing field for all actors of the creative sector in the European Digital Single Market, whilst giving citizens better access to a wider array of content. “This is an historic opportunity. We need an internet that is fair and sustainable for all. This is why we urge policymakers to adopt the Directive quickly, as agreed in trilogue negotiations.” The final vote on the EU copyright directive will take place at the end of this month. • Stay tuned to Express.co.uk for more Kodi and copyright news<|im_end|>

# DEAR ABBY: Crime shows influence parents' paranoia about the real world

DEAR ABBY: I dwell in a small, Southern and, I thought, safe hometown. I'm currently unemployed and therefore unable to afford a place of my own. I live with my parents. I have job-searched for months now for something within walking distance. I pay for food with food stamps. But I can't yet pay for transportation, insurance, necessities, etc. My problem is, I love to walk four to six times a week for 30 minutes to an hour. It helps me with depression and boosts my self-esteem, health and wellness. It shouldn't be a problem, right? Well, I've been warned several times that I could get hit by a vehicle, kidnapped and even murdered if I continue to do it. (My parents are TV crime show fans.) Abby, I have spoken with the police in my area. They assure me it's safe to be out for a walk. Yet, if I'm gone more than 15 or 20 minutes, I receive incessant, ominous, foreboding warning calls on my cellphone. What can I do about their overactive spookiness? I can't afford a treadmill. — STEPPING OUT IN ARKANSAS DEAR STEPPING: When you leave for your walk, tell your parents approximately what time they can expect you back, leaving yourself a few minutes' leeway. Then silence your cellphone and enjoy your walk. DEAR ABBY: Is it wrong to question some belief or fact that someone else has brought up? I'm not in the habit of picking fights or bringing up controversial topics in social situations. But if someone else brings it up first or makes a verifiable claim, I think I'm within my rights to ask for a source or to argue the point if I disagree. I am being told that doing this is rude. I always thought that if someone makes a claim or statement, then it's acceptable for the people you are talking with to ask where the information came from or to disagree. And if someone doesn't want to risk their opinion being challenged, or isn't absolutely sure the claim can withstand scrutiny, they should keep their mouth shut. IS it rude to ask, "Oh, what's your source for that?" or say, "The studies I've read say that ..."? — FRIENDLY DISCUSSION DEAR FRIENDLY: I think it depends upon the subject being discussed and the tone in which the question is asked. Sometimes it ain't what you say as much as the way it comes across that makes others defensive. DEAR ABBY: At the checkout counter I noticed the clerk had a tattoo in the cleavage of her breasts. I could see it because of her low-cut blouse. What's the correct protocol? Should I ignore the obvious, or should I look closer to be sure I am seeing it correctly? Should I compliment her on her nice tattoo? What exactly am I to do while she's ringing up my purchase? — BAFFLED IN THE MIDWEST DEAR BAFFLED: I'm so glad you asked! What you should do is keep your eyes focused on the tally the computer monitor shows to be sure the checker is ringing up your purchase correctly. It's the way to make the "breast" of a touchy situation. Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

# Wild jumbo tramples man to death in Kerala

KALPETTA: A man was trampled to death and four forest officers injured in a wild elephant attack at Panamaram in Wayanad on Tuesday morning. The deceased is Kaliyar Thotathil Raghavan, 74, a native of Kuppumchal in Panamaram. According to the Forest Department officers, Raghavan was returning home after supplying milk at a shop around 6 am when he was attacked by the wild elephant.  Later, the local residents found him and took him to Manathavady District Hospital, but his life could not be saved. “Four department officers who tried to send the elephant back to the forest were also attacked by the animal. They suffered minor injuries and were immediately taken to a hospital,” said Range Forest Officer Biju K V.  The forest officers suspect the elephant must have entered human inhabited area early Tuesday morning. Following the wild animal attack, Wayanad Sub-Collector N S K Umesh enforced section 144 of CrPC that prohibits the public from visiting a particular area, at Cherukattoor village near Panamaram.<|im_end|>

# Eni : Italy's Eni makes major oil find in Angola | MarketScreener

The find is Angola's largest offshore discovery in years and may help Africa's second-biggest crude producer avoid a steep decline in output due to the ageing of its other fields. Oil accounts for 95 percent of exports and around 70 percent of revenues, and the government has recently offered better fiscal terms and more collaboration to international energy firms in an effort to help its mostly impoverished population. Eni said its new Agogo prospect in Angola's deep waters contained between 450 million and 650 million barrels of light oil with potential for further upside. Data from the exploration well pointed to a production capacity of more than 20,000 barrels of oil per day, it said. "This is a valuable find of light, sweet oil which they will be able to fast-track to meet increasing demand in 2020-2021," Santander oil analyst Jason Kenney said. Eni, which has been in Angola since 1980, will be operator at the field with a stake of 36.8 percent, the same as Angola's state-owned Sonangol. SSI Fifteen Ltd has 26.3 percent. Angola, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is a key location for the Italian state-controlled major. The company currently produces around 155,000 barrels of equity oil equivalent per day in the African nation. Eni, which in 2018 produced 1.85 million barrels per day, was struggling to replace reserves a decade ago and lost credibility over its management of the huge Kashagan oilfield in Kazakhstan. But giant gas finds at Mamba in Mozambique and Zohr in Egypt have since given it the strongest discovery record in the industry. The major, which produces more than half its oil and gas in Africa, has made a move to diversify away from the continent by clinching a series of deals in the Gulf region. It is set to uncover its new strategy plan to 2022 on Friday. (Reporting by Stephen Jewkes; Editing by Dale Hudson)<|im_end|>

# Iowa vs Cincinnati: Live Stream, How to Watch NCAA Tournament Online, TV Channel, Start Time

The second day of Round One of the NCAA Tournament starts off with a bang, as #10 Iowa travels to Columbus to take on #7 Cincinnati. It’s going to be a raucous home crowd for the in-state Bearcats, but the Hawkeyes won’t be pushed around after a tough season in the Big Ten.  How to Watch the NCAA Tournament First Round:  Iowa vs Cincinnati  Date: Friday, March 22  Time: 12:00 p.m. ET  Location: Columbus, OH  TV Channel: CBS  #10 Iowa  After a fantastic start to the season, full of great wins and quite a few buzzer-beaters, the Iowa Hawkeyes struggled heavily down the stretch, losing five of their last six to finish the year with a 22-11 record and a bad loss to Michigan in the quarterfinal of the Big Ten Tournament. Iowa is still part of March Madness, and maybe the craziness of the NCAA Tournament is exactly what the Hawkeyes need to recapture that early magic that helped them win so many close games. In forwards Tyler Cook and Luka Garza as well as guard Jordan Bohannon they have the talent, and in senior Nicholas Baer they have the experience and leadership. Recent results don’t give the Hawkeyes much hope in their first tournament appearance in three years, but they’ve already proven this season that they are capable of doing a lot of unexpected things.  #7 Cincinnati  The Cincinnati Bearcats arrive in the NCAA Tournament for the ninth consecutive year full of confidence after a strong regular season that ended with eight wins in the last 10 games, the AAC Tournament title and a 28-6 overall record. Built on a strong, physical defense and led by an outstanding junior guard in Jarron Cumberland, who had a 33-point, 8-rebound performance in the AAC Tournament final against Houston, the Bearcats are hoping for at least a trip to the second round, and maybe their first Sweet Sixteen appearance since 2012.

# The unusual music career of Prayut Chan-o-cha

This side of his life is not covered as often in the English media as it is in the Thai media. We only get the edicts and hot-headed retorts of our military prime minister. It is not often we get to see his musical side.  Military coups in Thailand are not bloody events like they are in other countries. In 2006 when the tanks rolled in, Thai civilians reacted by presenting the soldiers with roses.  Things weren't perhaps so rosy in 2014 when the military toppled Yingluck's government. But the moment the army took over, our brand new unelected prime minister did something not too many despots do, let alone think of. He penned a song.  It took him an hour, allegedly. This happened not two weeks after the coup. The song was a ballad titled Return Happiness To The Thai People, which became Prayut's catchphrase.  He wrote the lyrics, making him the Bernie Taupin of the Thai music world. But as we know, Bernie would be a struggling pensioner today had he not teamed up with his more famous other half in the early 1970s. Where was Prayut's Elton John?  Being a brand new military dictator, Prayut had a lot of folks rushing to kowtow and ingratiate themselves before him. A smattering of those glute-lickers were musical types. Before we knew it, a melody had been put to his words and a singer was found. Wasn't that quick?  Thailand doesn't have a national song chart like, say, Billboard or the Official UK Chart. We cannot say, then, that Return Happiness was a No.1 smash but by goodness, it would have been Thailand's Gangnam Style had there been such a chart!  What a massive hit it was. It's a power ballad, the kind Westlife or the Backstreet Boys probably could have covered in an afternoon in the studio. It's also a love song, the type where the guy pleads with the girl to give him a chance to prove himself. The chorus went like this: "All you must do is trust and put your faith in us. Very soon the country will be great again, return happiness to you, the people!"  Red-necked Americans would immediately bristle at these lyrics, for indeed, they appear to be a direct rip-off of “Make America Great Again!”, only this song precedes Trump by two years. Also, MTGA is hardly an attractive moniker sewn onto a red cap.  The song has had millions of hits on YouTube, though the official version stands at just 2.9 million. I am surprised by this, or perhaps heartened, considering this country has 68 million people. Clearly not everybody was racing to play the song voluntarily – and this sentiment is echoed by the fact all comments for the video have been disabled.  Perhaps there was no need to play it on YouTube, since it permeated daily life at all times and when least expected. There were parody versions, too – the second-highest viewed version featured the Chipmunks.  So who teamed up with the prime minister? His name is Vichien Tantipimonphan, a bespectacled, highly-sought-after songwriter who has penned some monster hits in this country. Without detracting from his clear ability to tap into mass musical tastes, the man writes power ballads for television soaps over and over again to the point where they do start to sound a little familiar. Think of Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Relax and Two Tribes.  But this guy really does churn out the hits. Do you remember last year's monster TV series, called Buppesaniwat, the period piece about Ayutthaya? Guess who wrote the smash hit from that series all on his own without a military lyricist?  I imagine Vichien living in some mansion off Sukhumvit with all sorts of Cambodian maids and Burmese drivers ferrying him to his record company in a gold Lamborghini.  There was a mystery surrounding the song as well. As it permeated the airwaves, the question came up – who was the singer? Only in Thailand would a military dictator release a single. Only in Thailand, too, would a song become a hit single without anyone knowing who sang the thing.  Many pointed to the melody writer himself. Vichien may have lain down the track that became as ubiquitous as som tam for a year. It certainly sounds like him. Another Lamborghini please, Siam Motors, for the man with the glasses! (It was in 2019 that the army officially claimed Cherdsak Rittikornkul was the vocalist. I would suggest you read that with a salt shaker close by.)  This extraordinary story, and scenario, does not stop here. The songwriting talents of Chan-o-cha/Tantipimonphan were not confined to the files of one-hit wonder. For a while there, in Thailand at least, they superseded Bacharach-David or Lennon and McCartney.  In December 2015, Prayut followed up his debut single with a new song. As any recording artist will tell you, the sophomore album or song is crucial. It makes or breaks you. This time around it was titled Because You Are Thailand (again, about bringing a bright future to Thailand). It wasn't a huge success. An MV featuring Prayut in his various works probably didn't set the charts on fire. At least we knew who the singer was this time round – a man named Sub Lt Pongsathorn Pojit, who to this day has sung on every release since. Then they came, song after song, being released to the public and played often.  The entertainment industry is cruel, though. Fame is fleeting. What was popular, say, five years ago is fodder for fuddy-duddies now. By 2018, the artist was grasping at straws. A Valentine's Day single, Diamond Heart (about bringing a bright future to Thailand) while attracting 700,000 views on YouTube also attracted a record number of dislikes, outnumbering the likes by five to one.  Fight For The Country (about bringing a bright future to Thailand) came out the same time of Vichien's major success, the song from the TV show Buppesaniwat. The only problem was… Prayut's song was very, very similar.  In January 2019, he released In Memory (about bringing a bright future to Thailand) and it stiffed. The magic had gone. Things were looking down. I am reminded of the last gasps of so many other artists – Michael Jackson's Invincible, Katy Perry's Witness, Spice Girls' Forever. His musical career was over; he had worn out his welcome.  Earlier this month he released a new song. The eighth of his career. It's called New Day, and it's all about bringing a bright future to Thailand. In the world of music, sometimes it's best just to leave that dead horse alone and move on.  – Andrew Biggs<|im_end|>

# Test your animal knowledge with these challenges on Twitter

Name the bird, spot the lizard, and ID the bear correctly, and win bragging rights in the wild world of animal identification challenges on Twitter. Fail, and find out why from the experts. It’s a fun way to learn about the natural world from behind a computer, and we rounded up a few of our favorites so you can play along, too.  Tricky Bird ID is a bird identification challenge run by Jason Ward (@JasonWardNY), the community relations and outreach coordinator for the National Audubon Society and host of the web series Birds of North America. He started Tricky Bird ID to break down the basics of bird identification. On an ideal week, he posts a photo of a bird on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday at 8PM ET. He tries to use photos where the birds are hiding, or in motion, to make the experience more lifelike, Ward says. “Birds don’t often pose on a nice, well-lit, beautiful branch out in the open,” he says.  People can tweet their guesses for the next 30 minutes before he starts retweeting some of the winning responses. When he tweets the big reveal, he often explains the identification in more depth to help people identify backyard and neighborhood birds on their own. “My overall mission with all of this bird-centric madness is to try and introduce nature and wildlife to underserved, underrepresented communities — kids who look like I do,” says Ward, who’s African American. “We’re trying to create and inspire the next generation of birders of color, who are going to be more numerous than we are.”  This quiz is more like a scavenger hunt. On Fridays around 9AM PT, Seattle-based naturalist and writer Kelly Brenner (@MetroFieldGuide) posts clues to a creature’s ID and also sometimes gifs of Tom Hiddleston as Loki. (This is an observation, not a complaint.) Brenner’s quizzes tend to center around plants or animals that are under-appreciated and under-noticed. “My only rule is it has to be found in a city,” Brenner says.  People research the clues, and direct message Brenner when they think they’ve solved the puzzle. Around 2PM PT, she reveals the answer. “Once the time is up, I talk about each clue, and I like to link to an article or a scientific paper,” she says. While Brenner keeps track of the regular competitors on a leader board, even people who guess wrong get something out of it. “A lot of people who play, they go down the wrong path, so they’ll learn something else about it that was completely unrelated.”   Here are your 4 #StreetCreatures clues which will reveal the next #2019MMM combatant. — Kelly Brenner (@MetroFieldGuide) February 8, 2019 Vibrissae Herschel Intensive crest Domoic acid toxicosis DON'T REPLY DM me your guess and I'll tell you if you're correct. You get two tries. You have until 2:30 PST when I'll reveal. pic.twitter.com/T3UQGuJfYM Earyn McGee (@Afro_Herper) is a PhD student at the University of Arizona studying lizards in arid environments, and whether drought and climate change could screw up their food sources. She also studies how to harness social media to bring more African American women into careers in land and water management.  Those two interests come together in #FindThatLizard, a two-day challenge that starts on Tuesdays at 12PM MT when McGee posts a photo of a lizard with a different hashtag: #GuessThatLizard. Based on a snapshot and a few details, people have to guess the name of the lizard in the photo. That’s the lizard that people will have to spot hiding in the next day’s challenge: #FindThatLizard.   Thank you for playing #GuessThatLizard. This week’s challenge will feature Ctenosaura pectinata, The Mexican spiny tailed iguana. I hope this has got you guys ready for tomorrow’s #FindThatLizard challenge! Thank you again to @CisforCarla for providing the photos this week! pic.twitter.com/NngpBpeHrd — Earyn McGee, MSc (@Afro_Herper) March 19, 2019  This week you are looking for at least SIX Mexican spiny-tailed lizards, Ctenosaura pectinata. The rules: you will have until 9pm MT to #FindThatLizard x6. Feel free to post guesses in the comments with #FoundThatLizard. Good luck and thanks @CisforCarla for sharing pic.twitter.com/5dOgSbhN6x — Earyn McGee, MSc (@Afro_Herper) March 21, 2019 The fun starts at 5PM MT on Wednesdays with #FindThatLizard when McGee posts a picture of what — at first glance — is a lizard-less nature scene. But thanks to the previous day’s hints, her followers know where to look. People who think they’ve spotted the lizard (or lizards) respond with a third hashtag, #FoundThatLizard. That’s also the hashtag McGee uses when she posts the answer later that night. The winner, she says, gets bragging rights. But McGee gets something out of it, too. “I have people who tell me that they put it up in their classrooms for their students, and they play the game with their family,” she says. “It’s really heartwarming to me that this thing that I really enjoy doing out in real life is something I can bring to people who might not have had that opportunity otherwise.”  Inspired by other animal ID hashtags, ecologist Michelle LaRue started Cougar or Not back in 2015. She was working with a research nonprofit called The Cougar Network, which had a big database of photos of possible cougar sightings. “I thought it would be a fun game, hopefully educational, and it would give me a chance to do science communication about cougars, predators, and what Cougar Network does,” LaRue says in a direct message on Twitter.  The challenge starts at 11:30AM CT most Fridays, and LaRue keeps tweeting the same photo for two hours before she reveals whether the photo was in fact a cougar, or not. There isn’t really a winner to the game — unless you count the graduate student who’s analyzing the responses to more than 100 photos for her master’s degree.  Kaeli Swift (@corvidresearch), a postdoctoral scientist at Denali National Park, knows that it can be hard for the general public to identify birds in the corvid family, like crows and ravens. She’d seen LaRue’s Cougar or Not game, and one day, it just clicked: “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, ‘crow or no.’ It rhymes! Of course this has to be a game,” she says. “It was a combination of this need that I saw and my love of rhymes and puns.”  Now, every Wednesday, Swift posts a photo at 11:30AM, and her followers have to guess if it’s a crow, or no. “A crow is any bird with the word crow in its recognized English common name,” Swift says. That could include American crows or Mariana crows, for example. There are a lot of options. So part of the payoff for the challenge is learning the basic birding skill of recognizing these birds. “But it also became a way to teach people about the global biodiversity of this family and this genus of birds,” Swift says.  Danielle Rivet (@grizzlygirl87), a PhD candidate at the University of Saskatchewan, posts an ambiguous bear photo on Twitter on Tuesdays around noon CT with the hashtag #KnockKnockWhosBear. Her followers respond with guesses about the bear’s species and reasons for the guess, and after an hour she gives them a hint by tweeting the bear’s location. Three hours later, she posts the ID along with the characteristics she used to identify the species.  The challenge started because Rivet spends a lot of time looking at bear photos from her work with a camera trap database at Wapusk National Park in Canada. The camera trap is set up to monitor polar bears, but black bears and brown bears wander into frame, too. And they can be tough to tell apart. “Even for someone who has worked with bears for a long time, it can be challenging to determine what species you’re looking at,” Rivet tells The Verge in an email.  So, she decided to bring the challenge to her followers on Twitter to help them learn how to ID bears. It’s not just an academic exercise, Rivet says: for people who work or travel through bear country, there’s a practical purpose, too. “It’s important to know which species are around, how to identify them, and how to handle an encounter with that animal,” she says. “Plus, bear photos are really fun to look at!”   It's time for #KnockKnockWhosBear! — Danielle Rivet (@grizzlygirl87) March 19, 2019 Rules: Take a look at the photo below. Tell me if it's a #BrownBear or a #BlackBear, and why. In an hour, I'll post location of the photo, and in 3 hours, I'll reveal/explain. So...what species is this lovely bear? pic.twitter.com/hYBeKOJvWH<|im_end|>

# Horse riding in back of pickup doing 70mph is perfectly legal, police say

Texas is known for its outlandish cowboy charm and nothing embodies its country swagger better than this horse riding in the back of a pickup.  The clip shows a saddled brown animal standing in the back of a truck doing 70mph – and it’s perfectly legal, police say.  Kerry Costello filmed the horse, that she said was ‘secured only by a rope,’ as it rode down a highway near Corrigan, Texas on Saturday.  However dangerous it may seem, Corrigan police said nothing the driver did was illegal, Click2Houston reported.  According to Texas legislation, the driver would have been breaking the law if he ‘transported or confined the animal in a cruel manner,’ which authorities determined was not the case. Plane 'forced to return to airport after mum forgets baby in departure lounge' Police said the horse was riding in the truck bed because the driver’s other truck, one that is able to pull a horse trailer, would not start.  The horse is also ‘extremely well-trained,’ valued at over $15,000, and made it safely to its destination, according to KTRK.  Although the horse appeared relaxed, and behaved well, Costello still said it ‘could have been a dangerous situation.’  ‘I thought) anything spooks this horse, (and it’s) a danger to this horse, this driver, the other people on the road and me and my husband and our two 5-year-olds in our car,’ she said.<|im_end|>

# Richard Pryor's widow: 'He wasn't ashamed of fling with Marlon Brando'

'He'd probably fill you in on the details!': Richard Pryor's widow says the legendary comedian wasn't 'ashamed' of his fling with Marlon Brando and that he would be 'talking about it today' if he was still alive Jennifer Lee has reconfirmed that Pryor and Brando had a fling in the 1970s The story was first revealed by Quincy Jones during an interview last year Lee said Pryor was always open about 'dalliances' with men and a trans woman Said during one set in 1977, Pryor told the crowd that 'I have sucked a d**k' Richard Pryor's widow has spoken out about the comedian's fling with actor Marlon Brando, revealing that he didn't regret it. 'He wasn't ashamed of it,' Jennifer Lee, 79, told the Daily Beast. 'He would be talking about it today if he were here. He'd probably fill you in on the details!' Pryor's fling with Brando was first revealed last year by legendary music producer Quincy Jones, who said the Godfather star would 'f**k anything'. 'He was the most charming motherf****r you ever met,' Jones told Vulture last February. 'He'd f**k anything. He'd f**k a mailbox. James Baldwin. Richard Pryor. Marvin Gaye.' Richard Pryor's widow Jennifer Lee (pictured together in 1979) has confirmed that the legendary comedian had a 'dalliance' with Marlon Brando - and that he wasn't ashamed of it Pryor's fling with Brando was first revealed last year by legendary music producer Quincy Jones, who said the Godfather star (pictured in 1973) would 'f**k anything' Lee quickly confirmed the story, explaining that 'it was the seventies!' 'Drugs were still good, especially Quaaludes,' she told TMZ at the time. 'If you did enough cocaine, you'd f**k a radiator and send it flowers in the morning.' Lee revealed to Daily Beast that she called Jones after his interview and told him to 'keep telling the truth'. 'When people say, "Well let him rest in peace Jennifer, what are you doing?" then you're not a fan,' she said. 'Because Richard discussed this. He'd be pissed off that Q was getting a hard time.' Shortly after Jones' interview, one of Pryor's daughters hit out at both the producer and Lee for their comments about her father. 'Daddy did NOT have relations with Brando,' Rain Pryor, 49, wrote in one Facebook post, claiming Jones was 'losing his mind' and 'decided to garner publicity for himself with a sensationalized interview'. 'Then on top of it all, my dad's so called widow validated it, because she needs to keep legitimizing herself and tarnish our dad even after he's dead. She hated Q and Daddy,' Rain added, clearly referring to Lee. 'He would be talking about it today if he were here. He'd probably fill you in on the details!' Lee said of her late husband (pictured together after he was diagnosed with MS in 1994) But Lee said she wasn't bothered by Rain's comments, saying Pryor's child wasn't 'even a twinkle in the eye yet'. 'They don't know their father the way I know him, clearly,' she added. 'I think she's off-base. But that's okay, I wish them well.' Lee said that Pryor was always open about his 'dalliances' with men as well as a transgender woman. The legendary womanizer, who was married seven times to five different women, even discussed his relationships with men in his stand-up acts, she added. Pryor performed for a gay rights benefit show at the Hollywood Bowl in 1977 and told the crowd 'I have sucked a d**k'. But the comedian's set ended with boos after he claimed that it was the first time he realized 'f*****s are prejudiced'. 'I don't see so n*****s out here!' he told the crowd. 'And when the n*****s were burning down Watts, you motherf*****s were doing what you wanted to do on Hollywood Boulevard and didn't give a s**t about it.' Lee said the set was Pryor trying to tell the crowd that 'hey, I'm kind of one of you'. Lee said that she called Jones after his interview and told him to 'keep telling the truth' about Pryor and Brando But shortly after Jones' interview, Pryor's daughter Rain (Pictured with Richard Pryor Jr) hit out at both Jones and Lee and said that her father did not have an affair with Brando 'Not necessarily one of you,' she added. 'But I know the party, I know what happens, I'm down.' Lee first married Pryor in August 1981, only to divorce the following year. They remarried in June 2001 and stayed together until he died in 2005. The pair first met in the late 1970s - at the height of the comedian's fame - when Pryor was looking for someone who could help him decorate his new home in the San Fernando Valley. Lee, a struggling actress at the time, took the job. 'I fell in love with him the first day I met him, August 22, 1977,' she said. 'I was aware of him, but I was not a fan, which was great because I saw the person.' Lee recalled Pryor bringing 'out a different woman' every morning. He married actress Deborah McGuire shortly after meeting Lee. The couple split in 1978 after Pryor shot at his own car while McGuire tried to leave him. He was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Lee said she fell in love with Pryor the 'first day' she met him in 1977, but he first married Deborah McGuire (pictured on their wedding day) before he got involved with Lee Pryor and Lee got married in 1981. They remarried in 2001 after he begged her to come back to him following his MS diagnosis Two years later, Pryor poured rum all over his body and set himself on fire after days of freebasing cocaine. He ran down a Los Angeles street and had to be calmed down by the police before he was taken to the hospital, where he spent six weeks in recovery. Lee (pictured at the premiere of I Am Richard Pryor at SXSW on Tuesday) is now trying to get a biopic made about her late husband 'I sometimes think that Richard created chaos for comedy,' Lee said. 'It was fodder, grist for the mill as they say.' Lee said everyone asked her how she could date him after what happened with McGuire, or with everything that was going on in his personal life. 'Richard didn't want a nurse,' she said as she discussed their relationship in the new documentary I Am Richard Pryor. 'He wanted a ride-or-die b***h. He wanted somebody who could hang. I could hang.' Lee told Daily Beast that she had moved out once Pryor's cocaine addiction took over, but returned to his side following the fire incident. Things quickly 'went south' and the couple divorced, but Lee said they 'never stopped loving each other'. But the couple continued to date on and off through the years and, when Pryor was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1986, he begged her to come back to him for good. Eventually, she gave in. 'He had been asking me, and I said, "No, you had your chance, you blew it, you screwed up,"' she recalled. But Lee said she then realized that what she had with the comedian was 'what real love is'. 'I sometimes think that Richard created chaos for comedy,' Lee said of her husband's legendary sets. 'It was fodder, grist for the mill as they say' 'It's not just about the party and the fun and when everything's going well,' she said. 'It's about the rough stuff. And here, you didn't get any rougher. I had to deal with so many fires to put out - pun intended.' Now Lee is hoping to finally get a biopic about Pryor's life on screen after she originally tried to produce it with Harvey Weinstein. Lee revealed that Weinstein even wore his now infamous bathrobe to one of their meetings, although she said he didn't try anything with her. 'I aged out,' she said, referring to the dozens upon dozens of accusations of sexual harassment and assault from young actresses against Weinstein. 'But it was still inappropriate. I don't let my gardener see me in my bathrobe. I mean come on, it's a business meeting dude!' she added. Lee said she's now doing a 'complete reset' for the film and also plans to publish Pryor's diaries and journals in the near future.<|im_end|>

# Horrific domestic violence flare-ups emerge after floods

Horrific domestic violence flare-ups emerge after floods  CASES of domestic violence abusers making off with family emergency payments or refusing to leave an ex-partner's home after being granted shelter have emerged after Townsville's catastrophic floods.  The ripple effect of the historic weather event has also caused a backlog in court and welfare systems designed to help victims.  North Queensland Domestic Violence Resource Service co-ordinator Pauline Woodbridge said the office had seen an increase in the number of protection order applications in recent weeks as victims are able to again address domestic violence issues.  "As the days have gone on, there have been other things emerging such as quite a lot of families where there is domestic violence, were eligible for the $1000 crisis payments," she said.  "We heard many women tell us the abusers took the $1000 and disappeared for a couple of days.  "Some of the families that were already separated had to go back to live with the ex-partner or the ex-abuser and then he would take the money for example.  "We are now in a period where people are coming forward to get their domestic violence issues dealt with, things like where an ex-partner came and moved in because his place was flooded and now they can't get him to leave and he's being abusive."  Ms Woodbridge said Townsville's specialist domestic violence court, forced to close for about ten days, had also been affected.  It is understood more than 45 domestic violence protection order applications were listed in the specialist court yesterday, with 30 more listed for tomorrow and more than 60 on Friday.  The usual number according to NQDVRS is about 120 protection order application listings a week.  Ms Woodbridge said the system backlog has also affected crisis accommodation with Townsville's shelters unable to accept women fleeing violence from outside the region.  "The women's shelters, if they get a vacancy it is needed for someone local," she said.  "And where women would normally leave the shelter after a certain period of time, they can't leave because they have nowhere to go."  Official Queensland Police statistics revealed breach of domestic violence order offences hit a near record high of 350 offences in January but fell to 198 offences in February.  January was the fourth month in a row that the number of breach of domestic violence order offences increased. There were 268 offences of this type in December, 227 in November and 223 in October.  Townsville Police domestic and family violence co-ordinator Sergeant Elise Feltham said the stress of the floods would undoubtedly have an impact on families.  "We are aware of this and will always respond at times of crisis and investigate incidents fully, with the intention of keeping a victim safe and holding a perpetrator of violence accountable," she said.  James Cook University senior lecturer Dr Ann Carrington said research shows natural disasters could be a trigger for a spike in domestic violence.  "I guess it's important to recognise though that it doesn't create domestic violence as such, but the change in circumstances would increase the intensity, or increase the experience in any relationship that already had domestic violence within it," she said.  "Sometimes it's not actually an increase but through overcrowding people are noticing it because it's usually behind closed doors."<|im_end|>

# College admissions process equability questioned following scandal

College admissions process equability questioned following scandal  NEW HAVEN — Tens of thousands of Americans each year apply to elite colleges, but a scandal involving alleged test score tampering and sports coach bribery has thrown into question whether the process by which applicants are evaluated is designed to maintain the status of the nation’s gentry.  Fifty people were charged Tuesday after a number allegedly paid up to six figures to cheat the admissions systems of elite colleges, including Yale University, either through tampering with college entrance exam scores or by bribing athletic coaches into recommending non-athletes for their teams.  “Coaches do get a number of spots on their list,” said Joie Jager-Hyman, a former Dartmouth College assistant director of admissions and founder and president of college counseling firm College Prep 360. “Their applications get read well before the regular applications get read.”  Jager-Hyman said coaches do get a “rubber stamp” for a small handful of applicants so long as athletes meet some minimum standards: basically whether admissions officers feel confident they won’t fail out of the school.  Rudolph Meredith, a former Yale women’s soccer coach, was implicated in the documents filed in the U.S. District Court, alleging he solicited and accepted bribes to recruit students to his team. In a letter to stakeholders, Yale President Peter Salovey said he was “dismayed and disturbed,” and Yale itself is a victim.  A spokesman for Yale declined to comment Wednesday.  “As a regular applicant, there’s a different process,” said Jager-Hyman.  She said regional admissions officers will read applications and develop a brief summary for the larger admissions committee. Applications are reviewed to see whether students are exceptional, she said, and it’s often not enough to just be “good at everything.”  “You need a compelling reason for them to take you,” she said.  On average, she said, every applicant who makes it past a first round will be discussed for about 10 minutes.  Jeffrey Milem, dean of University of California Santa Barbara’s Gevirtz School, said the college admissions process often reproduces and reinforces various inequities.  “Kids who come from means, however you want to define that, have historically always been advantaged in the admissions process,” he said.  “They almost always attend better schools, whether public or private, they have access to test-taking courses, they have access to hiring admissions consultants to work with them to develop their file for admission and help them craft their responses to essay prompts,” he said. “By attending wealthier schools, they have more of an opportunity to take advanced placement classes, which are the types of things that factor into admissions decisions at institutions with a highly selective admissions process.”  “The vast majority of elite institutions in this country have always been or for a long time were very exclusionary,” Milem said. “Legacy admissions further privilege wealthy people, because the parents of kids who apply under legacy were from wealthier backgrounds, and as time goes on that pool of legacy grows.”  Milem said the idea of meritocracy that elite colleges speak of has been dismissed by some in his field.  “One thing we know about the typical measures of merit we use — grades and test scores and such — kids from higher income backgrounds score better on all those indicators,” he said. “Some campuses are not engaging in a more robust process they call holistic review that looks at a variety of factors and doesn’t place such a heavy emphasis on traditional measures of merit.”  On its admissions website, Yale assures applicants the process is done methodically.  “As we carefully and respectfully review every application, two questions guide our admissions team: ‘Who is likely to make the most of Yale’s resources?’ and ‘Who will contribute most significantly to the Yale community?’” the site says. “We estimate that over three-quarters of the students who apply for admission to Yale are qualified to do the work here. The great majority of students who are admitted stand out from the rest because a lot of little things, when added up, tip the scale in their favor.”  Jager-Hyman said no student gets in without demonstrating some measure of merit, but elite schools are looking for something that differentiates candidates, or that proves their worth to the institution.  “They’re looking at what you contribute,” Jager-Hyman said. “Not everybody gets in for the same reason.”  What those reasons are, she said, could run the gamut. She said in her role at Dartmouth there was a wall between the admissions department and the development department, but the two do talk.  “It’s not bribes,” she said. “But every student is there for a reason.”  Jager-Hyman said she had never seen a culture of bribery in admissions, but it’s no secret that money can buy advantages. “Mega donors” might get more than a 10-minute discussion, she said, but it’s possible for them to hear no.  “They say no all day,” she said. “But you have to think about why you’re saying no.”  Jager-Hyman said it is in the best interests of higher education admissions departments to be relatively vague about what criteria they use to admit students, as it drives up the number of applications they receive.  In New Haven’s Westville neighborhood, Hopkins School educates 716 students from 60 municipalities from around the state for a tuition of $43,500. Twenty-two percent of students receive financial aid and the average class size is 12 students.  Starting as juniors, students have regular contact with college counselors, who work with them individually to prepare them for post-graduation.  Erika Chapin, the school’s director of college counseling, told the Hearst Connecticut Media in 2017 that students get personalized attention, focusing on their passions and preferences.  At the beginning of this academic year, New Haven’s public schools laid off 24 educators, mainly school counselors and library media specialists. A number of counselors are now intermittent, splitting their time between multiple schools. In 2016, school board member Darnell Goldson alleged that a number of New Haven college applications did not make it to schools before the proper deadline because they did not leave guidance offices on time.  Daniel Cocchiola, coordinator of counseling and career pathways at Hamden High School, said his perspective on Tuesday’s scandal is that an entire college admissions industry has emerged of private consultants promising students and their families guaranteed admission into elite schools.  “When I’m interacting with private consultants when I’m visiting admissions activities at colleges, I recognize that what they’re promising oftentimes seems different to the reality of what I’m faced with,” he said. “I wonder how you can be so sure about an admission. This scandal speaks to me about the level that people would lie to get access.”  Cocchiola said that, as a public school guidance department, he believes Hamden and other school districts like West Haven, Cheshire and Wallingford give students exceptional school-based resources. In Hamden High School, there are eight counselors, each with a case load below the recommended amount.  “Our district values students having post-secondary education,” he said.  What matters in college admissions, he said, is that counselors work with students early in their high school careers so they’re prepared to apply to school by the time they reach senior year.  “There are three things colleges look at: first is academic record, second is scores like the SAT and ACT and third is the student as a human being,” Cocchiola said. “I would roughly say about 50 percent is academic record, a third is board scores and the remaining 15 percent is how they are as a human being.”  brian.zahn@hearstmediact.com<|im_end|>

# Brutal NCAA tourney loss to Auburn puts exclamation point on season of flux for Kansas

So this is how the end of an era, or at least a radical outlier, looks:  As a whirlwind Auburn team seized a 20-9 lead over Kansas on another fast-break three-pointer by Bryce Brown in their NCAA Tournament Midwest Regional game on Saturday at Vivint Smart Home Arena, KU coach Bill Self stood in a hapless, hopeless pose on the sideline. Exasperation radiating from his red face, he turned one way and then another. He seemed to start to speak to no one in particular as he perhaps sought an answer out of the literally thin air here.  Seconds later, Brown, ho-hum, did it again, and you already knew by then there was no solving this mess for KU.  The fourth-seeded Jayhawks trailed 51-25 at halftime after the fifth-seeded Tigers swamped them 26-1 in fast-break points on the way to an 89-75 dismantling.  Sign Up and Save  Get six months of free digital access to the Miami Herald  #ReadLocal  In the process of being bulldozed, KU squandered a chance to play in the Sweet 16 at Sprint Center next week, where in essence it would have been playing with house money ladled in gravy after a season of flux.  The loss, which came after KU had offered some glimmers of hope by winning nine of its last 12, put an exclamation point on how much this season deviated from what’s become routine under Bill Self and eluded him and his team (26-10) this season.  Not only did KU’s streak of 14 straight Big 12 titles come to an end this season, but now so has another remarkable standard: The loss to Auburn, the Southeastern Conference Tournament champion that won its 10th straight game, extinguished a trend that had gone back to 2000 and had become a staple since Self took over in 2003.  Until Saturday, every Kansas season since the loss to Duke in 2000 had ended with either a conference title, advancing to the second weekend of the tournament and beyond, or both.  And now … a humbling.  “You don’t get a ring for winning a game in the tournament,” Self said in the wake of Kansas’ first-round romp over Northeastern.  Instead of adding more bling, the Jayhawks will head into an offseason of uncertainty with an ugly loss in their craw and little to console them by way of accomplishment.  Or as Self put it on Thursday when he considered the potential impact of this game: “Even though the year didn’t go exactly as we had it scripted, I do think in our fans’ minds and certainly in my mind, in our players’ minds, it takes the sting off of that totally if you perform very well in the tournament.”  So the sting will stick now as KU and its fans are left to wonder what might have been — both in terms of if Udoka Azubuike hadn’t been injured and Silvio De Sousa had been eligible and had they managed to make their way back to Kansas City and a de facto home game against the winner of the matchup Sunday between top-seeded North Carolina and ninth-seeded Washington.  That homecoming guaranteed nothing, of course, especially considering KU just lost to Iowa State in its last game at Sprint Center and was upended there as a No. 1 seed by No. 3 seed Oregon in a 2017 Elite Eight game.  Just the same, the possibilities sure would have been intriguing and might have produced one of the most enticing games of the tournament if the Jayhawks were taking on the Tar Heels and former KU coach Roy Williams.  Instead, KU added to the tournament thuds of some of the Big 12’s most prominent prospects: Regular-season co-champion Kansas State, a No. 4 seed, fizzled out Friday in the first round against 13th-seeded UC Irvine, and in a 6-11 upset Big 12 Tournament champ Iowa State tumbled to Ohio State later in the day.  Even with no seniors on a team that started five players, including four freshmen, who’d never played in an NCAA Tournament before, KU fans also are left to wonder what’s ahead.  Azubuike, Dedric Lawson and Quentin Grimes, who struggled early but found himself some late in the season, all seem questionable to return. Perhaps others won’t be back. And who’s to say what’s yet to come amid the lingering uncertainty of the FBI Adidas probe?  Now, roster turnover is a constant for program that currently has 11 players in the NBA, most of whom left before their eligibility expired. And as long as Kansas is guided by Self, one of the best to ever coach the game, the program will regenerate and remain in the upper echelon. You should bet next year Kansas will make its record 31st straight NCAA appearance.  But for the first time in 15 years, Kansas’ season ended with no Big 12 title behind it, nothing of note accomplished in the NCAA Tournament and more questions than obvious answers.  And a sting that will linger for a program going into the offseason with less achievement or momentum than it has in nearly two decades.<|im_end|>

# GRAPHIC VIDEO: Mum of murdered teen releases harrowing CCTV of him being stabbed to death

** WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW ** Azaan Kaleem, 18, known by his pals as “AJ,” was stabbed 20 times simply for being accused of giving the thugs a “funny look”, in Hartsfield Road, Luton, last year. His mum Roseann Taylor has now spoken out about the heartbreaking moment she was forced to kiss her son goodbye behind a hospital curtain, in new BBC documentary Stabbed: Britain’s Knife Crime Crisis. Remembering the night of her son’s murder, Roseann said: "It was mayhem. There was police everywhere. "There was a helicopter flying and I could just see people around him. “No mum should have to stroke their child's head and kiss them goodbye and wait for their heartbeat to stop” Roseann Taylor "The helicopter paramedics came down and they just kept working on him and working on him. “I didn't know if it was serious, not serious. Nobody would tell me anything.” Tragically, AJ had been stabbed in the heart in the savage attack. Roseann added: "I went to see him as they wheeled him into theatre and he was grey and he was cold and he was wet and I kissed him, told him I loved him. “Told him I would see him soon and the next time I saw him was in intensive care. He was brain dead." Roseann was then told to "round everyone up to say goodbye". "What should have been a private moment, there was no control,” she said. “There was no...what a mother should normally do. "Even switching off his machine was witnessed by the police. "People could hear outside the curtains. It was just...there was no dignity. "No mum should have to stroke their child's head and kiss them goodbye and wait for their heartbeat to stop. "It should never happen and this is why I want to share what I'm sharing because it should never have happened." The brave mum allowed the CCTV of her son’s final moments be shown in the documentary. She hopes sickening footage will provoke action to be taken over Britain’s surging knife crime epidemic. Stabbed: Britain's Knife Crime Crisis is available on BBC iPlayer.<|im_end|>

# Canterbury mum Francesca Wood's baby born weighing one pound

Incredible images capture the first moments of a baby girl who weighed ONE POUND when she was born 14 weeks premature - and doctors took photos 'in case she didn't survive' Francesca Wood, 30, woke up in pool of blood when she was 26 weeks pregnant Mother-of-two from Canterbury couldn't hold tiny Eden for a week after birth Doctors believed she had 90 per cent chance of dying as lungs weren't matured Little Eden is now two and has 'defied all odds' to become happy, healthy toddler A mother-of-two whose premature baby was born weighing just 1lb has told how the little girl defied the odds - despite being told she had a 10 per cent chance of survival. Francesca Wood, 30, from Canterbury, was 26 weeks (six-and-a-half months) pregnant when she woke up in a pool of blood and was told her daughter had to be delivered immediately. But Baby Eden amazed doctors when she pulled through after weeks of medical care - and she is now a happy, healthy two-year-old. 'It was so frightening to be surrounded by so many doctors and to be giving birth three months prematurely,' Francesca recalled. 'I had no option but to trust them to save my daughter.' 'She was delivered by emergency C-section weighing just one tiny pound and the anaesthetist took photos of her born for me, in case she didn't survive.' After Eden, pictured after being born, was delivered at just 26 weeks (just over six months) she was put in an incubator and hooked up to a ventilator Francesca, pictured with Eden, was already in hospital when she started bleeding as she has antisynthetase syndrome, a rare inflammatory muscle disease Now two-years-old Eden, pictured, is healthy and her mother said people would never know she was so tiny as a newborn. The youngster Miraculously though, Eden is fighting fit with no health problems - something Francesca thought she might never see. 'My first thought was how I would tell my son Oakley that he would never meet his sister,' said the mother-of-two. 'He had been so excited to become a big brother.' Francesca was told her baby had to be delivered immediately and was rushed into theatre where 20 medical professionals were there to attend to her. 'I wasn't allowed to hold her and only got to touch her hand quickly before she was whisked off to NICU,' she explained. Baby Eden, pictured as a newborn, only weighed 1lb when she entered the world but she has miraculously defied all odds to survive after weeks of medical care in hospital An anaesthetist took photos of 1lb Eden being pulled from the womb so that Francesca could keep them, in case her baby didn't survive The day Francesca started bleeding, she was already at St Thomas' Hospital in London after being admitted at 21 weeks pregnant. She was diagnosed with antisynthetase syndrome after having her eldest child, Oakley, a rare inflammatory muscle disease. 'While pregnant with Eden, the condition I have was making me short of breath and causing muscle weakness,' she explained. 'I was admitted and put on bed rest so I could be monitored closely. I was told I wasn't going anywhere until the baby was born.' Mother-of-two Francesca, pictured with Eden, had to wait one week before she could hold her daughter Little Eden, pictured as a newborn, was only the size of a syringe when she was born and had to remain in hospital She continued: 'At 26 weeks, I woke up feeling warm and the sheets were wet. At first I thought I'd wet myself but when I pulled back the sheets and saw a pool of blood, I started panicking. I was sure I was losing Eden.' 'I was devastated. Especially because she felt like a miracle to me already. I had previously been told it was extremely unlikely I would have any more kids after Oakley, because I'd had one fallopian tube removed and the other was blocked.' 'It had always been a dream of mine to have a big family, so when I fell pregnant by chance with her I was over the moon.' Francesca, who is no longer with the fathers of her children, has praised her seven-year-old son Oakley for being her rock throughout her latest pregnancy. The little girl, pictured with her big brother Oakley, was born three months early and came home four weeks before her due date when she was 4lbs Francesca, pictured, had one fallopian tube removed after having her son and didn't think she'd be able to have more children. She said having Eden 'felt like a miracle' 'Oakley couldn't wait to meet his baby sister,' she said. 'He was always saying "Mummy let me feel your tummy" and played music for her, choosing songs and putting a headphone on my bellybutton. He was in love with her before she was even born.' After Eden was delivered by emergency C-section, she was put in an incubator and hooked up to a ventilator, while her mother was sent to ICU herself. 'I spent a night in the ICU for monitoring as I had lost a lot of blood and the epidural had punctured my spine,' she explained. 'I kept saying to everyone, "All I want is to see my baby." It was an agonising two days before I finally got to meet my princess.' Francesca said Oakley, pictured with Eden once she got older, wants to play with her sister all the time and that they connected straight away Francesca said that the first few days with Eden, pictured, were difficult and had to be taken 'hour by hour' Oakley 'adores' his baby sister, pictured together, and Eden is like any happy and healthy toddler now Francesca was taken to the NICU in Evelina London Children's Hospital, where Eden was being cared for. 'She may have been tiny but she was so perfect,' she said. 'The doctors said she had a 90 per cent chance of dying because her lungs were not nearly as matured as they should have been. But as the seconds, minutes and hours ticked by, Eden proved us all wrong.' 'I can't thank the staff at the Evelina enough. I owe the team of doctors and nurses there for saving my daughter's life.' When Eden was one week old, Francesca held her for the first time. 'She was placed on me, skin-to-skin, and it was a feeling like no other,' said the proud mum. 'It was like holding a baby animal. She was very fragile and was attached to lots of wires.' 'I was so in love but constantly worried about getting too emotionally attached, in case the worst happened.' She added: 'At the beginning, it wasn't even a case of take each day as it comes, we had to take it hour by hour. Things could change by the second and she sometimes stopped breathing. I learnt to rub her tummy to get her breathing again.' Baby Eden, pictured, has surprised everybody by overcoming every obstacle she's faced. Pictured, flashing a smile to the camera When she was born, doctors said that Eden, pictured, had a 90% chance of dying because her lungs were not nearly as matured as they should have been 'She continued to get stronger and none of us could believe how well she was doing. Amazingly, she came home four weeks before her due date when she was 4lbs.' From the moment Oakley and Eden met, they developed a strong bond as brother and sister. 'When Oakley met her, they connected straightaway and he wanted to do everything with her,' she explained. 'He helped feed her, change her nappies and he also wanted to play with her all the time.' 'Oakley adores his sister and I find myself worrying more about my son than I do my daughter – she is a real fighter and been through so much already, I know she can deal with anything!' Francesca, pictured, said she's determined to be healthy so that she can watch her children grow up together Francesca said that when Eden was born it was a very 'tense and rocky time' but that she's looking forward to the future with her two children, pictured Eden, pictured as a baby, was cared for in NICU in Evelina London Children's Hospital Francesca will never forget what she and two-year-old Eden went through, and says that no one would ever guess her daughter was born three months early. 'Eden has defied the doctors her whole short life,' she explained. 'With regards to her development, you would never think she was only half-cooked when she was born, or that she had been through such a traumatic start to life. She is a happy, crazy beautiful and funny little soul.' 'When I look back at the newborn photos of her, I remember how scared I felt. It was a very tense and rocky time, especially with the medical teams telling me her percentage of survival was next to none. 'Yet she defied all odds and made each step look easy. It will always amaze me how she managed to survive.' 'I am not as healthy as I'd like to be and often struggle with my muscle disease, but I am determined to stay around to watch her and Oakley grow up together.'<|im_end|>

# How much money does Michael Jackson's estate still make in his name?

In the wake of Leaving Neverland airing on Channel 4, interest in Michael Jackson's affairs is rife. Fans and viewers alike are revisiting his marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, researching what Macaulay Culkin has said about sexual abuse allegations, and wondering how much money the singer has made since he died in 2009. According to Forbes' list of The Highest-Paid Dead Celebrities Of 2018, Jackson made the most money out of any famous person who has passed away last year, topping their list. The publication claims the performer hauled in $400 million in 12 months, mostly from the sale of his EMI Music Publishing stake. "Additional cash comes from his Mijac Music catalogue, a new Sony record deal and projects like TV special Michael Jackson’s Halloween, which returned to CBS on October 20 for the second consecutive year," they note.  The Sun also report that following Michael's death, his estate hired a team of 'accountants and legal experts' to look after his finances, who claim to have generated gross earnings exceeding £973million in that time. In legal papers filed at Los Angeles Superior Court by the estate’s executors, lawyers stated they had “successfully rebuilt and enhanced Jackson’s image”. Another 73-page document filed in Los Angeles in 2015 allegedly also revealed that Michael's estate raked in $74 million that year, with 'Thriller' alone generating $2.5 million,. It also claimed the merchandising arm of his estate, Triumph, brought in $18.8 million in the same 12-month period.  Jackson's money is divided between his mother Katherine, who gets 40% of his assets, his three children, who get 40% between them, and several children's charities, who get the remaining 20% (via ABC News).<|im_end|>

# Stranger Things' Max's mysterious background before Hawkins revealed in prequel

Stranger Things’s Max has always had an air of mystery about her – but a new prequel release is set to finally reveal how she came to live in Hawkins, Indiana.  Ahead of the season three launch (which still seems like ages away and it’s hurting us), Netflix revealed the cover art for a new prequel novella with Max (Sadie Sink) as the leading lady.  The punk-inspired cover art is all kinds of bright pink neon and black-and-white cutaways, with the title Runaway Max giving us rock and roll vibes.  Runaway Max will see what happened to the character and her brother Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery) in their past that caused them to end up in the quiet suburban life of Hawkins.  Sadie Sink joined the cast as Max in season two, and quickly became a firm friend with the four leading kids, whose extra-terrestrial adventures and missions quickly make up a lot of the show’s plotlines.  Now, Max and Billy have well and truly found themselves a home – with Max even getting her first boyfriend in the form of Lucas (played by Caleb McLaughlin).   Ahead of the book announcement, 16-year-old Sadie had revealed what was in store for the gang in season three, and even teased her past could be explored.  Speaking to W Magazine, Sadie said: ‘Forget about sci-fi—it’s just about what’s going on with them and being teenagers in the summer, going to the mall, doing normal teenager stuff.  ‘You really dive deep into who the characters are and their backstories this season, and then as the season goes on, it gets into the stranger things.’  Stranger Things season 3 returns to Netflix this July.<|im_end|>

# As Elections Near, Duterte Adds Dozens Seeking Office to His Deadly Drug List

MANILA — Two months ahead of elections in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has publicly released a new list of people that he claims are “narcopoliticians,” vowing his remaining three years in office will be the bloodiest yet in his war on drugs. The list, released Thursday night, includes the names of 46 officials — 33 mayors, eight deputy mayors, one ex-mayor, a provincial board member and three members of Congress. In the past, many of those who were listed ended up dead at the hands of policemen or vigilantes. Almost all of those named are running for office in May, when Filipinos go to the polls to choose senators, representatives, mayors and other local officials. Many are political opponents of Mr. Duterte, and he is again being widely accused of playing deadly politics against his critics. “I will just be clear that my last remaining years will be the most dangerous years for a person into drug trafficking,” Mr. Duterte said over national television from the southern city of Davao, his hometown, where he released the list. He said that those in the drug business “flaunt their joys and happiness” on social media while ordinary citizens wallow in drug addiction and poverty. “My decision to unmask these drug personalities was anchored on my trust in the government agencies who have vetted and validated the narco list,” Mr. Duterte said, stressing that since he was elected to office in 2016 he has “committed to eradicate the drug problem.” The government’s interior department has already filed administrative cases against the officials he named, while the Anti-Money Laundering Council and the state’s anti-corruption commission would help track down any illegally acquired wealth. However, while Mr. Duterte said the list of names was vetted, he did not confirm that formal criminal cases had been filed against the officials. The president said that among those on the list are people associated with Proceso Alcala, an agriculture minister under former President Benigno Aquino III, whom Mr. Duterte has accused of being traffickers. Neither Mr. Aquino nor Mr. Alcala could be reached for comment. Mr. Duterte insisted, however, that the new list had nothing to do with politics. “I’m not really interested in releasing it before or after the elections,” Mr. Duterte said. “I don’t have the slightest intention of hurting anybody, or to cause a certain man who wants to serve the public not to be elected.” Shortly after he took office, he released the first of his drug lists, accusing 150 judges, mayors, policemen and military officers of being involved in the drug trade. He never explained how he came up with the list, and his aides said that the president had his own sources. Many of those in that original list have been killed — including about a dozen mayors and several vice mayors — usually gunned down either in police encounters or by pro-government vigilantes. Among those slain was a mayor who had already surrendered, but was gunned down by police officers who raided his jail cell. In July last year, two mayors were gunned down a day apart. One of them, Antonio Halili, of Tanauan City, about 40 miles south of Manila, was killed by a sniper during a flag ceremony. More than 5,000 people — and perhaps thousands more who have gone unreported — have been killed in Mr. Duterte’s drug war. Nearly all of them were killed in similar circumstances, with the police typically saying the person pulled a gun, prompting a fatal gun battle. Vicente Veloso, a congressman in the central Philippines who was named by the president, said on Friday he would sue the government for including him on the list. He said that Mr. Duterte’s list was not thoroughly vetted, and said he welcomed an investigation. “I will go straight to the point: This is politics,” Mr. Veloso, a former judge, said over local radio, but stressed he had no quarrel with Mr. Duterte. Neri Colmenares, a lawyer and former congressman now running for the Senate, accused Mr. Duterte of releasing the list in order to terrorize his political opponents. Mr. Colmenares is part of a lawyers’ group representing relatives of several people killed in the drug war. The government “should file criminal cases so that those in the list can be imprisoned,” he said. “But exposing the list even if the evidence is still weak only warns the real culprits and makes it difficult to gather evidence.” The Catholic Church has also been a critic of Mr. Duterte’s drug war, and several bishops have recently come out in public saying that they received death threats from unknown sources. While Mr. Duterte has called on the police to protect the priests, on Thursday night he said he did not care if they died. “You should actually be shot,” he said, using an epithet to refer to priests. Carlos Conde, the Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch, said Friday that the president’s outburst was “an outrageous attempt to influence local elections in May.” “More critically, it’s a veritable hit list in his drug war, as past politicians accused of drug involvement all too often end up being shot dead by police,” Mr. Conde said, adding that those in the list had been deprived of due process and presumption of innocence. “This weaponizing of the drug war against politicians further undermines the rule of law, democracy and civil liberties in the Philippines,” he said.<|im_end|>

# Sean Payton dislikes playoff all-star officiating crews

Don't count New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton as a fan of all-star officiating crews for the postseason.  Payton's team was victimized by a blatant missed call, which even the league admitted should have drawn a penalty, that contributed to a 26-23 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game.  And the Saints head coach told NFL Network's Steve Wyche over the weekend at the league's annual meeting in Phoenix that matchups need to better officiated, especially if the top officials in the league are on the field.   LATEST ANALYSIS ▶ Battista: Gronk retires on high note ▶ Russell Wilson's contract conundrum ▶ Annual League Meeting primer ▶ FA beneficiaries: Who got most help? ▶ Zierlein mock: NYG reload at WR, QB ▶ Grading 2019's NFL trades ▶ Power Rankings: 1-32 after FA ▶ Notable FA additions for each team ▶ Top 101 free agents  "We can't have an all-star crew and sit there and stare at a play like that," Payton said. "That honestly is called correctly -- not only in high school Friday night -- that call is made correctly in youth football. This is supposedly our best and our best wasn't good enough."  Payton, a member of the league's competition committee, then expounded on why he doesn't favor the all-star format for the playoffs.  "The first time I meet you and we've never met before and we're going to golf together, we're probably, both of us, are going to be, I would say, very cordial and it's human nature to get along with each other," Payton told Wyche. "But if you and I play every Friday, then it would be very common eventually, as I get to know you to talk a little smack, maybe, or certainly feel comfortable to act the way I normally would act.  "I think when you take those officials -- and those crews are together and together and together and together -- and all of a sudden the postseason comes and we split them up into an all-star crew in that play, if you look closely, you'll watch a young official acquiesce to the veteran official and not want to overstep his bounds."  Human nature aside, the Saints' head coach raises a legitimate concern if younger officials are deferring to their older counterparts, especially when considering the primary goal should surround getting the call right regardless of experience level.  Payton ultimately wants to see improvement in officiating and more full-time opportunities for members of the striped community.  "Our best at playing and our best at coaching are spending 20 hours, 18 hours a day," he said. "Our best at officiating, it's their second job. You know, it's the only sport. That has to change like that because it's too hard. There's too much at stake for someone who's a teacher at a school, who's a florist, an attorney. That's backward thinking."  The NFL employed 24 full-time officials in 2018, an increase from 21 the previous season.  Of the seven officials on the field in the NFC Championship Game, only two were on a full-time status: line judge Rusty Barnes and field judge Tom Hill. The two officials closest to the controversial play were down judge Patrick Turner and side judge Gary Cavaletto.<|im_end|>

# 5 Digital Marketing Strategies for Restaurants

Restaurants are some of the businesses that benefit the most from a targeted and precise digital marketing strategy. This is especially important considering that most restaurants are locally based and rely on customer footfall to generate revenue. If you’re struggling to make your marketing strategies as delicious as your food, here are the best ways to advertise your restaurant online. Hire a Digital Marketing Agency Digital campaigns can be difficult to get right, especially if you have a lot of plates to balance at once. Restaurants have many different aspects to think about, and you may find that you don’t have the time necessary to create an excellent campaign. In this case, you should consider hiring a professional digital marketing agency. DMG can do all the hard work for you. They conduct research into your target audience and create tantalizing marketing campaigns across multiple platforms, from your website to your social media. This will ensure you can focus on making your restaurant’s food taste as good as it looks online. Perfect Your Local SEO A large part of any restaurant’s revenue is spontaneous business from local visitors to the area. So it’s important to perfect your local SEO. This will ensure visitors conducting searches in your area are able to find your business among the competition fighting for their stomachs. To implement local SEO, you should use keywords that contain your location, and you should place these keywords in your headings and on your homepage. You should also ensure all your online profiles have the correct location and contact information. Make Your Dishes Instagram Worthy It is important to establish a good social media presence as a business. However, you have an advantage if you are a restaurant. Food blogs and social media accounts are increasingly popular, and not a minute goes by when someone on your “friends” list doesn’t publish a photo of an aesthetically pleasing dish. To establish your business’s social media presence, you should first ensure your food looks good in a photo. Next, you should set up an Instagram account and advertise this to your customers, suggesting they tag you in their photos. Run Promotions and Competitions No one can turn down a free meal or drink. You can run promotions and competitions on your social media accounts. Good criteria for these include asking people to share your page or the post as an entry condition or offering a free drink when someone tags you or adds your location. This will broaden your reach and allow more people to engage with your business, as well as increase your online following. Get Foodies to Post Reviews People love to review food, and you shouldn’t be shy about asking them for reviews. Reviews can benefit your Google ranking by showing your business is reliable and increasing your authority. Reviews also advertise your trustworthiness to other customers, and new customers will be more likely to come to your business if they’re already assured the food is good. You can gain reviews by providing links on receipts, creating a review page on your website, or running an email newsletter, through which you can contact people after they have eaten with you. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Name * Email * Website Join the Informer mailing list Check your email and confirm the subscription<|im_end|>

# Jack Ross on getting the best out of Sunderland’s Will Grigg and whether Luke O’Nien could be the answer

Jack Ross has no concerns over Will Grigg after a testing week on the road.  Grigg’s goal in the Checkatrade Trophy semi final at Bristol Rovers was his first from open play since making the deadline day switch from Wigan Athletic, but he has been starved of service in the following two games. That has led to plenty of debate about how best the Black Cats can get support to him and generate more scoring chances for him. With injuries to a number of forward players, it is something Ross is weighing up but he was eager not to get carried away, particularly after the wretched conditions that blighted the 0-0 draw with Barnsley at Oakwell. “In general I’ve been pleased with how he’s played,” he said. “On Tuesday, it was maybe one of his quieter games since he came to the club. “It wasn’t an easy game to play in, particularly for a striker to deal with balls that were either underhit or overhit because of the wind. “It wasn’t an ideal night for him but his contribution in league games has been good. “Probably with the exception of Tuesday, he’s had opportunities in every game. “I’ve no worries with his abilities to take the chances when they come along. “In football there is a lot of short-termism but I do think here the range of emotions, it can be wild at times,” he added. “Tuesday evening for me, the conditions were utterly dreadful to play in. “It’s not a game where you judge any player properly. “If I was watching a game as an opposition scout and looking at a player to sign, it’s pointless. “It was just a tough, tough night, about guts and character. “You have to judge it on a run of games and with Will, the opportunities we have created have been pretty high and he’s been in and around that.” Clearly, though, Ross has a decision to make about the blend of his side. George Honeyman, Chris Maguire and Duncan Watmore are all unavailable, players who would naturally get in support of Grigg. “Generally we start every game with three attacking players on the pitch,” Ross said. “I said that a few weeks ago when there was a clamour to play with two strikers. We did that against Accrington and didn’t play well. “We play with two out-and-out wide players, not every team does that. Some do, but some play with ones who are more of a midfielder. “The ones we are missing at the moment are ones who can play in an around the striker. “It is unfortunate to have them available because that would undoubtedly help us.” So could the answer be Luke O’Nien? Many think so, particularly now that the return of Reece James could allow Adam Matthews to play on his stronger side. Ross admits he has considered it but strongly hinted that we would rather keep him at full back. “One, we are restricted a little bit in terms of the numbers that can play there,” Ross said. “But he’s also been voted player of the month twice at full back. “I think he’s still got a lot to learn in that midfield role and we’ve seen that in some of the games. “I’ve never really pigeonholed him. “Even on Tuesday, I thought he did well defensively against one of their best players, [Mamadou] Thiam is a real handful to play against,” Ross added. “He competed really well. “At the moment, it’s something we’re considering because of our limited options. “It did go through my head during the game itself but then you’re making a lot of changes to a back four that was doing well in the game.”<|im_end|>

# Hidden costs of nation’s healthcare - Taipei Times

On Feb. 18, US college student Kevin Bozeat wrote a Facebook post titled “The horrors of socialized medicine: A first-hand experience” in which he described seeking medical treatment in Taiwan. Bozeat stressed that Taiwan provides high-quality care, but charges low fees. Bozeat’s post has been shared more than 200,000 times on Facebook and was even reported by mainstream US news media, including the Washington Post. Some of the reports say that the US would do well to learn from the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme. While many think Taiwan should be proud of the NHI, people should also consider who is sacrificed for such a glorious achievement and the effect that cheap medical fees might have on its international image. In describing the treatment he received at National Taiwan University Hospital’s Department of Emergency Medicine, Bozeat wrote that he received the best treatment available in Taiwan for only US$80. He was amazed by the short waiting time, and the medical and communication skills of the doctors and nurses. The same care in the US would probably cost many times more, he wrote. Bozeat probably does not know the real reason Taiwan’s healthcare system can provide such affordable treatment: It places unreasonable limits on medical fees and personnel costs. Excessive suppression of personnel costs leads to widespread problems of long work hours for doctors and nurses. Although a new doctor can earn an annual salary of NT$1 million (US$32,361), higher than many other professions, it is still nowhere near as high as the starting salary for doctors in Western countries who meet comparable standards. The healthcare system also makes no clear distinction between the fees charged to insured and uninsured people. Even for foreigners who are not enrolled in the NHI program, hospitals and clinics can at most increase their fees by a proportion relative to the standard NHI reimbursement, while standard NHI reimbursements are minimized to begin with.  Low salaries for doctors and nurses, and unreasonable price controls, create what many foreigners see as Taiwan’s “healthcare miracle.” This situation sacrifices the respect that doctors and nurses ought to enjoy, while using tax funds to subsidize prices. If this is a Taiwanese miracle, is it one to be proud of? When US mainstream media reprinted Bozeat’s post and told readers about Taiwan’s cheap medical fees, many reacted with amazement. For the vast majority of Americans who do not know much about Taiwan, this kind of reporting could give them the impression that this is a relatively backward nation. In capitalist nations such as the US, low prices generally indicate substandard quality. Social psychology experiments have even shown that if a product has a cheaper price tag, US consumers doubt its quality. Americans could react in a similar way if they picture another nation’s quality of healthcare based on US costs, without having experienced it. Although Taiwanese are proud of the quality of medical treatment here, the price could give Americans a completely different impression. Taiwan has always wanted to get closer to Western nations. It could do so by wielding its soft power on the international stage. If Taiwanese want to be friends with Western nations on a basis of mutual respect, they must work hard to alter the image that they are proud of low prices.<|im_end|>

# Aissata Traore scores first career hat-trick as Besiktas crush Fatih Vatanspor | Goal.com

Aissata Traore scored her first career hat-trick in Besiktas's 8-1 thrashing of Fatih Vatanspor in Sunday's Turkish Bayanlar Ligi fixture.  The Malian international joined the Istanbul-based outfit from Malian side Super Lionness on a season-long loan deal in February and has been impressive since her arrival in Turkey.  After a 3-1 defeat at ALG Spor, Mutlucan Zavotcu's ladies returned to winning ways as they thrashed their visitors at the Beşiktaş Municipality Ismet Inonu Stadium.  A hat-trick from Traore plus strikes from Emine Ece Esen, Arzu Karabulut, Gizem Gonultas, Ayse Sevval and Gamze Kocer ensured the hosts earned their 14th win this season.  The Malian now boasts of four goals and three assists in five appearances for the Black and Whites.  With the triumph, Besiktas remain on top with 33 points from 15 games - tied on points with Konak Belediyespor but seperated on goals difference.  They will hope to keep their title dreams alive when they face Amedspor in their next league fixture on April 12, 2019.<|im_end|>

For the second year in a row, OUR CITY coalition will host a “State of OUR CITY” that will highlight a number of the group’s identified problematic issues that Buffalo still faces. The OUR CITY public event, held at Asbury Hall on Delaware Avenue on Wednesday, March 27, from 6:30pm to 8:30pm, will broach the topics of gentrification, the affordable housing crisis, food and health equity, energy democracy, over-policing of Black and Brown communities, lack of safe, reliable, and affordable transit, and the lack of oversight and investment in public education.

# MSU's Suzy Merchant, CMU's Presley Hudson share mutual respect

South Bend, Ind. — Suzy Merchant was a floor general for the Central Michigan women’s basketball team from 1987-91, dishing out a program-record 463 assists. Merchant owned that record for 28 years. Then, a basketball player from little old Wayland, Mich., came to Mount Pleasant and took it away as a senior last Nov. 12. In a cruel twist, however, it was Merchant, the 12th-year Michigan State head coach, who put an end to new record-holder Presley Hudson’s collegiate career over the weekend in the NCAA Tournament. Hudson, after an 88-87 loss to Michigan State, finished her four-year Central Michigan career with 643 assists. “I don’t even feel like she stole it, she blew it out of the water,” Merchant said. “She is a remarkable kid and a talent. I remember when she broke it, I sent her a nice tweet, because that’s an old record for sure.” Walking off the court Saturday was a tear-filled Hudson. Along with breaking the assist record, she set the program's all-time scoring record with 2,309 points. (More than any men's player, too.) Hudson’s ability to score the basketball stood out most to Merchant. “I don’t think I scored 2,000 points going back to when I started playing basketball in fourth grade,” Merchant said. “Not only does she score the ball, she makes other people better.” Hudson, of course, was a central focal point for Michigan State's defense. Still, the 5-foot-6 guard still scored 20 points, including a key 3-point late in the game. She was 8-for-14 shooting, and had seven rebounds and five assists in the loss. Watching Hudson reminded Merchant of her days as a Chippewa, which was something that once tested her as a youthful coach. “I have a lot of respect for her,” Hudson said before the game. “She's a great coach." Merchant was head coach at Eastern Michigan for nine seasons before coming to East Lansing. Since the Eagles play in the Mid-American Conference, she made at least one trip per year to Mount Pleasant to coach against her alma mater. Those games were some of the toughest events in Merchant’s field of work. “What was harder, when I was coaching there, was walking into that arena where I spent four years at,” she said. “Coaching against them a couple times a year, that’s had a different kind of feel. I was thankful that I had the opportunity to be at Eastern Michigan, so I knew what it was like to go against my alma mater.” Saturday's game was the first time Michigan State and Central Michigan had played in Merchant's tenure. It also was the first time they played in Central Michigan coach Sue Guevara's tenure in Mount Pleasant. Guevara is a former Michigan State assistant. After the game, Merchant said her concern with playing Central had nothing to do with her old school, rather everything to do with Guevara’s success. “Our kids had the utmost respect for them,” Merchant said of the Chippewas, who, led by Hudson and Reyna Frost, made back-to-back NCAA Tournaments, including an historic run to the Sweet 16 a year ago. “We felt it was a huge game for us” When Guevara and Merchant shook hands following Michigan State's win, Guevara had a question for Merchant. “You sure you don’t want to do this more often?” “Not a chance."

# Salpointe, Tucson high use theater to address tough issues

Two Tucson high schools are taking the stage to address tough social issues. Salpointe Catholic High School examines gun violence with the play “Bang Bang You’re Dead,” and Tucson Magnet High School presents “Our Border Town,” an original piece about immigration. School shootings and immigration are issues many high school students grapple with daily. Theater can be a healthy way to deal with these complex social problems, said Noshene Ranjbar, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. “Children have even less control over their lives than adults, so when they see injustices around them, their nervous system can react even more strongly,” Ranjbar said. Outlets such as art and advocacy are some of the best ways to cope with stressful situations and emotions, she added. “Practicing speaking up, advocating and taking action is a learned behavior,” she said. “When early in their lives they don’t have the opportunity to speak up, be heard, or express emotions in healthy ways, it is harder to learn to do so as adults.” By tackling the issue of gun violence with “Bang Bang You’re Dead,” Salpointe theater teacher Ericka Quintero hopes to be able to provide support for her students. “I really felt that reaching out and using education to help support my school was important, and the best way I know how to do that is to contribute through theater,” said Quintero. “And the kids were so excited to be a part of creating this awareness.” The play, by William Mastrosimone, addresses gun violence in schools as well as mental-health issues. It premiered in 1999 and is based on a school shooting that occurred in May 1998 at Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon, where a student shot and killed his parents, two students and wounded 25 others. Along with Mastrosimone, the play was written by survivors of the shooting and performed for the first time at Thurston High School. Salpointe is also participating in a nationwide campaign called “See/Hear Something, Say Something,” featuring open conversations about gun violence and encouraging students to speak up when they see or hear something suspicious or questionable. According to Quintero, the shooters say a lot in the majority of school shootings, but nothing is ever reported. “The school is working hard to raise awareness that we need to become vocal advocates for one another. We want to help our students see that they have power,” said Dana Milne, Salpointe’s artistic director. The students involved in the production of “Bang Bang You’re Dead” say they are thankful for the opportunity to speak up about this issue and hope they can make an impact on their school and community. “I feel like a lot of things in this show hit home because some of these things are preventable,” said Sophie Smith, a senior who plays the shooter’s mother. “The concept of mental illness is also a big factor in this, and it gets a discussion going about reaching out to people who are mentally ill so they don’t get to that dangerous place.” Tommie Irish, a sophomore who plays the shooter, discussed the emotional toll that this type of production can have on young actors and how he prepares for his performance. “I have to imagine myself as someone with a mental illness and I have to really think about hearing voices in my head and take into consideration what really goes into somebody doing such a drastic, violent thing,” he said. “Because it’s not as simple as just bringing a gun to school one day. It’s kind of a buildup of things. So I have to have that understanding.” By using theater to open a conversation about gun violence in the community, Salpointe students said they hope to help create nationwide change. “I definitely have a fear that this could happen to me, especially after the Parkland (Florida) shooting happened, because it was very publicized and there were actual videos from the shooting. It felt like this could really happen to us,” Smith said. “Our Border town” Students at Tucson High are tackling another relevant social issue with the premiere of “Our Border Town,” an original play by Amy Almquist. With 45 cast and crew members, the documentary-style play is based on interviews with members of the Tucson community, including migrants, Border Patrol agents, humanitarians, undocumented students and militia leaders, all with different perspectives on the border issue. “I want people to see that everyone has a story and everyone has a perspective that is born out of their own personal experience,” Almquist said. “And when we can see other people’s stories, whether we agree with them or not, we can develop a level of compassion.” Her husband, Art Almquist, and Julian Martinez, both drama teachers at Tucson High, said the project attempts to humanize the border issue and dive beyond political affiliation. “One of the goals of this play is to get the human perspective back on this border crisis and to create empathy for the humans that are involved, as opposed to how much strife and stress and conflict that the politics behind it cause,” Martinez said. Art Almquist said students were immediately engaged with the idea of taking on such a controversial topic and felt strongly about telling the stories . “One of my favorite moments was in my advanced drama class in December, and Amy wanted to hear the play read out loud right after she had finished it,” he said. “We read it out loud and by the end of it, everyone was in tears. It was just extraordinary to be a part of that and see how excited they were to do this.” For sophomore Sharlyn Zavala, who plays a 42-year-old Bolivian immigrant, students should be at the forefront of these difficult conversations. “As the prodigies of many immigrants, it makes us feel like we have a voice and like we are doing something to help these stories be heard,” Zavala said. Because the play doesn’t focus on a single perspective, the students said they also had to open their minds and be vulnerable on stage and that the border issue is not simply black and white. “I think the play is really powerful,” said freshman Ella Bracale, who plays 78-year-old Rev. John Fife, a retired minister, founder of the Tucson Samaritans and co-founder of the Sanctuary Movement. “It’s important that we as a school get to talk about this big issue, and it’s so beautifully written in the fact that it does not lean to one side, it’s not bashing the viewer, it’s not saying ‘your view is wrong and you have to feel guilty,’” she said . “It’s so important for students to be aware of what’s going on, and I think using art and theatre makes it really approachable,” said Tucson High sophomore Rosie Nuccio. “People who are making decisions need to know that students care about this and that this is important to us.”<|im_end|>

# Google To Scale Back Tablet And Notebook Production | eTeknix

Google To Scale Back Tablet And Notebook Production Mike Sanders / 7 hours ago Google Scaling Back Tablet & Notebooks Despite Google being a relatively new company in the tech world, that hasn’t stopped them expanding and  It seems, however, that their attempt to break into the world of tablets and notebooks has hit a snag. In a report via Techpowerup, Google has announced that it is applying some significant ‘scaling back’ to its Pixelbook and Pixel Slate development. Jobs Lost In the report, it is indicated that Google has terminated a significant number of jobs within the R&D aspect of their tablet and notebook design. At the time of writing the exact number isn’t clear. The company, however, must clearly believe that this is one area that they may not be able to crack. In fairness, there is a lot of competition in this market. Has Google finally failed to get a slice of the pie? – Probably! What Do We Think? If you were let down the hyperbole road, you could think that Google might be set to effective cut their Pixelbook/Slate loose. What is clear is that despite their operating system being very popular, however, less expensive alternatives (largely Chinese) have been able to pretty much sew up the low to mid-end market in recent years. If you were, however, considering purchasing a Google notebook or tablet, you might be well advised to hold fire. At least for the moment until it’s clear what the company plans for the future. What do you think? – Let us know in the comments!<|im_end|>

# Paul Haggis drops lawsuit against publicist over sex allegations

NEWS COMPETITION Filmmaker Paul Haggis has dropped the lawsuit he filed against the woman who accused him of sexual assault. The Crash director filed paperwork against Haleigh Breest in 2017 before she came forward with claims of "gender violence" against the Brit, claiming he had been approached by her lawyer demanding $9,000 (£6,800). His case was dismissed last summer (18) and he filed an appeal, which he has now dropped, according to The Blast. According to court documents obtained by the outlet, Haggis is planning to continue his fight against the separate civil lawsuit his accuser filed against him. A statement from Breest’s attorney, Ilann M. Maazel, reads: "Mr. Haggis’ lawsuit against Haleigh Breest was a disgrace. It was in our view an attempt to silence and intimidate Ms. Breest, and it failed. Mr. Haggis should never have sued Ms. Breest in the first place, and we are pleased that he finally gave up." In her civil suit against the Oscar winner, Breest claimed Haggis forced her to pleasure him orally. The writer/director revealed he received oral sex from the publicist, but there was no rape involved, stating: "All sexual activity and interactions between the parties were consensual." In her lawsuit, Breest also claimed she and Haggis had vaginal sex, but the Crash director has denied this. He has also denied claims he forced the publicist to drink alcohol, and her allegations she lost consciousness. The filmmaker supported his argument that he's no sexual predator and respects women by including written testimonies signed by his female housekeeper and assistant.<|im_end|>

# Slammers women opener: Round one win the key

Printsync South West Slammers women’s coach Nathan Grover believes a round one SBL victory over the East Perth Eagles on Saturday night at the Eaton Recreation Centre may bode well for a winning season and subsequent finals appearance. “This is very much a confidence-based group of girls,” he said. “I know the past couple of years we have gone 0-4 before getting our first win on the board. “So getting a win first up would be massive for the team. “We have a bye the week after, which will give us a little bit more time to work on things even further.” Grover was impressed with how Ebony Bilcich and Cian Parsons applied themselves during the Bunbury Basketball Association A-Women grand final for Tornadoes Black, with Bilcich recognised following the match as the association’s women’s MVP for 2018-19. “They are probably the two players I can rely on more than anyone to go out, work hard and fight it out every game,” he said. “If it is for five minutes or 15 to 20 minutes – I know those two will give their absolute all. “It’s pretty heartening to know that you have girls in the squad and coming off the bench, giving 110 per cent straight away.” Four of Grover’s squad – Bilcich, Parsons, Kate Fielding and Adele East – received BBA A-Women’s All Star selections and the Slammers boss feels this good form could carry over into the opening few games. “To have four as All-Stars is pretty amazing,” he said. “I gotta say, I’m pretty proud of Ebony as well because it will do the world of good for her confidence.” The Eagles endured a tough season in 2018, finishing 0-22 on the bottom of the ladder – however they performed well at the 2019 SBL Pre-Season Blitz, winning two games from three outings.

# Sanders Says Up To Barr To Release Report | Mix 106.9

(AP) – White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders says President Donald Trump will let the attorney general decide whether the special counsel’s Russia report should be publicly released, though she adds that “he’s more than happy for any of this stuff to come out.”  Sanders spoke to NBC’s “Today” show Monday as White House aides and allies blanketed television news broadcasts to trumpet a summary of the report that said that Robert Mueller did not find evidence that Trump’s campaign “conspired or coordinated” with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.  Asked last week about publicly releasing the report, Trump said: “Let it come out. Let people see it. That’s up to the attorney general.”  Asked whether Trump would support release of the report, Sanders told NBC, “I don’t think the president has any problem with it,” but stressed the decision was up to Attorney General William Barr.  Barr issued a four page summary of Mueller’s findings Sunday. Democrats are demanding the full report.<|im_end|>

# Alma Geraldine Koen

PARK HILLS -- Alma Geraldine Koen, age 90, passed away March 14, 2019, at Southwest Christian Care Hospice in Union City, Georgia. She was born April 1, 1928, in Bonne Terre, Missouri. Geraldine was a member of Esther Baptist Church and retired from Central RIII School System in Park Hills, Missouri, where she worked as a secretary for 34 years. Among her family and friends, Geraldine was famous for her pie-making skills. She believed that the crust was the most important part of a pie, and she always prepared her piecrusts from scratch using her mother’s recipe. Family members could count on her to make their favorite pies, often with gooseberries or rhubarb from her garden. When her family or friends were sick, she often prepared custard pies to speed them on to recovery. Geraldine was preceded in death by her parents, John Louis and Hulda Alice (Patterson) Waller; her husband of 59 years, Charles F. Koen; two sisters, Elizabeth (Waller) Byington and Mary Alice (Waller) Bridges; and two brothers, Glenwood Waller and John Ferrel (Jake) Waller. Surviving Geraldine are two children, John Charles Koen and wife Beulah of Auburn, Illinois, and Debra Kaye (Koen) Huff and husband Nick of Newnan, Georgia; four grandchildren; nine great-grandchildren; and numerous nieces, nephews, other relatives and friends. Visitation will be 10 a.m. Wednesday, March 20, 2019, at Horton Wampler Funeral Home in Park Hills, Missouri. A funeral service will follow at 11 a.m. in the chapel with Rev. Todd Buck officiating. Interment at St. Francois Memorial Park. The family would like to express gratitude to the caregivers and hospice staff at Christian City, Sparks Inn Assisted Living and Southwest Christian Care Hospice both in Union City, Georgia. Thank you for caring so well for our mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother during her stay with you. Your kindness will always be remembered.

Before dawn on Saturday mornings, inside Cathedral of Hope in Dallas, the non-profit Dallas Hope Charities transforms a place of worship into a restaurant. "It's an amazing thing to see this in action," said volunteer and board member Jason Reed. Around 40 volunteers are preparing to serve around 250 people in need — some even facing homelessness. "You want to head toward the front of the room? A gentleman will seat you," Reed said as people started to walk in after the doors opened at 7:30 a.m. "We serve our guests here like a restaurant with a hot breakfast," Reed said. "We have waiters and waitresses that serve and our mission really is provide a level of kindness and respect and dignity to our guests that they won't find anywhere else." Guests are waited on by attentive volunteers, like Khirstian Satcher. "Ya, giving them some breakfast, helping them start their day in a positive way," Satcher said. She is volunteering alongside her sorority sisters. Together, they are delivering plates of food with side orders of joy and kindness. "They treat us very nice. You do not feel like you're less than anything," Christopher Alexander said while taking a break from eating. "You feel like somebody cares about you." A breakfast regular is Joshua Lloyd. "Oh, I like it. The people are nice, and they care about people," Lloyd said. He said he can tell they care because they offer health screenings with doctors at no cost. Also in the lobby, volunteers give free haircuts. It's a way for them to give and also get back. "One guy told me, 'you know, I'm gonna have a good day because of you.' And I said, 'I'm gonna have a good day because of you!' That really makes me feel good," Satcher said. "I view this as a time for me personally to kind of step back from thinking about myself and my own problems and to really focus on serving other people," Reed said. Dallas Hope Charities is connecting with people over breakfast, bringing smiles and friendship to folks every Saturday morning. "Never missed one in 11 years," Reed told a man who was leaving after eating. "Thank you for coming in. I hope to see you next week!" Dallas Hope Charities is able to help people because of donations, which are running low. If you'd like to help support their efforts, here is a link to their website: dallashopecharities.org.<|im_end|>

# Shadow candidate to utilise political parties Law during campaign; Road to Malawi's May 21 polls - The Maravi Post

One of President Peter Mutharika’s aides, Gerald Viora with supporters    By Elijah Phompho, MEC Stringer    One of President Peter Mutharika’s aides, Gerald Viora who is now competing as Member of Parliament for Chikwawa South Constituency says he will utilise the newly passed Political Parties Act to campaign for his candidature in Chikwawa South Constituency.    Speaking on Sunday when he launched his Campaign at Mphonde football ground in group village head man Mphonde in the area of traditional authority (T/A) mgabu in Chikwawa, Viora said the act has given equal footage for all candidates to campaign unlike in the past when candidates who were not giving handouts were being disadvantaged.    His sentiments come amid reports that some candidates continue giving money during performances at political rallies. The electorates are also yet to get used to vote for a candidate not because they have been giving out money but based on policies.    “What used to happen in the past was that the electorates were being turned into beggars. I have taken up the challenge of civic educating them that they don’t need to be beggars to their leaders. I will make sure that I shall empower the people of this constituency economically once I become the MP for this area. Time for electorates to cue for money at a Member of Parliament’s house has gone.    I want to applaud government for coming up with this law because now the competition is going to be based on development agendas and I challenge my competitors that we face each other on the ground with our development agendas,” Viola said.    Section 41(1) of the Political Parties Act prohibits candidates or political parties contesting in an election from issuing hand outs during campaign and failure to adhere to the law attracts a penalty of 10 million kwacha fine or a five years jail sentence.    But when asked if the candidates are to abide by the law during this campaign period, political analyst Rafik Hajat said the implementation of the law requires enough voter civic education to the electorates and hence it may take a long time if the law is to be fully implemented.    However, the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) continues to warn candidates that it shall take necessary measures to all candidates that shall be giving handouts during campaign rallies.    In his campaign Viola is advancing a change in what he called politics of slavery where electorates get used to hand outs from their leaders. Viola said he intends to promote politics of independence where electorates are empowered economically.    Among other development projects, Viola said he intends to make sure that the constituency has a government hospital, conventional secondary school and good roads which he said previous leaders failed to implement.    Viola is competing against the deputy director of research in the main opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) Eliyas Karim and other independent candidates.<|im_end|>

# Compared to sustained inflations for extremely premature infants, standard treatment prevails

Preterm infants must establish regular breathing patterns at delivery. For extremely preterm infants requiring resuscitation at birth, a ventilation strategy involving two sustained inflations, compared with standard intermittent positive pressure ventilation, did not reduce the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.  Researchers compared the two methods in a large, multicenter trial led by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The findings were published in the March 26, 2019 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association.  Studies comparing the two methods have been limited thus far. Pooled data from smaller randomized trials were conflicting: one showed that sustained inflations reduced the need for mechanical ventilation. However, another found no benefit in mortality. In infants younger than 30 weeks gestational age, sustained inflations are commonly used in delivery rooms in Europe, but not in the United States.  "Preterm infants with weak respiratory muscles and liquid-filled lungs struggle to aerate their lungs, leaving them at risk of complications, including Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), which is associated with a lot of long-term problems," said Haresh Kirpalani, MD, MSc, neonatologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the study's lead author. "We hypothesized that establishing adequate lung volume quickly in these infants could reduce the risk of BPD. This was possible using sustained inflations at delivery, as these appeared beneficial in animal models, and in smaller prior human studies. However, in our larger randomized trial, in the smallest and most vulnerable preterm infants, this proved not to be the case."  The randomized trial was conducted from August 2014 to September 2017, in 18 neonatal intensive care units in nine countries. Preterm infants from 23 to 26 weeks gestational age requiring resuscitation with inadequate respiratory effort or bradycardia were enrolled. The primary outcome was the rate of BPD or death at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. There were 27 prespecified secondary efficacy outcomes and seven safety outcomes, including death at less than 48 hours.  Among 460 infants randomized (mean gestational age, 25.30 weeks; 50.2 percent female), 426 infants (92.6 percent) completed the trial. In the sustained inflation group, 137 infants (63.7 percent) died or survived with BPD as compared to 125 infants (59.2 percent) in the standard resuscitation group. Death at less than 48 hours of age occurred in 16 infants (7.4 percent) in the sustained inflation group compared with 3 infants (1.4 percent) in the standard resuscitation group. Of 27 secondary efficacy outcomes assessed by 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, 26 showed no significant difference between groups.  "Because we had been worried about complications, the external data safety monitoring board was looking for early adverse events. Unfortunately, this promising therapy seemed to have higher mortality, especially in the smallest, most vulnerable infants," added Kirpalani. "Additional research is needed to address how best to treat these infants at delivery, to reduce their risk of extreme side effects of a very early birth."  ###  Haresh Kirpalani, BM, MSc, et al. for the SAIL Site Investigators. Effect of Sustained Inflations vs Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation on Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia or Death Among Extremely Preterm Infants: The SAIL Randomized Clinical Trial. JAMA. 2019;321(12):1165-1175. doi:10.1001/jama.2019.1660 About Children's Hospital of Philadelphia: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was founded in 1855 as the nation's first pediatric hospital.

# Apple Says Spotify Wants Benefits of a Free App Without Being Free

Apple Says Spotify Wants Benefits of a Free App Without Being Free  Spotify, launched a year after Apple unveiled its first iPhone in 2007, said the company unfairly limits rivals to its own music streaming service.  Apple Says Spotify Wants Benefits of a Free App Without Being Free (Image: Reuters Pictures).  Loading...     
	Apple Inc on Thursday responded to Spotify Technology SA's complaint with EU antitrust regulators, saying the audio streaming service "wants all the benefits of a free app without being free". Spotify, launched a year after Apple unveiled its first iPhone in 2007, said on Wednesday the company unfairly limits rivals to its own music streaming service.  Apple's control of its App Store deprived consumers of choice and rival providers of audio streaming services to the benefit of Apple Music, which began in 2015, Spotify added. In response, Apple said it had approved and distributed nearly 200 app updates on Spotify's behalf, resulting in over 300 million downloaded copies of the Spotify app. 
			 "The only time we have requested adjustments is when Spotify has tried to sidestep the same rules that every other app follows," Apple said in a statement. "Spotify is free to build apps for - and compete on - our products and platforms, and we hope they do," it added. The Swedish company has launched a website, outlining different ways in which Apple uses its power to make its platform an "uneven playing field."  In its reply, Apple has rebutted most of the points made by Spotify on the website, "Time to Play Fair". The company had also said Apple's voice recognition system Siri would not let iPhone users play music from Spotify and that Apple had declined to let Spotify launch an app on its smartwatch. The Cupertino, California-based company responded by saying that when it reached out to Spotify about Siri and AirPlay 2 support on several occasions, the Swedish company had said that they were working on it. Spotify was not immediately available to comment on Apple's response.

# Update: Soulja Boy Released After Brief Arrest

Update: Soulja Boy Released From Jail, Says He’s Not Going Out "Like 6ix9ine"  Police reportedly discovered firearms and ammo in his possession.  Update: 12:00 am ET (March 16, 2019) — Soulja Boy was released from custody hours after being arrested on Friday (March 15).  The 28-year-old rapper took to Instagram Live with a rant about getting out of jail and having the “biggest comeback” of 2018. “I'm not goin' out like 6ix9ine, you got me f**ed up, bruh,” he added.  Soulja was freed from jail in time to make his scheduled performance at the Los Angeles Clippers Game.  Original story below…  ---  According to reports, Soulja was on his way to meet up with his probation officer in San Fernando Valley when he was detained by police. He is currently sitting in jail in Van Nuys, a neighborhood in Los Angeles.  The "Pretty Boy Swag" artist's latest arrest is reportedly a violation of his probation. The rapper is currently on probation stemming from his weapons conviction dating back eight years. In 2016, Soulja added more time to his probation sentence after cops discovered at least one weapon in his home, which violated the judge's strict "no weapons" policy.  Apparently, Soulja Boy was not paying attention. Moving on to Feb. 2019, police raided the rapper's home after a woman claimed he held her hostage in his garage. During the raid, police discovered more ammunition and firearms.  Soulja Boy was supposed to perform at the Los Angeles Clippers game later tonight, but it's unclear if that performance is still going to happen as planned. He is expected to appear in court this Friday afternoon.<|im_end|>

# Trouble at for-profit colleges in 5 graphs: Here's what's happening

Argosy University — which once boasted 19 campuses and an online division — shuttered this month after failing to distribute millions of dollars in federal aid to students. That led the federal government to disqualify the school from the student aid programs. The for-profit school converted to nonprofit in late 2017, but still collapsed. It's the latest for-profit chain to implode in recent years. What’s happening to for-profit colleges? For-profit schools tout their flexible degree programs that offer training for practical careers like dental assisting and business administration. But while mainline colleges operate as nonprofits, meaning their income is redirected to their educational offerings, for-profit colleges are tasked with bringing in money. Those for-profit schools have poorer outcomes than other institutions. They show lower six-year graduation rates than other universities and their alumni are more likely to default on their student loans, according to the Department of Education’s most recent data. Research has shown their graduates can expect lower lifetime earnings, too. For-profit schools proliferated throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, when more schools became eligible to receive federal student aid money and their administrations ramped up their student recruitment efforts. Enrollment at two- and four-year schools topped 2 million in 2010. Since then, enrollment has fallen more than 40 percent. The Obama administration increased oversight of for-profit colleges and eventually de-authorized the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, which accredited major for-profit chains. For-profit colleges have been targets of numerous lawsuits, too, by students alleging they were misled about the education their schools offered. Those pressures have led to campus closures nationwide. Many chains are owned by holding companies that operate several schools, and the financial strain has led companies to sell off or shutter some brands. One company, the Education Corporation of America, collapsed last December, closing its Brightwood Career Institute, Brightwood College, Ecotech Institute, Golf Academy of America and Virginia College campuses. More closures could be imminent, as more than 270 for-profit schools were under federal cash monitoring as of December. That monitoring status — which can result from problems with accreditation or administration, among other issues — can presage collapse. But the most recent data from the Department of Education still finds that more than 1 million students were enrolled at degree-granting for-profit schools in 2017.<|im_end|>

# Pfaff promises: farmers’ stories will be heard

MADISON – Brad Pfaff is proud to tell people he’s “a farm kid.” His concern for farmers, farm policy and how decisions affect rural communities is something that he has carried with him through life. Now, as Secretary-designee of the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, he says he hopes that his farm background and policy experience will help him serve the farmers of Wisconsin and the rural communities of the state. Policymakers need to recognize the importance of agriculture – one in nine jobs in Wisconsin is related to agriculture, he said. “We all need to eat and there’s a lot of pride, sweat and equity that goes into everything farmers do. “I will tell their story. I will be their advocate,” he said in an interview with Wisconsin State Farmer. “I will listen and I will share. I want these stories to be told.” The state’s dairy farmers, he said, don’t just produce a raw product for the processing industry. He believes each of them is an artisan farmer – and no two are the same. “Each is different and I value that.” Asked about the hard times hitting many Wisconsin farmers with dairy farmers leaving the industry and rising levels of farm bankruptcy rates, Pfaff replied: “I will always say that I’m optimistic about Wisconsin agriculture – we have all the assets we need – climate, cows, water, genetics, processing. “And all of that is important but we also have inside of us something a machine can’t provide – pride and dedication. That can’t be duplicated or replicated,” he added. Pfaff’s parents, Ruth, and Leon, both came from farming families. He grew up going to Friday night fish fries and listening to country music on WCOW radio while studying at Melrose-Mindoro High School near La Crosse. “The farm taught me a lot, and gave me balance,” he said. “I was raised with values. The farm shaped my perspective on life.” He credits his mother for teaching him listening skills and in his new role he plans to visit farms and rural communities to hear what people are saying. “The best ideas come from there. They need to be listened to and they will be. Their thoughts will be heard.” Pfaff said his father keeps him “on the straight and narrow. He’s my best advocate and my best friend.” His parents are still on the farm and it’s a place he goes to as often as possible. He said he’s really thankful that Governor Tony Evers selected him for the post at DATCP. “I am really grateful for this opportunity. I promise to get my chores done.” Wisconsin farmers, he said, have “taken it on the chin” over the last four years but remain hardworking, resilient and optimistic. “They give it their very best.” But he knows times have been tough. The day before our interview he toured farms in several west central Wisconsin counties where heavy snow loads and high winds had destroyed barns and killed livestock and poultry. Department resources His department stands ready to help farmers. “There is a real desire in this state to farm and we have resources to help,” he said. “They might want to explore lower cost opportunities like grazing or beginning farmer programs.” The Farm Center has been a fixture in the department to help farmers with advice in many areas from financial advice to mental health. Farmers can call the Farm Center at 1-800-942-2474. There are 650 staffers at DATCP and Pfaff said he is aware of the great base of knowledge represented by those people. The department is also doing all it can to help build markets for Wisconsin products. “Farmers need all kinds of markets from local to international,” he said. Continuing the work of the previous DATCP Secretary, Sheila Harsdorf, Pfaff said the agency recently held a reverse buyers’ mission, bringing potential international buyers to Wisconsin to meet with business contacts. His agency’s International Agribusiness Center staff traveled to Dubai in February to attend the Gulfood Show and provide exhibit space to four Wisconsin companies. At that show, the DATCP team assisted the Wisconsin companies that were exhibiting, held meetings with buyers to promote Wisconsin products, and met with Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) staff. Participating companies reported projected sales of $3.3 million and actual sales of $650,000. “Sixteen percent of U.S. milk equivalent is now exported and we lead the nation in artisan cheese,” he said. “We are looking for ways to assist those cheesemakers to export their cheese to the world. People want our products.” Artisan producers He noted that Wisconsin also has a strong, historic place in the artisan meats category and he is looking for ways that his agency can do more to foster that old-world, artisan meat tradition and turn it into more markets for state products. “When you look at Wisconsin, this is value-added country,” he said. There are several programs that help DATCP forge stronger links between local customers and local farmers, including the “Buy Local-Buy Wisconsin” and Farm-to-School programs, both of which would get additional funding in Governor Tony Evers’ budget proposal. “There’s a real connection with consumers who want to know where their food comes from,” he said. The Evers budget plan would also add funding for the Dairy Processor grant program, add three new hemp project positions and add funding for a new grazing/organics program. Wisconsin has a big share of smaller, family farms that produce their products with organic standards and Pfaff said he has been watching closely what happens at the USDA with regard to national organic standards. Lack of action there is perceived by many as hurting smaller family dairy operations while helping large dairies in arid states where thousands of cows are milked. Pfaff said DATCP has its own Wisconsin Organic Advisory Council to keep officials aware of what’s happening in the organic sector – an important part of the state’s agricultural story. Pfaff congratulated Secretary Harsdorf and former Governor Scott Walker and Ray Cross at the UW-Madison for convening the Dairy Task Force 2.0 to look at policy proposals to help the state’s dairy industry. “It’s more than dollars and cents. They’re looking at rural communities, consumer trends, succession and transition of family farms and skills that are important,” he said. “More needs to be done.” As dairy farmers face the crisis that has ground on for nearly five years, Pfaff said it seems unfair that people who are producing food for the nation and the world “can hardly put food on their own table. I hear them. I recognize that and I want to be there for them. “I have no magic wand. I have been in small towns and on farms. I do get it. I think every day about our farmers. This is so much bigger than any one individual – it is our identity as a state.” Background After Pfaff graduated from Melrose-Mindoro High School, he attended the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, because it was just far enough away from home and provided a small enough environment for a country kid like him to feel comfortable. He studied public administration and business and says the examples he used in the course work were always from the farm. He later earned a Masters in Public Administration at George Mason University. He worked at the state capitol for State Representative Virgil Roberts (94th Assembly District) and then had the “tremendous opportunity” to work in agricultural policy for U.S. Senator Herb Kohl (D-WI) during the mid-1990s. At that time policy proposals they worked on included federal milk order consolidation. When U.S. Representative Ron Kind (D) was elected to the House, Pfaff got to know him and worked on agricultural policy for him. “He is extremely grounded and in touch with his district. He has a great connection to farms and rural communities.” During the Obama administration, Pfaff served for six years at the USDA’s Farm Service Agency as Wisconsin State Executive Director; he was then asked to serve as National Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs at the federal FSA office in Washington, D.C. While there he learned about farm programs in other regions of the country – from peanut growers in Georgia to wheat farmers in Kansas. “I learned from that experience that wherever they are in the nation, farmers are proud of what they produce.”<|im_end|>

# No restriction on World Cup-bound Indian players' IPL participation: Virat Kohli

Indian skipper Virat Kohli has reiterated that the World Cup-bound players need to keep watch on their workloads carefully, however, confirming that there have been no instructions to the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises to cap the number of matches each player would play throughout the tournament.  When quizzed if the IPL franchises have been asked to manage the workloads of the Indian players who are likely to take part in the showpiece event, Kohli was quick to deny the same.  "You cannot put a cap on anything. If I'm able to play 10, 12 or 15 games, it doesn't necessarily mean that the other guy can only play that many. My body might demand I play a certain number of games and I need to be smart about that and rest, "ESPNcricinfo quoted Kohli as saying.  Kohli, who was speaking during the launch of a new app for the Royal Challengers Bangalore, added, "Someone else's body might be more capable than mine or less, that is a very individual thing. And everyone wants to play the World Cup, so people will be smart about it because you don't want to miss out on such a big event."  The 30-year-old swashbuckling batsman further said that all the Indian players would take the responsibility to keep eye on their workloads and fitness during the IPL, adding that his teammates would see the T20 lucrative tournament as a chance to be in a good frame of mind ahead of the World Cup.  "And to continue the frame of mind we have created in the Indian team - strive towards excellence and improve every day. Each player will take this tournament as an opportunity to go to the World Cup in a good frame of mind," he said.  Meanwhile, former left-arm fast bowler Ashish Nehra believes that the IPL would help in keeping the players in form while a longer rest before the World Cup could make them counterproductive.  "If somebody tells Virat Kohli that you are not playing this IPL, come fresh for the World Cup, I don't think it's the right way. If he's only practicing, that practice is different [from match play]. The IPL is a pressure tournament, it is as good as international cricket, that's why everybody wants to play. So you are going to the World Cup through that pressure," Nehra said.  Stressing on the importance of active rest, Nehra further pointed out that there would be at least a three-week gap between the finals of the IPL and India's first World Cup match--something which is enough for the players.  "There's a three-week gap between the IPL final and India's first game [at the World Cup]. If you're not injured, three weeks is enough time. If someone tells me, 'You bowl in the IPL final today and then for the next three weeks you don't bowl, and then bowl straightaway against South Africa' - I would not like to do that. Active rest is very important, not just for fast bowlers but for everyone," the former bowler said.  The 2019 edition of the IPL is slated to take place from March 23 to May 19 while India are scheduled to begin their World Cup campaign against South Africa on June 5.<|im_end|>

# Gang takes 19 people from bus in northern Mexico | WTOP

MEXICO CITY (AP) — An armed gang has hauled 19 people off a passenger bus in the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas, security officials said Monday.  The gang forced the bus to stop on a highway between the border city of Reynosa and the town of San Fernando on Thursday. They abducted the victims, but allowed 22 other passengers to continue on to the border city of Reynosa, according to a state official who was not authorized to be quoted by name.  The official said the victims appear to have been Central American migrants. No relatives have come forward to file missing persons reports, suggesting the victims do not have family in Mexico. The official said the case had been turned over to federal prosecutors because it involves organized crime.  The kidnapping recalls the horrors of 2011, when dozens of passengers were hauled off buses by drug gangs in Tamaulipas, killed and their bodies dumped in mass graves.  In 2010 and 2011, the Zetas drug cartel and its rivals kidnapped both Mexican male bus passengers and hundreds of immigrants.  In those days, the bus passengers were abducted and killed because the Zetas suspected rivals gangs of moving in reinforcements aboard buses. The migrants were kidnapped either to forcibly recruit them, or to demand ransom payments from the victims’ relatives in the United States.  Migrants are still often kidnapped for that reason.

# Anning accosted at Melbourne Airport after egg attack

Anning accosted at Melbourne Airport after egg attack  Senator Fraser Anning has had a second fiery confrontation in Melbourne after having an egg cracked over his head yesterday.  Roxburgh Park's Ali Bidiri confronted Mr Anning at Melbourne Airport last night, asking whether he had "any remorse" over controversial comments in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack.  Footage posted on social media appears to show Mr Bidiri, 20, approach Mr Anning as he prepares to board a plane.  "Don't you have any remorse? don't you have any f***ing remorse?," Mr Bidiri said.  Mr Anning repeatedly tells Mr Bidiri to "stand back" before he calls him a "maggot".  Mr Bidiri told the Herald Sun that: "I met him at the airport, I was waiting to have a chat to him" as the senator boarded his flight from Melbourne to Brisbane  "I was born and raised here and to have someone that is supposed to be representing my country in the Senate to have so much hate towards people of my faith really hurts," he said.  "We all deserve to live safely  "I just felt the need to speak to him. There's no other way to directly speak to him, you can email him but can't get direct answers."  Mr Bidiri added: "He called me a maggot. To call people he is representing a maggot is pretty bad".      The confrontation came hours after Mr Anning had an egg cracked over his head by a teenager.  The 17-year-old, dubbed "egg boi", was arrested but later released pending further inquiries after egging the Senator at an event in Moorabbin yesterday afternoon.  It sparked a heated confrontation with Senator Anning and several of the Senator's supporters who jumped on the teen and tackled him to the ground.  Videos of the clash have been widely circulated online.  Footage shows the teen casually walking up behind the Senator and cracking the egg on his head while holding his camera in front of him to film the incident.  The Senator then turns around and lashes out in retaliation, slapping the boy in the head before punching him in the head.  A group of Senator Anning's supporters then pounce on the boy.  One man in a singlet grabs him in a choker hold before pinning him to the ground as others converge.  The incident happened about 3pm and by 4pm a GoFundMe page was launched for "egg boi", with money raised to cover any legal fees and to help him buy "more eggs".  Within hours the page had whisked up thousands of dollars in donations and attracted dozens of messages of support from people labelling him a legend and a hero.  The page praised him for "taking on" Senator Anning, who was "despised around the world for comments made after the shooting at a New Zealand mosque".  Victoria Police said in a statement they arrested a 17-year-old from Hampton for allegedly assaulting a 69-year-old Brisbane man by breaking an egg on his head.  "Police at the front of the venue were notified, attended and arrested the 17-year-old shortly thereafter.  "The teen was removed from the premises and his details were taken before he was released.  "The incident is being actively investigated by Victoria Police 'in its entirety' including the actions of the 69-year-old man and others."  The teen was released pending further inquiries and the investigation was ongoing, the statement said.  The event where the incident unfolded was titled "Fraser Anning speaks out on African gangs" and was attended by several far-right figures, including activist Neil Erikson.  It came one day after the widespread backlash over Senator Anning's statement where he appeared to blame Muslim immigration for the terror attacks in New Zealand where 49 people were killed.  In the statement Senator Anning said: "the real cause of the bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place".  His words were widely condemned, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison describing it as "disgusting".  "The remarks by Senator Fraser Anning blaming the murderous attacks by a violent, right-wing, extremist terrorist in New Zealand on immigration are disgusting," Morrison tweeted.  "Those views have no place in Australia, let alone the Australian parliament."  Senator Anning's statement has since been removed from his social media accounts.  Speaking to the Sunday Herald Sun today, Senator Anning said the backlash was unprecedented.  "I don't know what the backlash was all about. I condemn it [the attack in New Zealand]. I've never advocated for any violence in my life and never would. It's a disgusting act."  Senator Anning said his view hadn't changed in his career as a Senator and he made no apologies for his comments.  "Too bad if people don't like what I say then they'll just have to live with it."  He denied his words were hate speech.  "I'm just saying what a lot of people I know and people I grew up with, they believe that Muslim immigration isn't good for this country."  "Hate speech is only if anyone tells the truth - left wing class that as hate speech."  A Facebook page for the event had over 800 people listed as interested in attending.  Protesters gathered outside and walked down the street to the venue.  Many held signs and wrote messages on the pavement in chalk.  Christopher Johnson, who was with protesters from the Yelling At Racist Dogs group, said he was there to oppose the "white supremacist and anti-Muslim rhetoric".  "I was disgusted by the Senators inaugural speech and his comments after the terror attack in Christchurch yesterday," he said.  "He has stood alongside neo-Nazis and advocates policies that seek to divide Australians. The very least I could was stand opposed to him and his vile supporters."  He said the group held a peaceful protest on the nature strip outside the venue.  One message read: "Islamophobia is Terrorism".  Another said "Terrorist Sympathisers".  Meanwhile, Senator Anning will be condemned by the Senate for his comments when Federal Parliament returns next month.  Government and Opposition senators will jointly move a motion censuring Senator Anning "for his inflammatory and divisive comments seeking to attribute blame to victims of a horrific crime and to vilify people on the basis of religion".  The motion will also call on all Australians "to stand against hate and to publicly, and always, condemn actions and comments designed to incite fear and distrust".  Censure motions cannot be used to boot members from parliament, but are thought to send a strong message of condemnation and political embarrassment.<|im_end|>

# Let’s continue to resist Brexit. Our economy and values are at stake | Will Hutton

Three years ago, 48% of us voted Remain. If another vote were taken in the near future, the figure would probably top 50%. But perish the current leading politician or businessperson who makes the case for ongoing membership of this remarkable international organisation on our doorstep. Apart from a few outliers, it is taken as a political given that Britain must leave the EU; the divisive question is in what form.  For although the focus is largely on the undoubted deleterious economic impact – the worse the harder the Brexit – the bigger question is what country do we want to be. The EU has rightly become the talismanic issue of our times.  For if you support EU membership, you will tend to own a cluster of other values and principles. You recognise that today’s economies and societies are interdependent and that it’s imperative to have institutions to manage those interdependencies, whether on climate change or the overarching power of the new technopolists. You are not instinctively distrustful, even hostile, to other cultures, languages and peoples: you find diversity attractive and enriching. You are for openness and tolerance. While proud of your country, you do not see that pride compromised by working with and alongside other countries and peoples.  You do not believe in capitalism red in tooth and claw; you see the case for stakeholder capitalism, for the regulation of finance and for using state power to promote competition and innovation. You celebrate the role of trade unions in giving employees voice and vital countervailing power. You do not regard low taxation as the be-all and end-all of public policy. You uphold the values behind a social contract in which members of society accept mutual rights and obligations, so sustaining strong public health and education and social insurance that supplies income in adversity or old age. You believe in strong public institutions, ranging from the BBC to museums, which so enrich our country.  Propounding EU membership is thus a civilisational proposition. It does not mean that you regard every aspect of the EU – its unsigned-off accounts or the intricacies of the common agricultural policy – as perfect. But then neither is every aspect of the UK. But it does mean that you sign up for a set of interlocking propositions, shared by other Europeans, which better allow people to live lives they have reason to value.  Standing in opposition is a very different set of values and principles. To want to leave is to deny international interdependencies in order to assert national “control”. You reject mutuality of international obligation and the necessary pooling of sovereignty and sharing of law and resource to achieve common ends that would otherwise be impossible. Rather, the moral injunction for state and individual alike is to stand alone and act solely in your own interests. The EU is a hostile “other”: it spends our money and sets objectionable regulations, although when challenged, no regulation can be cited whose aim can reasonably be contested. Small wonder; they reflect the will not just of the British parliament, but of the parliaments of Europe.  You object to the EU’s openness – to trade, ideas and people – especially to European citizens who can live and work in Britain as of right. It matters not that the British have equal rights: who would want to have the right to leave their homeland to become a citizen of anywhere? At the limit, you can only trust your own, who share the “indigenous” culture and love of home; those from other cultures, who speak other languages and worship other religions, are the alien other whose presence is necessarily the principal cause of your own and wider society’s ills.  Brexit is thus a parallel civilisational proposition – to create a world of closure, intolerance and suspicion of the other. Economically, this will express itself as less trade, less inward investment and less growth – and reduced capacity to work with other countries to confront common challenges. But that is less the point than the impact on our civilisation. We will become more intolerant, more mean spirited, accelerating the trends already clear since the referendum. We will be ever more suspicious and hostile to people of colour, the European, the Jew and the Muslim. We will contract and be diminished.  Thus the “vox pop” calls from the bluff Yorkshire pensioner or Essex white-van driver to get on with Brexit or parallel calls from their MPS to respect the “will of the people” cannot be tamely and mutely accepted. I don’t believe that the mass of the British want to embrace the choice Brexit represents or that those who voted Leave hold views that are immutable. They are fellow Brits and fellow Europeans who have fallen prey to callow leaders and trash populist argument. It may be that Theresa May gets a narrow majority on the third or fourth time of asking for her “ deal”. But while trying to limit the economic damage, this will end up with Britain having the worst of all worlds – tracking the EU without influencing it, while embracing closure.  But whatever the deal, the civilisational challenge cannot be dodged. I do not want to live in the kind of country that Brexit is creating and I believe a majority share that view. If we leave, millions of us will seek to convert our fellow citizens and remind them that so much of what goes to make us British has roots in very different values from those feeding Brexit.  Above all, we will look to leaders, so sadly absent in our two main political parties, who lead and form public opinion, instead of following what they imagine it to be. We did not want or choose this battle. But now it is upon us, we have to take up the peaceful arms of persuasion, words and argument – and fight to win it.  • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist<|im_end|>

# Council Tax officially rises £78 next week - search how much yours will go up

It's official - council tax will rise by an average of £78 next week.  Bills will soar 4.7% across England from April 2019, bringing the average Band D bill from £1,671 to £1,750.  That's according to official government figures released today. But the rise will vary depending on where you live and what Band of house you live in.  So earlier this year we put together a comprehensive searchable guide to how much rates are set to rise in your area. Just enter your postcode below.  The Mirror predicted almost perfectly the average Band D bill would rise £72, excluding a few pounds for fire services and parish councils.  Some areas will see the cost of a Band D 'standard' bill tip over £2,000 in the first time in history. They include Rutland, East Midlands, as we revealed.  Scroll down to use our interactive search tool.  Leicestershire County Council leader Nick Rushton, a spokesman for the County Councils Network, said: "No-one wants to put up council tax.  "But many of us have very little option with county authorities facing the most severe financial pressures.  "Despite welcome announcements last year, the picture remains extremely challenging; council tax rises alone will not offset the funding pressures social care authorities face.  "This has left most of us unable to turn down desperately-needed resource, particularly when there is finite money for care services."  Richard Watts, Chair of the Local Government Association’s Resources Board, added: "Between 2010 and 2020, councils will have lost almost 60p out of every £1 the Government had provided for services.  “Faced with a government funding settlement that assumes maximum council tax rises and such funding pressures, many councils feel they have little choice but to ask residents to pay more council tax again this year to help them try and protect their local services.  “With councils facing a funding gap of more than £3 billion this year, council tax rises will not prevent the need for continued cutbacks to local services.  “If the Government fails to adequately fund local government as part of the Spending Review there is a real risk to the future financial viability of some services and councils.”  Despite forcing councils to put up tax if they want to plug years of cuts - and allowing rises way above inflation to do so - the Tories brazenly tried to shift the blame to Labour today.  The party issued a statement by Local Government Minister Rishi Sunak claiming the average Labour council tax costs £92 more than the average Conservative council.  He said: “Up and down the country, it’s Conservative councillors and councils who have a proven record of managing taxpayers’ money wisely and providing better local services.”  Labour issued its own research claiming exactly the opposite - that Labour councils charge less council tax.  Andrew Gwynne, Labour’s Shadow Communities and Local Government Secretary, said: “The Government has no answers to the dire situation facing our councils.  “Tory austerity has devastated communities but instead of providing sustainable funding, this Government has shifted the pain onto council taxpayers.  So how much will YOUR council tax rise?  Simply enter your postcode and Band (this should be on last year's bill) below to see your area's projected rise in April 2019. Scroll down for a fuller explanation of what the figures mean.<|im_end|>

# DIRT-TRACK ROUNDUP: Lucas Wolfe races to $4,080 triumph in Williams Grove Speedway opener

Lucas Wolfe won his second consecutive Williams Grove Speedway sprint-car opener on Sunday afternoon. The win was also Wolfe's second in an area track season opener this season. Wolfe's 20th career Williams Grove win was worth $4,080, in acknowledgement of the Grove's 80th year. Wolfe started third and trailed pole-sitter T.J. Stutts, who outgunned Dillsburg's Anthony Macri at the start. Macri hounded Stutts from the start and on the 12th lap, in lapped traffic, made a move for the lead. Macri edged Stutts on the backstretch, but tangled with a lapped car entering turn three, knocking the front wing from his car and forcing him to retire to the pits. Stutts regained the lead and held it until the 23rd of 25 laps, when Wolfe, who at one time had slipped to fourth, was able to get by. Wolfe held the lead to the finish, with ninth-starter Danny Dietrich passing Stutts on the final lap for second. Stutts finished third followed by Ryan Smith and 11th-starter Dale Blaney at the finish. Hard charger Freddie Rahmer advanced from the 24th and final starting spot to finish sixth. Rounding out the top 10 were Brian Montieth, Dover's Chad Trout, Brock Zearfoss and York's Cory Haas. Wolfe also won the season opener on Sunday, March 10, at Lincoln Speedway. OTHER DIRT TRACK RACING Dietrich triumphs at Lincoln: Dietrich raced to his first win of the season in Saturday afternoon’s 25-lap, sprint-car feature at Lincoln Speedway. Dietrich’s 44th career Lincoln win was worth $3,500. Dietrich grabbed the early lead from his pole starting position, but didn’t lead the whole event. As the leaders worked lapped traffic on the sixth lap, Macri, who started second, passed Dietrich for the lead. Macri would hold the top spot until the exciting final lap of the race. Dietrich passed Macri on the first and second turns for the lead, and sixth-starter Ryan Smith got by Macri on the final turn for second. Macri had to settle for third, with York’s Chase Dietz in fourth and 11th-starter Freddie Rahmer in fifth. Rounding out the top 10 were Montieth, who started 17th, Jim Siegel, Zearfoss, Trout and Lewisberry’s Kyle Moody. In the Legends feature, Spring Grove’s Harlon Leppo secured the victory. Leppo passed Craley’s Bill Diehl for the lead on the 11th of 20 laps, but Diehl regained the lead on lap 15, before Leppo took over for good on lap 16. Diehl finished second, with Jeremy Ott, Mason Chaney and first-lap leader Zachary Settle in the top five. Hanover's Schuchart gets Outlaws win: Hanover's Logan Schuchart got his first World of Outlaws win of the season Saturday in Stockton, California. Schuchart had won earlier this year in Australia. His win came over Brad Sweet, with Tim Kaeding in third. Aaron Reutzel and D.J. Netto completed the top five. Rounding out the top 10 were Rico Abreu, Carson Macedo, Donny Schatz, Cory Eliason and Sheldon Haudenschild. Hanover's Jacob Allen, Schuchart's uncle and teammate, finished 22nd. Macedo scored his first Outlaws win of the season Friday at Chico, California. Sweet finished second, with Ian Madsen, Schatz and Dominic Scelzi in the top five. Schuchart, Tim Shaffer, Shane Golobic, Daryn Pittman and Abreu completed the top 10. Brent Marks was 12th and Allen was 26th. Port Royal postpones Saturday opener: Port Royal officials elected to postpone Saturday's season opener because of predicted cold weather and wind.

# It s a big step backwards: Manchester United boss after FA Cup loss

It's a big step backwards: Manchester United boss after FA Cup loss  United were well beaten by an eager Wolves side who scored two goals in the space of six minutes in the second half through Raul Jimenez and Diogo Jota  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted Manchester United produced the poorest performance of his reign as Wolves sent them crashing out of the FA Cup on Saturday with a 2-1 quarter-final win.  United were well beaten by an eager Wolves side who scored two goals in the space of six minutes in the second half through Raul Jimenez and Diogo Jota, with Marcus Rashford's injury-time effort a consolation. "Today was the poorest performance we've had since I've been here," said Solskjaer.  "It was a big step backwards. There was a lack of urgency going forwards and a lack of forward passing and a lack of regains. We felt too comfortable in possession and we never put their keeper under pressure or their defenders under pressure."  Meanwhile, Manchester City produced a comeback against Swansea on Saturday to reach the semi-finals and keep their quadruple dreams alive. Pep Guardiola's team roared back from a two-goal deficit to score three times after the break, with Sergio Aguero grabbing a late winner in a 3-2 victory.

# COMMENTARY: When your family legacy is ‘the broken ones,’ the college admissions scam hits a nerve - National | Globalnews.ca

By now we’ve all heard about it. Twitter’s been trending all week with hashtags from #collegescam, #OperationVarsityBlues to #AuntBecky. On Tuesday, the United States Department of Justice accused more than 50 people — including 33 parents and 13 college-athletics coaches — of a nationwide scheme to get their children admitted into prestigious colleges. And it’s just the tip of the iceberg because Lord only knows how many thousands more there are, shaking in their designer boots, yet to be caught.  The alleged ringleader behind the scheme is William Singer, who has pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering conspiracy, money-laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Over the last eight years, parents (including actress Lori Loughlin and Hollywood couple Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy) allegedly paid anywhere from thousands to upwards of a million dollars to score their kids’ admission into some of America’s most prestigious schools. Singer used his fake charity to funnel bribe money to coaches and test administrators. Not another headline — this is personal When I first heard about the college admissions scam I was shocked, though not surprised. Privilege begets privilege. It’s not a new phenomenon. Like most of us, I’ve known about college donations and legacy admissions, though never heard anything quite to this egregious extent. And the more I learned, the more I was triggered. I didn’t quite expect my emotions to run so deep — but it has literally felt like a proverbial slap across the face. I think the timing of this story is partly why it hit such a nerve. Just last week, I spoke at an International Women’s Day event, and a significant part of my talk was the power of education and breaking the cycle of poverty. It was an extremely emotional day as it was the first time I was sharing my family’s history and their relationship with education. Even my father attended (the sole male in the room), recognizing the profound moment for our family. Looking through the lens of ‘The Broken Ones’ “Ours is a battle — not for wealth, nor for power. Ours is a battle for freedom, for reclamation of human personality.” — Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Though our story dates back much farther, I’ll begin with Govind Solanki. He was born in 1912 in a small village in Gujarat, India. He was born into a very poor and very low caste family, in fact, lower than the lowest caste — below the caste system — he was what was called an ‘Untouchable’. While originally caste was based upon a person’s work, it soon became hereditary. Each person was born into an unalterable social status. Because of Solanki’s low status in society, he was not allowed to attend school. If lower caste children wanted an education, they had to sit outside of the school and listen — their mere shadow was seen to be tainted, so the children had to lay face-down at a distance when an upper caste person passed by. They were often humiliated and ridiculed so gravely that most of them chose to work instead, avoiding the degradation on the school ground. Uneducated, Solanki worked a meagre job, remained in poverty and was struck with illness at a young age. It eventually led to his early death, leaving behind a young widow and four children. He did not have a strange incurable disease. He had asthma. Asthma. A very treatable illness, even then. But poverty doesn’t afford such “luxuries” as medication. By the next generation, conditions for Untouchables or Dalits (‘the broken ones’) improved slightly in an era of segregation. The children were allowed to attend school, though forced to sit in the back of the classroom. They were also not allowed to drink from the school water well. Despite all of this, Solanki’s son, Vimal, did well at school. He finished primary school, went on to high school in a nearby village and then went a big step further and got his Bachelor of Science degree. He was the only child in his village to get that far with his education at that time. In 1976 he married a beautiful Indian woman who was studying in England at the time. Her family had fled to East Africa in search of a better life, away from the chains of the caste system. The pair resolved to never suffer the same fate as those before them — adamant that the one thing that could change their destiny and break the cycle of poverty was education. His wife studied fervently and became a midwife and Vimal too furthered his education with another degree. That man, Vimal Solanki, is my father. This is our family’s story and there are many like it. My family has been deeply affected by caste, classism and racism. They have borne witness as the upper crust made “donations” to slot their children into the best schools, while they struggled for entry to any. There were no leg ups for them. Theirs was a corrupt social structure specifically designed to kick down the impoverished and keep them there. Painstaking hard work, drive and determination have gotten them to where they are today. Early on, they instilled that same work ethic in my brother and myself. Education is paramount — but it has to be earned to be meaningful. Knowing is not half the battle Having overcome the chains of an elitist power structure, my parents have held a somewhat idyllic hope that opportunities in the western world should allow any of us, with drive and determination, to rise to the top. Though at our core, I think every marginalized person gets that the playing field is not level. And yet while we see that privilege offers a head-start, we also believe in the possibility of winning the race. Like my parents, I catch myself falling into the pipedream that anything is possible with hard work — because I want to believe it. Well, quite frankly this scam sucked the life out of my “you can do anything” balloon. The cruel joke of meritocracy Both in Canada and the U.S. university admissions are heavily swayed in favour of the wealthy. The U.S. attorney Andrew Lelling said himself in a news conference earlier this week: “We’re not talking about donating a building … We’re talking about fraud” — ironically pointing to the well-known legal schemes allowing access to entry for the elite. With admission rates hovering around five to six per cent for Harvard and Yale and priority given to legacy students, athletic recruits and high-profile wants, the odds look grim for the average applicant. WATCH: The U.S. college admissions scandal unfolds  As a parent myself, I understand our desire to do anything possible to give our children the best we can — but putting ourselves above the law seems like terribly misguided judgment, not to mention bad parenting. Adding insult to injury, these wealthy families have access to tutors, test programs and all the other luxuries to prepare for admissions prep that most other children aren’t afforded. Ironically, Singer’s so-called charity was supposed to be helping “underserved kids.” And we should really focus some of our outrage on those taking these bribes — the coaches and administrators — as they are the keepers of these schools and should be held to highest account. Becky with the good heir While I actually hold some shred of sympathy for the “Operation Varsity Blues” kids who may not have known about their parents’ scheming — the real victims in this are those deserving, over-achieving and underprivileged children whose possible ticket to redefining their families’ legacies was instead given to these teens.  I also feel deeply for the many people of colour who are told time and time again that theirs was not an admission of merit, but one of race. And I am deeply saddened for the marginalized people who are actually sitting in jails today, in the hopes of giving their children a better education or any education at all. Because when it’s all said and done, I’ll be surprised if Loughlin, Huffman or any of these high-rolling “Desperate Parents” face jail time for their crimes. Bringing down the house There’s a reason it’s so difficult to topple these existing power structures. Those who have earned their way to the top through hard work and commitment aren’t afraid of putting a hand out to lift up their sisters or saying yes to affirmative action because they understand all the parts of the equation. Perhaps those over-privileged and underwhelming talented may want to “keep things the good ol’ way” because deep inside they know they’re not good enough and the only way to keep the facade alive is with their pocketbooks. While my family legacy may not reek of wealth, it also doesn’t hold the filthy stench of foul entitlement — and for that I am grateful.<|im_end|>

# Man accused of killing attorney faces new charges

SUNNY ISLES BEACH, Fla. - Joseph Franco was back in jail Wednesday evening, after prosecutors charged him with DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide. Franco, 27, was driving a Honda Odyssey on Collins Avenue when ran over Amir Pelleg killing him. The 34-year-old attorney was with his two daughters, 2-year-old Aviva and 6-year-old Ariella, and his wife, Zulma Guillot. The three were injured during the July 2018 crash.   Prosecutors had already charged Franco with tampering with physical evidence. Authorities confirmed detectives' suspicions that he had been under the influence of the "whippets" inhalant drug after witnesses told detectives he threw away a duffel bag with 12 used nitrous oxide metal cannisters. His co-workers at Kayne Anderson Real Estate and his friends at Beth Torah Synagogue mourned the young father's death. Late last year, Guillot said she and her daughters were having a very hard time without Pelleg. "I just tell them to pray and that their daddy is in their heart," Guillot said. "Emotionally is very challenging for them to understand that they won't see their father again." Copyright 2019 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.<|im_end|>

# Ciminelli selling Elmwood buildings could mark end of Arbor + Reverie

Ciminelli Real Estate Corp.'s big apartment project proposal on Elmwood Avenue was a major source of controversy in the surrounding neighborhoods. But in the end, it may have been, well, just a reverie.  More than than 30 months after acquiring 11 properties on Elmwood and unveiling a major redevelopment plan, the Buffalo-based firm has agreed to sell five of them – including the prominent former J.P. Bullfeathers restaurant site – to a small family-owned group that owns fewer than 40 apartments of its own around the region.  That could mark the end of the Arbor + Reverie project, Ciminelli's $40 million plan to demolish the 11 existing structures and erect a pair of new condominium and apartment buildings in their place at Bidwell Parkway and Potomac Avenue.  The initial project, unveiled in November 2016, would have included nearly 100 condominiums and apartments, eight retail storefronts and a three-level parking structure in the two five-story buildings. It was designed to transform that part of the neighborhood and bring in a new demographic, but was quickly denounced by neighbors as inappropriate and out-of-scale with Elmwood.  Ciminelli tried to appease neighbors by suspending its demolition request, withdrawing one of the building proposals and scaling back the other to four stories. But vocal residents still fought the initiative, ultimately forcing the developer to shelve the project as it was originally conceived.  It sold three apartment houses on Potomac and Ashland avenues to investors from downstate and from Watertown, allowed a new restaurant to open in another building on Elmwood, and tried unsuccessfully to win city approval to turn the Bullfeathers property into a parking lot. But the latest sale indicates that the project may have gone from limbo to abandonment, and Ciminelli is apparently now entertaining offers on the other properties.  "We have had several parties express interest in the Elmwood Avenue buildings but all of the properties are still in our ownership; nothing has been finalized," said spokeswoman Anne Duggan. "While we still continue to explore and evaluate all options, there are no current development plans."  Whitesand Family LP said Tuesday that it has signed a purchase agreement to acquire five buildings, but did not say how much it was paying for the properties at 1006-1008, 1010, 1020, 1024 and 1028 Elmwood. The deal is expected to close within four months, said developer and Whitesand Partner Tom Sand.  The properties include Bullfeathers, a longtime former Elmwood Village restaurant at 1010 Elmwood, as well as three storefronts and more than 10 apartments.  "Our plan is to lease the restaurant," Sand said. "We don't plan on making any changes to that property."  The building at 1006-1008 Elmwood has two retail stores and five apartments, and Sand said they plan to "do some upgrades" to that building, but no structural changes.  The other three buildings to the north of the restaurant are two-story doubles, with a single storefront at 1028 Elmwood that is occupied by a comic book store. The units are mostly occupied.  Sand said the developer is considering demolishing those three houses and replacing them with a four-story mixed-use building of both apartments and retail space. He said the firm met on Monday with neighbors from surrounding block clubs and the overall Elmwood Village to discuss the proposal and seek input, but recognizes that "we'll get a lot of pushback from that, but that is what we are trying to do."  Whitesand will announce more information about its plans in the coming weeks, with initial plans going before an upcoming Buffalo Zoning Board of Appeals meeting. The project would likely also come to the city Planning Board, but "we're just exploring it at this point in time," he added.  He declined to estimate a total value for the projects.  “We have a chance to pump new life into a sorely missed restaurant and bar space while also adding a mix of modern apartments and built-to-the-sidewalk retail," Sand said. "We’re excited about creating additional retail spaces that will enhance the shopping opportunities in the Elmwood Village and attract more people to Elmwood."  Whitesand is a family partnership consisting of Sand, Don White and other relatives. The firm owns four multifamily rental properties in Buffalo, Amherst, Blasdell and North Carolina, with two more under development.  In the Elmwood Village, the family owns and manages 16 luxury apartments and two studio units at 305 West Utica, and is almost finished with 297 West Utica, which will have eight new luxury apartments and another studio when it's completed. In all, it will have 39 units, prior to the Ciminelli purchase.  Sand said he and his family have been "looking for some properties" to add to their portfolio, now that they're finishing up their West Utica Street project. So when a realtor approached him about the Ciminelli properties, the family seized the opportunity.<|im_end|>

# Mindtree promoters vow to oppose ‘unprecedented, hostile takeover’ by L&T

A day after Larsen & Toubro (L&T) announced its plans to acquire up to 66 per cent stake in Mindtree, the promoters of the Bengaluru-based IT company Tuesday vowed to oppose the hostile takeover bid. Calling it a “grave threat” to the company, they said the acquisition lacked “any strategic advantage”, reported news agency PTI.  “A hostile takeover by Larsen and Toubro, unprecedented in our industry, could undo all of the progress we’ve made and immensely set our organisation back,” the promoters said in a statement, reported PTI.  “We don’t see any strategic advantage in the transaction and strongly believe that the transaction will be value destructive for all shareholders. Our collective success depends on building and nurturing relationships with our clients and partners,” they added.  Mindtree’s shares fell at least 1.7 per cent on Tuesday.  L&T has reached an agreement with V G Siddhartha, the owner of Coffee Day Trading and Coffee Day Enterprises, to acquire a 20.32 per cent stake in Mindtree at Rs 980 per share, aggregating to around Rs 3,269 crore.  It has also placed an order to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake from the open market. And, apart from this, it wants to purchase 31 per cent stake of the outstanding shares through an open offer.  With 66.32 per cent stake in Mindtree, L&T would become the majority shareholder.  The board members of Mindtree, meanwhile, are expected to meet on Wednesday, March 20, to consider the proposal of a buyback of shares of the company.  Subroto Bagchi, who co-founded Mindtree in 1999, said Sunday that he would return and try and save the company from “an imminent threat of hostile takeover”.  He had tweeted: “An imminent threat of hostile takeover of Mindtree has made me to resign from the Government to be able to go, save the company. I must protect the Tree from people who have arrived with bulldozers & saw chains to cut it down so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall.”  (With inputs from PTI)<|im_end|>

# Weak U.S. Dollar A Tailwind For Global Growth - Aberdeen Asset Management

The 10% depreciation of the trade-weighted U.S. dollar over the past year is an underappreciated driver of the synchronized upswing in world trade and global economic growth. That’s because movements in the U.S. dollar can have global consequences above and beyond movements in any other currency.  For example, U.S. dollar appreciation tends to crimp global trade and credit flows, while dollar depreciation tends to boost global trade and credit. Whether dollar weakness continues or reverses in 2018 will therefore be a key driver of whether the upswing in global economic growth can continue.  Appreciation and depreciation – does it really matter globally?  In standard open-economy macroeconomics, currency appreciation raises the cost of a country’s exports in international markets and lowers the cost of its imports in its own currency. With its exports more expensive and its imports cheaper, the country exports less and imports more.  This deterioration in the trade balance means less demand for domestically produced goods, lowering domestic economic activity in the country while simultaneously boosting activity in the rest of the world. In this simple setting, the aggregate global impact is neutral.  Similarly, currency depreciation lowers the cost of a country’s exports in international markets while raising the cost of imports in its own currency. Export demand increases and import demand declines. The trade balance improves, as does overall domestic activity in the country, while it simultaneously falls in the rest of the world. Aggregate global activity is unchanged.  The trade reaction  The key assumption underlying this logic is that the prices of goods are “sticky” in the currency of the country producing them. Exporters set the price of goods in their own currency and then vary the price when denominated in foreign currencies in line with exchange-rate fluctuations.  Hence, in international markets, currency appreciation makes a country’s goods more expensive, and currency depreciation makes a country’s goods less expensive.  The problem with this assumption is that it doesn’t seem to reflect the reality of how international trade actually works. The price of many countries’ exports sold in international markets just don’t seem to move much in response to changes in bilateral exchange rates with trading partners.  Indeed, work by Harvard economist Gita Gopinath suggested that a 1% move in the bilateral exchange rate between two countries moves their bilateral terms of trade (the relative price of their imports and exports) by just 0.1%.  Why the indifference?  The key to unraveling this disconnect is that a large share of international trade is transacted in U.S. dollars, even when the U.S. itself is not party to the transaction, and the prices of goods transacted in U.S. dollars are “sticky” in dollars.  For example, while the U.S. is on one side or the other of around 10% of world trade, the U.S. dollar is used in about 40% of trade transactions.  The UK sells nearly 30% of its exports in dollars, despite sending only 15% of them to the U.S.; Japan sells half its exports in dollars, despite sending 22% of them to the U.S.; and Argentina sells a whopping 97% of its exports in dollars, while sending just 8% of them to the U.S.  Importance of USD – “Uncle Sam the Middle Man”  To understand the significance of this, imagine that China is selling goods to India, and the transaction is invoiced in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the rupee-renminbi exchange rate therefore do not impact the price or quantity of goods sold in the way that standard open-economy macroeconomics suggests.  Instead, fluctuations in the rupee-dollar exchange rate are what matter: U.S. dollar appreciation could raise the cost of Chinese exports to India, no matter what the renminbi is doing, thereby reducing Indian demand for Chinese goods.  All this means that world trade volumes are driven in large part by the U.S. dollar exchange rate. The dominant role of the U.S. dollar in international trade invoicing means that dollar appreciation crimps demand not only for U.S. exports but also for all dollar-denominated exports. Dollar appreciation is a headwind for world trade. Meanwhile, dollar depreciation is a tailwind for global trade.  This trade-invoicing transmission channel is reinforced by the widespread use of the U.S. dollar as a funding currency for debt issuance and cross-border bank lending. Non-U.S. borrowers (particularly in emerging markets) frequently issue debt and obtain bank loans denominated in dollars – a practice known as “original sin.”  U.S. dollar appreciation can then increase the local-currency cost of servicing a given amount of dollar debt, which then means that fewer resources are available for hiring, investment and production.  It also increases the probability of default, causing lenders to rein in the amount of dollar lending they are willing to extend and to raise the interest rate on the lending they do still undertake. Higher interest rates mean that financial conditions tighten, further exacerbating the hit to economic activity. Dollar depreciation, on the other hand, has the opposite impact, boosting credit flows and easing financial conditions, all of which should boost global economic growth.  The dominant currency paradigm  This is all encapsulated in the so-called dominant currency paradigm: trade prices are sticky in dollars, meaning that the value of a country’s currency relative to the dollar is a primary driver of a country’s import prices and quantities regardless of where the goods originates. Gopinath found that this means a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation against all other currencies leads to a 0.6–0.8% decline within a year in the volume of total trade between countries in the rest of the world.  The 10% trade-weighted depreciation of the U.S. dollar over the past year is therefore likely to have played a significant role in the recent revival of world trade growth and will continue to feed through into decent trade growth for much of this year given the lags involved.  Further dollar weakness in 2018 would provide another fillip for global economic activity and could make even our upbeat global gross domestic product (GDP) forecasts look too conservative. On the other hand, renewed dollar strength would point to more caution on the outlook for global growth. Now, if only there was a fool-proof way to forecast currency moves.  Important Information  Foreign securities are more volatile, harder to price and less liquid than U.S. securities. They are subject to different accounting and regulatory standards, and political and economic risks. These risks are enhanced in emerging markets countries.<|im_end|>

# Solskjaer full transcript from first interview as permanent Man Utd manager

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been confirmed as Manchester United's permanent manager after a successful spell in caretaker charge.  The Norwegian has penned a three-year year deal at Old Trafford after winning 14 of his 19 matches in the hot seat so far.  Under his stewardship, the Red Devils have closed to within two points of the top four and have reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League.  Solskjaer replaced Jose Mourinho in December and has been credited with turning United's season around.  He has now given his first interview since been confirmed as permanent manager, and here's every word he had to say...  How does it feel to become permanent manager of this great club?  "It’s truly an honour and I think everyone knows - and I’ve spoken about it in the last few months - that this is a dream job for anyone in football and especially for anyone who’s been involved in Manchester United .  "To be given the opportunity to move the club forward, with all the potential there is, it’s fantastic."  You've had so much backing from the fans, how does that feel?  "I’ve always had it, but I have to say the last few months have been absolutely crazy with the way they’ve taken to the players, to me and the coaching staff. We’ve really appreciated that support and hopefully we can pay them back now."  To know all of the staff right from the very top all the way down are right behind, how much does that help?  "It feels great. It’s been three fantastic months, the support I’ve had here from when I walked in and saw Kath to the chats I’ve had with Ed, the owners, the staff in and around here, it’s been great.  "It’s nice to pay back the belief they’ve shown in me. We’ve had some good performances, we’ve had an upturn. That’s from Joel and Avi and the Glazer family, to Ed, down to players, staff, it’s just been three great months and I hope to pay everyone back."  How much have the likes of Mick (Phelan), Kieran (McKenna) and Michael (Carrick) helped you realise this dream?  "It’s a team effort. This is not just about the manager, this is about the coaching team, what we’ve done together, the players, the staff at Carrington and it’s the supporters.  "I love coming in to work with the staff we’ve got."  You had huge success as a player here, how much do you want to replicate that as a manager?  "That’s the demand at Man Utd, the success and striving to improve, winning trophies. That's another challenge for us, we want to be up there challenging every season from now on."  There are many challenges ahead, both short and long-term, but how excited are you to face them?  "I wouldn't have said yes if I wasn’t looking forward to it and I didn't belief in the club, the potential and in what we’re doing. I feel and I hope that I can do this job justice, that was the first thing I asked myself when I got this job a few months back.  "Hopefully now I can even improve on it."  Start planning a bit longer-term, with a busy pre-season and no doubt a busy transfer window, how excited are you for these opportunities?  "Then we have games coming up, the summer transfer window, improving the squad, talking to the players about how we want them to approach next season coming back.  "I’ve been discussing with Ed and the club my ideas for the future, now they’re my decisions to make."  It's going to be a really busy summer?  "Yeah, but I’m looking forward to it. If you don’t look forward to working for this club then that’s wrong. I can’t wait, I’ve prepared more or less my whole adult life, or at least since my injury, to be a manager somewhere and I’ve always been stupid, or naive, or daft enough to dream about this job."  How proud and excited are your family for you and what lies ahead?  "We’ve really enjoyed the last eight years in Norway, living there, it’s going to be a change for them but we’re looking forward to it.  "These three months, or six months (I was originally appointed for), we agreed we’d do it separately as a family as there wasn’t any need to move them over. That’s gone now, we’ll be moving over together.  "We built a house, or I started it, in 2007, finally maybe in 2019 we can move into it. That’s a lot of planning."  No more questions in press conferences about your long-term future?  "That’s going to be a nice change. But you get criticised, you get praised, every day is a test, this isn’t going to be a sleeping pillow, it’s going to be an extra boost of energy to do even more for the club."  Proud to know caretaker role is no more - you’re the manager of Manchester United?  "That caretaker in front of manager didn’t really sit right with me. I’ve enjoyed it so far, I said I was going to enjoy it until it’s over. I still think that’s my mantra, this is a fantastic opportunity."<|im_end|>

# Free-agent Cameron Artis-Payne returns to Panthers as team seeks McCaffrey complement

The Carolina Panthers have re-signed running back Cameron Artis-Payne, announcing the move Thursday morning.  The fifth-year back returned to the Panthers on a one-year contract, extending his stay with the team that drafted him in the fifth round in the 2015 NFL draft.   Artis-Payne served as Christian McCaffrey’s primary backup last season after the team released C.J. Anderson in Week 11. While his 491 rushing yards in his first four seasons appear modest on paper, Panthers coach Ron Rivera said the team’s familiarity with Artis-Payne made them more comfortable with elevated him to second string following Anderson’s departure. “(Artis-Payne has) got a good skill set, he’s shown it,” Rivera said at the time. “He’s good out of the backfield as well, he just hasn’t had the opportunity. From what we’ve seen through preseasons and some of the regular season play that he’s had, we felt comfortable enough to go ahead and make the move.”  FLASH SALE! Unlimited digital access for $3.99 per month  Don't miss this great deal. Offer ends on March 31st!  #ReadLocal  The former Auburn Tiger is the second running back Carolina has signed this offseason; the team signed Charlotte native Elijah Hood to a one-year deal in February.  Rivera told reporters during the NFL Scouting Combine that Carolina is seeking a running back to spell McCaffrey, who played 91 percent of the team’s offensive snaps in 2018. He suggested the Panthers will target backs with similar skill sets as McCaffrey and praised what he called a “solid” group of running backs in the 2019 NFL draft class.  That said, whichever back earns that role likely won’t have a major workload placed on him. McCaffrey only touched the ball roughly one-third of the plays he was on the field for — the Panthers aren’t looking to lighten his responsibilities, but rather get him off the field more often.  “Understanding what Christian did last year, how many reps he played, that’s something we do have to be concerned with,” Rivera said. “Him touching the ball was no concern. It was just the extra plays. So we have to look at that and find a way to take that load from him.  “I think Christian shows you that he can carry the load no matter where he is, no matter where we run him - inside or outside, we run him out of the backfield as a receiver, that type of stuff. So really, it would be a guy who has, I would say, an almost similar type of skill set, that’s probably what we are looking for.”<|im_end|>

# Former Arsenal boss confirms he had tried to sign Sancho for the club

Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has acknowledged that he had tried to pursue Jadon Sancho from Manchester City. The teenager was heavily linked with the north London side during the summer of 2017 but the Citizens rather decided to offload him overseas with Borussia Dortmund acquiring his signature.  Sancho has grown from strength-to-strength during his time in the Bundesliga and his performances have been recognised by Gareth Southgate, who handed him his maiden England cap last year. Elsewhere, his showing has already caught the attention of other elite teams including Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain and there has already been the speculation that he could move on from Dortmund at the right price during the summer. Sancho, who has contributed seven goals and nine assists in the Bundesliga this term, is currently valued at nearly £100m but that has now warded off the interest from the likes of Paris Saint-Germain, who have already spent a combined package of £360m to lure Neymar and Kylian Mbappe to Parc des Princes over the past 18 months. Sancho was recently in Champions League round of 16 action at Tottenham Hotspur where Dortmund suffered a damaging 3-0 first leg defeat.<|im_end|>

# Conor McGregor ‘Aiming for July’ Return to the UFC • MMA News

Former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor is ready to resume his career with a targeted return date in July.  That’s what the Irishman said this past weekend while touring the United States in anticipation of St. Patrick’s day where he celebrated in both Boston and Chicago while promoting his whiskey brand Proper No. 12.  According to McGregor, he’s currently in talks with the UFC on a date, location and opponent but it appears he’s targeting July as the timeline for his next fight.  “We’re currently in negotiations. We’re aiming for July so we’ll see what happens,” McGregor told ABC7 in Chicago. “I am staying ready. This morning I was doing incline sprints on the treadmill on my program, the McGregor F.A.S.T. program, staying in a hotel room. So we’re staying on it. Getting work in as we go.”  July would be International Fight Week, which is always one of the marquee events for the UFC each and every year.  McGregor has fought on those cards previously and it seems that would be the biggest possible date for his return out of any of the currently scheduled events on the UFC calendar.  There is still no word on McGregor’s opponent after a fight with Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone seemingly fell apart when the UFC wanted them to serve as a co-main event on a card. McGregor, who is the biggest draw in the history of the sport, reportedly shot down that idea.  No matter who he faces, McGregor will obviously look to get back in line for a title shot as he hopes to avenge his last defeat against Khabib Nurmagomedov from last October.  As far as the work he’s doing in the States, McGregor is not only promoting his whiskey but he was able to attend an event where he helped honor first responders, which has become a cause close to his heart in recent years.  McGregor’s whiskey brand donates $5 of every case sold up to $1 million annually to first responders around the globe.  “We had an event for the first responders and we’re giving back to the first responders,” McGregor stated. “These are the people that run into buildings as we are running out. These are the proper heroes. So for me to come over here to go to an event to support these amazing, amazing people and meet them, hear their stories.  “I’ve had an insane couple of days. A really, truly uplifting couple of days so I’m very grateful to the people of Chicago.”<|im_end|>

# Counselors offer ‘loving sources of hope’ for women seeking abortions

By Natalie Hoefer  
Catholic News Service INDIANAPOLIS (CNS) — Two women stood near the busy road on a chilly February morning in Indianapolis. A steady, penetrating mist — and sometimes an icy splash from a speeding car — made for a dampness that digs deep and lingers despite layers of clothes. The temperature hovered just above freezing.  “It’s always 10 degrees colder here than anywhere else,” Sheryl Dye said with a patient grin. Her companion, Ann Clawson, nodded in agreement.  By “here” she meant the entrance of the driveway of the Planned Parenthood abortion facility on the northwest side of Indianapolis. It is the state’s largest abortion provider.   Dye and Clawson are committed to standing, praying and hailing approaching cars with a wave and a smile for at least two hours there every Wednesday morning.  They are members of the Indianapolis North chapter of Sidewalk Advocates for Life. Per its website, the organization’s mission is to train and support volunteers “to be the hands and feet of Christ, offering loving, life-affirming alternatives to all present at the abortion center, thereby eliminating demand and ending abortion.”  Dye and Debra Minott established the chapter in 2016 and currently serve as its coordinators.  Sidewalk counselors have been there for 13 years, since the facility opened in 2006, said Dye, 54. “It started as a grass-roots effort. … Deb and I used to counsel together. We started talking about the need for more comprehensive training and getting more people involved. Sidewalk Advocates has a great training program.”  Each chapter designates the abortion facility it will cover. A chapter also exists in Bloomington, covering the Planned Parenthood abortion center near Indiana University.  Being a sidewalk counselor does not require any kind of degree or persuasive ability, said Minott, 63, told The Criterion, newspaper of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.  “First and foremost (it requires) a very strong faith,” she said. “Because to be successful, you need to recognize you are an instrument of the Holy Spirit, and it’s not anything you’re doing.  “Second is a passion for life. If you’re not there believing that this is a life to be saved, it’s going to come through to the person you’re talking to.”  Having “thick skin” is needed, too, “because some of the things people say aren’t very nice,” admitted Minott, a member of St. Marie Goretti Parish in Westfield, Indiana, in the Diocese of Lafayette.  Both agree on several misconceptions about what sidewalk counselors do — that they are there to yell and protest against the abortion center, or there to shame the women as they drive in.  “No matter what is said to us, no matter what goes on, we are peaceful, loving sources of hope,” said Dye, a member of St. John the Evangelist Parish in Indianapolis. “Our goal is to let (the women) know there’s help, that there’s pain that can come with abortion, and that they’re better than that and don’t have to experience that.”  One might say the counselors’ first goal is to get a car to stop.  “We just wave and offer a big smile and make eye contact,” Dye said of the counselors’ approach to cars entering the drive.  “There are times when you get no one to stop, then sometimes you get eight cars to stop” during the two- to two-and-a-half-hour shifts, Minott added.  When a car does stop, a counselor offers the driver brochures and information on alternative pro-life organizations that will help them at no charge. For instance, 1st Choice for Women is a pregnancy clinic less than a mile from the abortion center. It is a ministry of Great Lakes Gabriel Project, which also sponsors the north Indianapolis Sidewalk Advocates chapter.  Counselors also offer to walk over immediately and meet the woman at the Women’s Care Center that abuts the north boundary of the Planned Parenthood property.  “Even if I talk to someone for a minute — and that’s really about all the time you have — and they still go in (to the abortion center), I believe my prayers have an impact,” Minott said of what counselors spend most of their time doing by the drive: praying.  Counselors often use a rosary booklet with tailor-made intentions Minott designed. But with volunteers from different faith backgrounds, any and all prayers are welcome, she said.  “If I didn’t have faith that being there praying was having an impact, I couldn’t go on doing it because there’s just not enough tangible rewards coming back to you,” Minott said.  Occasionally there are tangible rewards, though. Dye told the story of a woman who stopped not long ago to talk to a specific counselor.  “This woman said she had been driving up and down Georgetown Road for a year trying to find the counselor,” Dye said. “She wanted her to know that even though she went on in for her abortion after the counselor talked with her, she changed her mind, and she was now the mother of a healthy baby boy.”  At 69, Larry Clark has been a sidewalk counselor at the Planned Parenthood abortion center in Indianapolis for about 10 years. He, too, knows the joy of seeing a woman choose life for her baby.  “I’ve got to be here — it’s the right thing to do,” said Clark, a member of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish in Carmel, Indiana, in the Lafayette Diocese. “(The clients) need somebody — not only the children, but the moms and dads need us, too. … There’s nothing more cheering and exciting than when someone chooses life here in this driveway.”  Dye and Minott agree the mission of sidewalk counselors has become more urgent.  Dye said that in the six years since she’s been a counselor outside the abortion facility, “it’s getting harder to get (the women) to see that it’s something that could potentially cause harm to them. It’s hard because society tells them it’s no big deal.”  And with only 13 full-time sidewalk advocates, about 10 part-time and substitute volunteers, and the need to always have two counselors on each shift, the task is even more challenging, said Minott.  There is no “typical” counselor, said Dye, who is the mother of two grown children and a teacher at Lumen Christi Catholic School in Indianapolis.  “We have women and men, people who are outgoing and people who are more quiet, people who work and people who don’t work or are retired,” she said.  Minott also is married with two grown children. She is retired, running for the Carmel City Council, and has “a lot of other things going on.”  Clawson, a retiree in her mid-60s who also worships at St. Maria Goretti, is in her third month of volunteering.  She had a “save” on her first day of counseling — a woman she spoke with who decided to go to the Women’s Care Center instead of Planned Parenthood.  “That’s like being on cloud nine,” she said with a smile. “Those are the things that keep you coming.”  – – –  Hoefer is a reporter at The Criterion, newspaper of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.<|im_end|>

# Sheffield Wednesday striker Fernando Forestieri found not guilty of racially abusing opponent

Sheffield Wednesday footballer Fernando Forestieri has been found not guilty of racially abusing an opposition player before a mass brawl.  The 29-year-old striker was alleged to have called Mansfield Town defender Krystian Pearce "a n*****" during a pre-season friendly at the One Call Stadium on July 24 last year because he was "frustrated".  A district judge at Mansfield Magistrates' Court ruled it was possible the Mansfield captain may have misheard Forestieri, who claimed he was insulting him in Spanish.  In a prepared statement, Forestieri said he “swore on his son’s life” he did not racially abuse the Barbados international, claiming he must have been mistaken.  The game ended in a “40-man brawl” after Forestieri was booked for a scissor tackle on defender Hayden White just after the 80th minute.  Mr Pearce confronted Forestieri about the alleged incident after the match but he denied being racist, and apologised if the defender had “misheard”.  Forestieri, of Chambers Grove, Sheffield, denied racially aggravated harassment and using threatening words or behaviour and heard the verdict announced through a Spanish interpreter.  Recording a not guilty verdict on Thursday, District Judge Jonathan Taffe said: "It is clear that the conclusion to the game was anything but friendly, with a mass brawl breaking out which could have led to a wide scale public disorder amongst spectators.  "I do understand why Mr Forestieri wishes to make the point that he is not a racist - his personal and professional reputation is at stake.  "There were thousands of fans, rival fans, players and staff all shouting. This is relevant for, in my judgement, it possibly accounts for the fact that no other person, even those in close proximity, heard what was said."  The judge added: "I have to accept that it is possible, albeit in my judgement unlikely, that Mr Pearce was mistaken and therefore I cannot be satisfied to a criminal standard that the word 'n*****' was used and I therefore find Mr Forestieri not guilty as charged."  Leaving court after his trial, Forestieri declined to comment on the not guilty verdict.  Earlier the court had heard that there had been a "heated exchange of words – Mr Forestieri was speaking mainly in Spanish but used the word ‘n*****’ and ‘s***’.”  Mansfield Town manager, David Flitcroft, told the court he felt he had to enter the pitch to pull the Mr Pearce away from Forestieri after being informed of a “racist incident” by the fourth official.  Mr Flitcroft said: “My gut instinct was to get on the pitch and clear him from the pitch.  “When I went on Krystian told me what had been said. That’s when I knew I had to take him off the pitch.”  Addressing what Forestieri said in a voluntary police interview, Mr Conboy said: “He provided a prepared statement and gave an explanation for what he had said in Spanish.  “He initially accepted the he was abusive in Spanish but none of it would have represented any racial hostility.”  Mr Pearce insisted he was not mistaken in the witness box on Thursday.  He said: “I heard him say something. The sentence was in Spanish and in the middle of the sentence he used the word ‘n*****’ and at the end of the sentence he used the word ‘s***’.  “I then reacted to what he had said and told him to repeat it, which he didn’t.  “I tried to notify the referee as soon as I could, I think it must have been around a minute or two later.”  Mr Pearce continued: “The gaffer then came on to the pitch and took me off the pitch basically.  “I proceeded to go down the tunnel, I think I kicked a bag of balls in frustration.”  In the witness box, Forestieri was asked by his defence solicitor: “Did you at any stage call him a n*****?”  The striker replied: “No, I never said that, I’m not like that.  “I was very sad because I’m not a racist. The first rule in football is to respect your colleagues.”  In his prepared statement, Forestieri said: “He said to me that I needed to say sorry to him because he thought I said the ‘N’ word.  “He also told me if I don’t say sorry he will go to the police.  “I said I was sorry if that’s what he thought I heard but I swore on my son’s life that that was not what he heard.”  Forestieri added: “I wish to confirm I am not a racist person. I never said the ‘N’ word or anything racist to Mr Pearce as he has alleged or indeed to anyone else.  “I find the accusation deeply upsetting and very offensive.”<|im_end|>

# The face of the $2 coin may gain further recognition

Push for outback massacre survivor on the $2 coin to gain new recognition  Posted  An Aboriginal elder and massacre survivor immortalised on the Australian $2 coin could be further recognised if a bid to rename a vast Northern Territory electorate is successful. Key points: Independent NT MLA Scott McConnell said he was acting on behalf of constituents to call for his electorate to be renamed Gwoya Gwoya Tjungurrayi is the man depicted on the $2 coin and was a boomerang salesman and elder in Central Australia If the change is permitted, it will replace the current name of Stuart, after the Scottish pioneer John McDouall Stuart  NT parliamentarian Scott McConnell has penned a letter to the NT Electoral Commission calling for the name of his electorate of Stuart to be changed to Gwoya, to better represent the Indigenous heritage of the region. While most Australians would struggle to name the man behind the bearded profile on the small golden coin, Gwoya Tjungurrayi — who also went by the nickname of One Pound Jimmy — was an elder, a boomerang salesman and the first Aboriginal to be featured on a postage stamp. He died in 1965. The coin was designed by Horst Hahne, based on a drawing of Tjungurrayi by artist Ainslie Roberts.  Tjungurrayi also survived the Coniston Massacre, a brutal outback mass killing in 1928, where up to 60 people lost their lives. Mr McConnell said he'd been approached by constituents to push for the renaming. "It's time to look at the name of the electorate that I am privileged enough to represent the constituents of at the moment, the electorate of Stuart," Mr McConnell said. "This person is represented on the $2 coin, and as such is probably in most Australians' pocket at any one time, yet people don't know the story of him as a survivor of one of the most documented massacres in Australia, that took place only 90 years ago." He said the change would bring greater public awareness to this "eminent Aboriginal person" and to the Coniston Massacre. "I've always been an advocate for the fact that we need to tell this story much better," Mr McConnell said. "The story of the Coniston Massacre should be on the curriculum of every school." 'History on both sides': Price Former Member for Stuart Bess Price, who was also a minister in the last Country Liberal Party NT Government, said if the constituents of Stuart decided the name change was wanted, "it'd be great". "It it was the name the people chose to name the electorate after, I think people would embrace that," Ms Price said. Ms Price, a Warlpiri woman who calls Tjungurrayi "grandfather", said the move would be a way of acknowledging "history on both sides".  "[It would acknowledge] Aboriginal people having a part in it, and the explorers as well, being part of the Northern Territory," Ms Price said. "People, especially Aboriginal people, would accept and be happy about having a name change to someone like Gwoya." Stuart's controversial legacy The electorate is currently named after the intrepid Scottish explorer John McDouall Stuart, who is renowned as one of the great early white pioneers of inland Australia. His legacy is also shrouded in controversy. A statue of Stuart in Alice Springs triggered protests when it was erected in 2014, due to Stuart's alleged link to Aboriginal bloodshed in the Red Centre — this despite very little historical evidence existing to prove Stuart's role in any murders. Mr McConnell said the "considerable debate around Stuart as an explorer" weighed into the reasons behind calling for the name change. "A lot of opinions were expressed around Stuart's conduct, particularly in relation to how he interacted with Aboriginal people," Mr McConnell said. "There are widely held views of Stuart as the explorer — we're not going to take anything away from that [by changing the name] because there's so much recognition for Stuart in many other ways. "What we're doing is bring some greater recognition to this gentleman, [Gwoya]." Name change has precedent An electoral boundary redistribution process is currently underway in the Northern Territory, which could open the door to the possibility of name changes, pending a submission to and decision by the commission's Redistribution Committee. NT Electoral Commissioner Iain Loganathan said "all things are possible" and there was past precedent for such a change.  "There have been other name changes historically … particularly in terms of remote divisions, there has been a push to have them recognise Indigenous people who have made a significant contribution to the Northern Territory," Mr Loganathan said. "In that sense, that's how we got the seat of Namatjira in Central Australia" — which was named after famed Hermannsburg watercolour artist Albert Namatjira. Public submissions on the NT boundary redistribution close on March 29.<|im_end|>

# Guests can now learn to ‘swim like a mermaid’ at Disney resorts

Disney fans can finally become part of Ariel’s world.  Guests staying at select Disney World hotels have a chance to “swim like a mermaid” this year, according to Fox 35 Orlando.  Participants enrolled in the Mermaid School will be fitted with a “tail” and be taught how to splash around like the mythical sea creatures.  The “Under the Sea”-inspired classes will last an hour each and cost $50, the Disney Parks Blog reported.  Classes will be led by instructors from The Mermaid Academy, an Orlando-based company that offers swimming lessons to “make your mermaid dreams come true.”  Owner Joe O’Rouke is thrilled with his new partnership with The Mouse.  “We’re a very small company compared to Disney — we never thought this would happen,” he told the Post. “We’re one of the lucky ones.”  The Mermaid School begins mid-March and runs until December this year.  Destinations offering the aquatic experience include Disney’s Art of Animation Resort, Disney’s Caribbean Beach Resort and Disney’s Yacht and Beach Club Resorts.  To sign up for Disney’s mermaid adventure, call 407-WDW-PLAY for booking information.  Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<|im_end|>

# Teen Dies Of Tapeworm Egg Infestation In Brain After Complaining Of Seizures

Teen Dies Of Tapeworm Egg Infestation In Brain After Complaining Of Seizures  FARIDABAD, India – An 18-year-old who complained of seizures in the emergency room of an Indian hospital turned out to have parasites in his brain, according to a case study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Drs. Nishanth Dev and S. Zafar Abbas of the ESIC Medical College and Hospital in Faridabad reported that the patient, who appeared in the ER with swelling over his right eye, was having tonic-clonic seizures. Formerly known as “grand mal” seizures, these neural disturbances cause stiffened muscles and a loss of consciousness.  His parents said that their son had felt pain in his right groin for a week. A physical exam revealed that he had confusion and tenderness in the right testis.  To learn more about his condition, the medical staff performed an MRI exam and saw damage caused by cysts in his cerebral cortex (the outer mantle of brain tissue) as well as the brain stem, including the cerebellum, which sits at the back of the head above the spinal cord.  Diagnosis: neurocysticercosis, a parasitic disease of the brain caused when someone swallows tapeworm eggs that have passed in the feces of someone who has an intestinal tapeworm. The larvae crawl out of the eggs and into muscle and brain tissues, where they form cysts.  The doctors also discovered cysts in the patient’s right eye and right testis.  Because of the number and location of the cysts, his doctors decided against treating the young man with antiparasitic medications. These can worsen brain bleeding and inflammation while leading to loss of vision. Instead, the patient was given an anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone, plus antiepileptic medications.  Two weeks after his arrival in the ER, the patient died, Dev and Abbas report.  Cysticercosis infections occur worldwide, though these parasitic invasions of the human body mostly occur in rural areas of developing countries where pigs are allowed to roam and where sanitation practices are poor, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though these infections may be rare among people who live in countries where pigs do not have contact with human feces, cysticercosis can be acquired anywhere in the world, including the United States and other western nations.  Symptoms depend on the location of the cysts; sometimes, lumps form under the skin, and sometimes, confusion is the only sign of the damage occurring in the brain. Symptoms can appear months or even years after an infection, usually when the cysts start dying, causing swollen tissue.  Generally, these infections call for anti-parasitic drugs combined with anti-inflammatory medicines, but surgery may be necessary if a patient doesn’t respond or to reduce brain swelling. Symptoms may require care even if the paralytic infection itself no longer needs attention or treatment.  Patients with cysticercosis cannot spread their disease to other people; it is only people with a tapeworm infection in the intestine who can spread the potentially life-threatening eggs when proper hygiene is lacking or ignored.<|im_end|>

# The Truth About American Aid to Israel

Some 18,000 people descended on the Walter E. Washington Convention Center this week in the nation’s capital for the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. One of the country’s most influential lobbies, AIPAC has long been the subject of avid (and conspiratorial) condemnation by those who dislike the role it plays in sustaining bipartisan support for the Jewish state. In recent weeks, the famously press-shy organization unwittingly became the subject of a fierce national debate over anti-Semitism after Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar suggested that American elected officials support the Jewish state because they are paid to do so. Contrary to popular belief (an impression abetted by its confusing acronym), AIPAC does not donate money directly to candidates; it is not a political action committee. What AIPAC does do, like any interest group, is encourage its politically active membership to back candidates who pledge support for its agenda. Foremost among the group’s policy priorities is upholding the annual U.S. military aid package to Israel, which—at $3.8 billion per year—constitutes the largest, direct American military subvention to any single country. And it is this subvention which is one of the most frequently cited arguments critics muster to justify singling out Israel for opprobrium.  Contrasting the per capita amount received by Israel with “other allies who are as wealthy as Israel,” New York writer Andrew Sullivan calls the disparity “absurd.” In a piece entitled, “Time to Break the Silence on Palestine,” New York Times columnist Michelle Alexander decries “the $38 billion the U.S. government has pledged in military support to Israel” over the next decade. (Is there a cause whose advocates are less silent—in the media, on college campuses, in international fora—than that of the Palestinians?) Also in the New York Times, Nathan Thrall of the International Crisis Group states that Israel receives from Washington “more military financing than the United States provides to the rest of the world combined.” An organization ominously named “If Americans Knew” complains that “the U.S. provides Israel $10.5 million in military aid each day, while it gives the Palestinians $0 in military aid.” These seemingly objective attacks tend to cast Israel as a greedy, undeserving ward of American largesse, one the U.S. should rein in. “It’s time to act like the big brother or the parent and to say ‘enough is enough and we’re going to take the car keys if you don’t stop driving drunk,’” is how Jeremy Ben-Ami, executive director of the dovish J Street, described the U.S.-Israel relationship in 2008. Those with more sinister intentions, not content with likening Israel to an inebriated teenager, cite U.S. military assistance to Israel as evidence that American Jews want “wars for Israel.” In the early 2000’s, a lucrative intellectual cottage industry sprung up peddling the idea that a nefarious “Israel Lobby” had goaded the United States into war against Iraq. “What these neoconservatives seek is to conscript American blood to make the world safe for Israel,” wrote Pat Buchanan in 2003. The size and advisability of U.S. military aid to Israel, like any appropriation of taxpayer dollars, is fair game. But U.S. assistance to Israel demands far less—in both blood and treasure—than many other American defense relationships around the world. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the United States annually spends roughly $36 billion on military capabilities in Europe, almost 10 times its annual assistance package to Israel. Of course that spending accounts for operations in more than two dozen countries. But those are countries which, unlike Israel, Washington is treaty-bound to defend. Article 5 of the NATO Charter stipulates that “an armed attack against one or more of [its members] in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all,” and that, should such an attack occur, each member undertake “such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force” to defend the embattled ally. At the height of the Cold War, some 400,000 American soldiers were deployed in Europe, ready to risk their lives in case of a Russian invasion, and American soldiers remain stationed (albeit in far fewer numbers) across the continent.  In Asia, the United States has some 30,000 troops based in South Korea, where they lie in easy range of a bellicose, nuclear-armed dictatorship to its north. Roughly 50,000 U.S. soldiers are positioned in Japan. Across the entire Pacific theater, the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force have about 400,000 American soldiers and civilians deployed to contain a rising China, respond to natural disasters, and deter a nuclear-armed Pyongyang. America’s military commitment to its Asian allies, like its commitment to European allies, requires more risk and sacrifice than its arrangement with Israel. Because the post-World War II Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan prohibits the latter from having offensive military capabilities, the U.S. is pledged to protect the nation from attack. The U.S. made a similar pledge to South Korea following a war in which 30,000 Americans died defending it from an invasion by the communist North. (No “American blood” was expended to save Israel when a coalition of Arab armies attacked it in 1948. Indeed, not a single American soldier has ever died defending Israel, something which cannot be said about many of our allies). The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act compels Washington to “maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan.” That stops just short of an outright commitment to defend the island from attack by mainland China but ensures enough strategic ambiguity to keep Beijing at bay. Finally, Israel is hardly the only American ally in the Middle East to receive military aid. Egypt is the second largest non-NATO recipient after Israel, and Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates are beneficiaries as well. Unlike U.S. aid to Israel, most of which is funneled back to the American defense sector, U.S. defense spending towards its forward-operating presence in Europe and Asia is composed of hundreds of thousands of “boots on the ground,” soldiers whose lives would be at stake in any scenario involving an attack on treaty allies. And these allies lie under our nuclear umbrella, meaning that conflicts on either continent could theoretically ensnare the United States in nuclear war. Viewed in this light, U.S. military aid to Israel looks less like the special dispensation of a powerful ethnic lobby and more the logical extension of America’s postwar power projection. It is not all that spectacular compared to U.S. defense arrangements with the dozens of countries it is obliged to defend, up to and including with weapons of mass destruction. Of course, U.S. support for Israel has an emotional dimension, as the passionate speeches at AIPAC invoking the Holocaust attest. But much the same can be said for its military arrangements with Estonia, South Korea, and Taiwan: All are small, vulnerable democracies facing authoritarian, rapacious adversaries, and it is this underdog quality which animates American public support. Yet for some reason, none of these alliances engender anywhere near the same sort of antipathy as does the one between the United States and the world’s only Jewish state.  Americans might not know the precise details of U.S. international assistance packages, but they are familiar with the fundamentals of the Middle East conflict, which is why polls have consistently shown, over decades, overwhelming public support for Israel over its many adversaries. It’s not dollars—or “Benjamins,” as the honorable lady from Minnesota put it—that garner widespread (and generous) American backing for Israel, but common democratic values, religious affinity, and a shared strategic outlook.

# Aurora Cannabis: 4 Logical Brand-Name Partners

If you're a growth-seeking investor, there's no industry that's probably catching your attention more right now than legal marijuana. The duo of Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics have called for global sales growth of 38% in 2019 to $16.9 billion, while Wall Street biggest cheerleader, Cowen Group, has forecast $75 billion in worldwide annual sales by 2030. With growth this robust, there are bound to be quite a few winners in the space. One company that investors seem to be behind in the success category is Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB). Through a combination organic growth projects, joint venture cultivation partnerships, and multiple acquisitions, Aurora looks to be on track to lead all growers with 700,000 kilograms of peak annual output. Being a production leader should help reduce per-gram growing costs as economies of scale take shape, and it'll make Aurora Cannabis a logical choice for long-term supply deals domestically and abroad. Continue Reading Below This is also a company that's done a bang-up job of pushing into international markets. Following the announcement of a 51% equity stake in Gaia Pharm in Portugal, Aurora now has a presence in 24 countries, including Canada. These foreign markets will prove particularly handy if and when domestic Canadian dried flower supply becomes commoditized. In order to avoid margin deterioration, these external sales channels will prove critical in helping Aurora Cannabis to offload its supply. The one thing Aurora lacks: A brand-name partner But the one thing Aurora doesn't have is a brand-name partner. Canopy Growth landed a major investment from Constellation Brands, Cronos Group recently closed on an equity investment from Altria, and Tilray has partnered with both Novartis (through a subsidiary) and Anheuser-Busch InBev. Yet no partner for the largest projected producer in the world, as of yet. However, with the hiring of activist investor Nelson Peltz as a strategic advisor to the company, the expectation is for a partnership opportunity to emerge sometime soon. While these are nothing more than guesses on my part, here are four partnership opportunities for Aurora Cannabis that would, at least on the surface, seem logical. Coca-Cola Advertisement One of the more likely partnership opportunities lies with beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). For those who may not recall, Coca-Cola was reported to be in discussions with Aurora Cannabis this past September about a possible partnership, joint venture, or even an equity stake. With soda sales falling flat in the U.S., Coca-Cola has been exploring new opportunities to drive top-line growth. Presumably, with nonalcoholic cannabis-infused beverages expected to become legal in Canada by this coming October, this would give Aurora and Coca-Cola a means to team up and bring their respective strengths to the table. Coca-Cola ultimately wound up walking away just a few weeks later without a deal, suggesting instead that it would monitor progress for the cannabis industry from the sidelines. My suspicion is that Aurora's equity asking price may have been too high at the time. However, with Peltz leading the charge for strategic opportunities and having a keen understanding of the food and beverage space, I'd have to think that Coca-Cola is back in the picture. Mondelez International Beyond sparkling beverages we have snack food giant Mondelez International (NASDAQ: MDLZ). Mondelez is the company behind such brands as Oreo, Ritz, Chips Ahoy, Triscuit, and Nabisco. With Health Canada outlining its intention of legalizing alternative consumption options come October, it means that edibles will soon find their way to dispensary store shelves. Since edible consumption (at least in the U.S.) has gravitated toward sweets, such as cookies and chocolates, Mondelez's snack lineup would make the perfect pairing for Aurora's tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and/or cannabinol (CBD) products. THC is the psychoactive cannabinoid responsible for getting a user high, whereas CBD is the nonpsychoactive cannabinoid best known for its perceived medical benefits. A big reason Mondelez is a logical partner is that Trian Fund Management, which Peltz founded, owns over 18.8 million shares of Mondelez, and Trian Fund President Peter May is on the company's board of directors. Back in 2014, Peltz unsuccessfully lobbied for PepsiCo to break into separate food and beverage divisions, and have that food division (Frito-Lay) purchase Mondelez. But if Peltz can orchestrate a partnership between Aurora and Mondelez he'll have a nice secondary win, albeit a few years later than expected. Heineken Although it's certainly more of a longshot than either Coca-Cola or Mondelez, global beer giant Heineken (NASDAQOTH: HEINY) would make a lot of sense as a partner for Aurora Cannabis. Last year, Heineken subsidiary Lagunitas Brewing launched a nonalcoholic cannabis-infused beverage designed to taste like beer, called Hi-Fi Hops, in select California dispensaries. Instead of using CBD, which is the most commonly used cannabinoid in the infused beverage market, Heineken's subsidiary chose to produce the beverage in a THC-only and hybrid THC-CBD variety. The point is that Heineken has clear interest in the infused beverage space, and the company would like to expand its footprint in Europe and North America. Partnering with Aurora on a more global scale would get that done. Heineken has a relatively small presence in Canada, where Aurora could lend a hand to increase its brand exposure. Meanwhile, Aurora's recent push into numerous medically legal European countries, and Heineken's considerably stronger market share in Europe, would create an opportunity for Heineken to return the favor. Although not all EU countries allow medical patients to consume infused beverages, this partnership would be a play on legalizations to come in Europe, and potentially even the United States. Roche Finally, the longest shot of all, but nevertheless a logical potential partner, would be global pharmaceutical company Roche (NASDAQOTH: RHHBY). Since Aurora Cannabis will be focusing its attention on higher margin medical marijuana patients, rather than lower-margin recreational weed consumers, it would help to have a global distribution partner in place (like Roche) that can push non-combustible pot products in foreign markets. If this sounds familiar, it's because Tilray has the same deal going with Sandoz, Novartis' generic-drug subsidiary. But why Roche and not some other large pharmaceutical company? While arguably a bit of a stretch to connect the dots, no company offers a broader portfolio of cancer drugs than Roche. From a medical perspective, cannabis is often used as a treatment for cancer pain and/or as a palliative means to improve appetite during cancer treatment. In other words, partnering with Aurora would give Roche a new means with which to improve the overall well-being of cancer patients during treatment, while buffering its bottom line with a global distribution agreement. The big question is, what's next for Aurora Cannabis? 10 stocks we like better than Aurora CannabisWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Aurora Cannabis wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. *Stock Advisor returns as of March 1, 2019<|im_end|>

# The 11 most exciting things on at this year's Vivid Sydney

Vivid Sydney today announced the program for its 11th annual festival, which brings light installations, live music, talks and discussions to Sydney for 23 days over winter. It’s become a major tourist attraction, with more than 2.25 million visitors drawn like moths to the free, mesmerising light shows that shine from 6-11pm each night. The lights will switch on alongside big-name performances and appearances from May 24 to June 15.  Here’s 11 things you need to know about the 11th Vivid program before it all kicks off  1. Academy Award-winning director Spike Lee will talk about race in the media It will be a challenge to explore Spike Lee’s 40-year career in a 90-minute conversion. The renowned African-American director has made important contributions to discourse about race and equality in the media, and has impacted popular culture across generations. An informed film library wouldn’t be complete without Malcom X (1991) and the 2018 Academy Award-winning film BlackKklansman. The Town Hall talk on June 1 will be Lee’s first public appearance in Australia, and he’ll share insights into film-making and social advocacy beyond the big screen. He’ll be joined in conversation by Widjabul and Gidabul woman and one of Sydney's leading arts voices, Rhoda Roberts. Photograph: CC/Anders Krusberg  2. Esther Perel is coming to sort out your love life If you haven’t heard 'Where Should We Begin', the superstar relationship therapist’s hugely popular podcast, you’ll want to brush up before booking tickets to her conversation at City Recital Hall on June 2. The podcast consists of one-off, real-life couples counselling sessions where she breaks down their problems and helps them find solutions. It’s basically Dr. Phil but ten times smarter and less exploitative. For Vivid Sydney, she’ll be talking about modern love and dating in the digital age. And it’s her first visit to Australia, so we can’t wait to hear what she makes of local dating. 3. FKA Twigs is performing for one night only at Carriageworks While we already knew that Aussie three-piece Rüfüs du Sol and classic goth-pop band the Cure would be part of the Vivid music line-up, we're stoked to hear about FKA Twigs joining the party. It's four years since the genre-smashing, avant-garde pop star performed in Sydney, and now she’s returning with a new show (and maybe even some new music). We’re expecting tickets to go quickly for this one as she’s doing just one night at Carriageworks on June 9. But that doesn’t mean they’re going cheap: a ticket will set you back $110. Have your credit card ready this Thursday March 21 at 9am.  4. Björk’s music video director is lighting the Opera House sails Let’s face it: Vivid Sydney is all about the Sydney Opera House sails. Other elements come and go, but it’s images of those sails that go out around the world and rake in the sweet, sweet tourism dollars. This time around, the lighting honour goes to Andrew Thomas Huang, a Los Angeles-based artist who directed several Björk videos. His work for the sails is called ‘Austral Flora Ballet’, and features native flora (which yes, was also the inspiration for the sails last year) and a dancer performing across the sails. 5. Briggs is hosting a massive night of First Nations-led hip hop at the Opera House Briggs is nothing if not versatile. The Shepparton-born Yorta Yorta artist is a rapper, one half of the hip-hop duo A.B. Original, founder of the Indigenous record label Bad Apples, and a writer, comedian and actor to boot. He continues to soar to new heights of creative success, and we’ll get to see his work alongside other Indigenous artists and contemporary hip-hop music makers at Briggs’ Bad Apples House Party. The big night at the Sydney Opera House on May 30 will see Briggs on stage beside electro-soul duo Electric Fields, Northern Territory rapper Birdz, New Zealand’s game-changing hip-hop star David Dallas and many more. 6. The Harbour Bridge will light up with an Indigenous artwork The southern pylon of the Harbour Bridge has been used by Bangarra Dance Theatre for the last few Vivids, and it’ll be home to an Indigenous work again this year. The Sydney Opera House’s head of Indigenous programming Rhoda Roberts (one of our favourite artistic leaders in the city) is creating ‘Eora: Broken Spear’, a projection work that pays tribute to the country which we live upon and its original custodians. 7. We'll score an encore performance by Australia’s Eurovision hopeful, Kate Miller-Heidke She’ll still be gliding on the glittering, theatrical high of Eurovision when she arrives in Sydney for her performance at City Recital Hall on May 29, and we expect Kate Miller-Heidke will blow us away with a globally inspired performance. She’s teaming up with Helpmann Award-winning composer and director Iain Grandage to add some 2019 pizzazz to her heart-melting ’00s hits like ‘The Last Day on Earth’ and ‘Caught in the Crowd’ alongside more pop-meets-opera creations.  8. The AGNSW is boosting its Art After Hours program We’re a big fan of the Art Gallery of NSW’s free Wednesday night art series – with after-hours access to the galleries, live music, workshops and talks. But for Vivid, they’re curating some pretty special nights. Our pick is the ‘Other’ Voices program on June 5, which will feature award-winning poet Omar Musa and artist Abdul Abdullah in conversation with Michelle Law about how their creative work has allowed them to explore issues of identity in Australia. And yes, Musa will be performing some of his poetry live – we promise he’ll blow you away, even if you’re not a poetry person. Later in the night Okenyo will perform some of her signature electric soul. 9. Claudia Nicholson is taking the MCA to Colombia We always love to see one of Sydney’s most exciting artists get a chance to take over a major canvas at Vivid Sydney, and this year we’re most excited about Colombian-born, Sydney-based Claudia Nicholson’s projection on the facade of the Museum of Contemporary Art. She’s best known for her contemporary takes on Colombian traditions; she makes floral arrangements and the colourful ‘alfombra de aserrín’ a traditional carpet-like artwork created painstakingly over several days using sawdust, glitter and pigment. Those artworks will be adapted for a large-scale animation. 10. A horde of 500 fireflies will be buzzing through the Royal Botanic Garden There are only a few bugs that inspire a sense of romanticism – butterflies maybe, or ladybugs for their duds – but there’s something dreamy about fireflies and their glowing gracefulness. That’s probably why Dutch artist collective Toer created 'Firefly Field', a delicate light installation simulating a family of 500 fireflies. It will appear to hover above the ground and show the blinking, light-up ritual of fireflies looking for love during mating season. In reality, it’ll be built on a superfine steel structure with flexing rods that give a mesmerising movement to the installation at the Royal Botanic Garden. 11. Vivid is bringing a snowstorm to Circular Quay... kind of While there are fab performance and artistic elements to Vivid, we have to admit that a big part of the festival is shiny things. If you’re in the market for an internet-breaking Instagram post or a new DP, head to 'Let it Snow' by artist Jing Li. This Circular Quay light installation allows light-seekers to walk through a cloud of LED bulbs which replicate that pumping Thredbo snow machine. The tendrils of light will react to pedestrian movement and the weather, so you’ll really feel like you’re in the tundra once the crowds gather.<|im_end|>

# Nevada Senate Democrats seek annual legislative sessions

Nevada Senate Democrats seek annual legislative sessions March 28, 2019 Democrats in the state Senate have revived an effort to bring annual legislative sessions to Nevada, which is one of the few states that hold sessions every other year. Ten Democratic senators have signed on in support of a resolution that would create a 90-day legislative session in years that end with an odd number and a 60-day session in even-number years. To be approved, the measure would have to pass the Legislature this year and the 2021 Legislature before going to voters for approval. Supporters at a hearing Wednesday argued biennial legislative sessions are outdated and a switch to annual sessions will make the Legislature more responsive. "Our state simply cannot adequately address rapidly changing conditions, a complex budget and policy (matters) by meeting every other year," said Sen. Joyce Woodhouse at a hearing on the resolution Wednesday. "In the past 17 years alone, our general revenue fund has more than doubled." The measure says sessions held in even-number years would "prioritize legislative business" on the executive budget, but also stipulates the Legislature can pass any other bills. Democrats in the Senate have a firm majority in the body. Only three Democratic senators have not signed onto the resolution. Melanie Scheible, one of those lawmakers, declined to comment. Recommended Stories For You The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that Nevada, Texas, Montana and North Dakota are the only states that hold sessions every other year. Opponents on Wednesday told legislators they have concerns the annual sessions will lead to a rise in the amount of legislation. One opponent said annual sessions would lead to bloated government while other person raised fears Nevada would turn into a full-time Legislature. A similar resolution to create annual sessions narrowly passed the Senate last legislative session but did not cross the finish line in the Assembly.

# Webzen eyes America launch for MMORPG MU Origin 2 after success in Asia

The title is the second mobile spin-off from the main series and marries the franchise’s staple combat and characters with greatly enhanced visuals and a more intensive gameplay experience.  Success in key Asia markets  The game first launched in China, where it quickly gained traction and secured itself the number one position on the iOS store.  In South Korea, Webzen reached top spot in the download charts and second place in the top grossing rankings for both iOS and Android. MMORPGs are a hugely popular genre in the South Korean market, but there is heavy competition for the highly lucrative top spots.  Its launch in South-East Asia was similarly successful, once again scaling the charts to reach first place for both iOS and Android.  To help spur on MU Origin 2’s success on mobile, Webzen experimented with its advertising strategy, moving from standard gameplay-focused adverts to whittier, more accessible commercials.  The new approach paid off, with one of the commercials broadcast in South Korea going on to become a finalist in the Seoul Creative Festival 2018’s ‘Non-TV Creative’ category.  Heading Westward  Currently, the closed beta test for North and South America is limited to English text only, though more languages – including Portuguese and Spanish – will feature in the finalised version.  The beta will be playable on Android, while the iOS version will become available upon the game’s official launch.  The beta will run from March 29th to April 7th and all gameplay progress and character data will be wiped at the end of the test.  Come March 29th, users based in North or South America should look for MU Origin 2’s beta on the Google Play Store.<|im_end|>

# Collegium Recommends Transfer Of Judge Pradeep Nandrajog To Bombay High Court

The Supreme Court Collegium has recommended transfer of Chief Justice of Rajasthan High Court, Justice Pradeep Nandrajog, to Bombay High Court. The apex court collegium, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and comprising Justices SA Bobde, NV Ramana, Arun Mishra and RF Nariman, transferred Justice Nandrjog. "Office of the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court would be falling vacant shortly, consequent upon retirement of Justice NH Patil, Chief Justice of that High Court on April 6, 2019. Therefore, appointment to that office is required to be made. The Collegium resolves to recommend that Justice Pradeep Nandrajog, Chief Justice, Rajasthan High Court, be transferred, in the interest of better administration of justice, to Bombay High Court," said a March 28 resolution which was uploaded on Friday. A row had erupted earlier after names of the chief justices of the Rajasthan and Delhi high courts, Justice Nandrajog and Justice Rajendra Menon respectively, were considered by the collegium on December 12, 2018 for elevation, but the deliberation remained inconclusive and one of the members of the collegium, Justice M B Lokur, retired on December 30, 2018. His place in the collegium was taken by Justice Arun Mishra. The new collegium had, on January 10, ignored the prospect of elevation of justices Justice Nandrajog and Menon as apex court judges and recommended names of Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, who were elevated.

# Yoshi's Crafted World review: A great, fuzzy stress ball of a game for kids of all ages

Yoshi’s Crafted World is a great, fuzzy stress ball of a game. For grown-ups, and I use the term loosely, it is a relaxing flutter as a fluffy dinosaur around a saccharine world built out of yarn, cardboard and sticky-back plastic. A calming release after a day’s work or something to reduce the blood-pressure after getting swatted by the latest boss giving you gyp in Sekiro.  For kids, it is an imaginative introduction to side-scrolling platformers. With Yoshi lobbing eggs at shy guys as he bounces from cardboard clouds, hitching a ride on a train made out of buttons and butter tubs, battling with bosses crafted from a beach ball by villainous wizard Kamek.  It is all thoroughly lovely, if unquestionably syrupy, aided by a sense of tangibility that makes the DIY motif more than a visual gimmick. Yoshi trundles along the cardboard walkways, swallowing up shyguys with his tongue to produce eggs which can be thrown at enemies or into the background. Plastic cups with faces drawn on hide collectibles in the distance, spinning away and clattering into other papier mache creations.  It all feels like you are zoomed into a craft box diorama, in which you can literally see the wires from the celebratory lights taped to the back of the end goal’s cardboard. In a ghost house, chairs sweep out spookily, until you notice you can see the attached string poking from the walls pushed along by an unseen hand.  The upshot of all this is that developer Good Feel are not forced into keeping things consistent; allowing them to experiment with one-shot ideas that probably just seemed like a laugh at the time. A giant cobbled together Yoshi punching cardboard targets as it thunders along; a speed-run diving through hoops made of tinsel; ground-pounding an inflatable foot pump on a pirate ship to catapult cannonballs at opposing frigates.  The bulk of the game, though, is based on languid exploration rather than the pinpoint precision of many 2D platformers. Making your way to each goal is a relatively simple task, but you will want to poke and prod at the world around you; uncovering red coins and smiley flowers hidden in nooks and crannies and won in snap challenges.  This is where most of the fun lies, stretching Yoshi’s unique move-set --those eggs, the lashing tongue, the flutter-jump-- to reach the trickier collectibles as Yoshi’s challenge gently creeps up on you.  You can launch eggs into the background and foreground, while at certain moments the world will flip entirely to reveal a coconut shy style challenge on the other side of the screen. The entirety of levels have a flip side, in fact, which you can revisit after completion to track down a small pack of cutesy dogs.  In a way, this kind of thing highlights some of the smartness of Yoshi’s Crafted World, while also showing why it isn’t quite a Nintendo classic. The game is clever and delightful throughout, but often feels like it has good ideas that aren’t quite fully capitalised on. The flipped world is probably the best example, appearing a little too sporadically in main levels and relying on collectibles in the alternative levels.  And as good as hunting out smiley flowers can be, there does feel like a touch too much busywork to pad out proceedings. Finding ‘souvenirs’ is another layer unlocked in certain levels after completion, as is unlocking costumes by spending coins on gacha machines.  It’s these kind of things that just niggle at Yoshi’s Crafted World. But they do not stop it being a gently compelling and charming adventure. If you are put off by some of Nintendo’s more saccharine output, it certainly isn’t the game for you, but kids of all ages looking for a breezy, wholesome distraction will find a lot to like.  Yoshi's Crafted World is released 29 March for Nintendo Switch<|im_end|>

# EDITORIAL: Move fast to revitalise the ailing health sector

Providing universal healthcare is one of four priorities of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration. The others are food security, affordable housing and manufacturing. Access to quality healthcare is a prerequisite for national development. Economic growth is predicated on the health of citizens. It is the healthy who can engage meaningfully in productive ventures. Despite express intention, providing quality health remains a major challenge. A survey conducted by this newspaper across the country and published elsewhere in this edition presents a sorry state of affairs. DEVOLVED The public healthcare system is broken and dysfunctional. Hospitals and dispensaries operate without basic facilities. Drugs and other provisions are sorely lacking. Being sick is a death sentence for many. Constitutionally, healthcare is a function of the national and county governments. The national government’s key responsibility is formulating policy and managing the main referral hospitals, currently Kenyatta and Moi Teaching in Eldoret. Other levels of hospitals are managed by county governments. Devolving medical services to counties was predicated on the premise that since health affects people at the individual level, it is better managed at the grassroots. RESOURCES Some gains have been recorded. Relatively a growing number of hospitals and dispensaries have been upgraded and expanded by county governments. Even so, improvements may have been made on physical structures but what matters most — health personnel, drugs and consumables — have not been addressed. Most health facilities across the counties are short-staffed and even those in service are poorly managed. Which explains the perennial strikes by doctors and nurses. As our reports demonstrate, the resources are inadequate. Worse, the allocated cash hardly serves the purpose. POVERTY For the resources are looted, misused or misdirected. In the circumstances, the sick are left without options. Absence of good medical care in public health facilities means the ordinary citizen has nowhere to turn to for medical care. Private health facilities are unjustifiably expensive. The whole purpose of declaring universal healthcare a priority was to galvanise resources and all the energies to the agenda. What obtains on the ground, however, shows that it is all talk but no action. Some interventions such as the multibillion-shilling leased equipment scheme, deployment of doctors from Cuba, waiver of fees for pregnant women or enrolling everyone to the National Hospital Insurance Fund have not translated into tangible benefits to the population. Except for a few regions like Makueni, which stands out as a textbook case study for universal healthcare, the rest of the country is hurting.<|im_end|>

# Human remains found in Greenville County, sheriff's office says

Greenville County Sheriff's deputies were at the scene Friday of a location where human remains were reported to be found. The human remains were discovered in the 100 block of Lakeside Road and reported around 4:18 p.m. "The investigation is in its early stages, so information is very limited at this time," Lt. Jimmy Bolt of the Greenville County Sheriff's Office said in an email. The Greenville County Coroner's Office is also investigating the findings. Chief Deputy Coroner Kent Dill said his office is working on gathering more information. "We don't have anything yet that we can comment on because we don't know exactly what we got," Dill said Friday night. Anyone with information is asked to call CrimeStoppers at 23-CRIME.<|im_end|>

# What Europe's copyright overhaul means for YouTube, Facebook and the way you use the internet

The European Parliament recently passed sweeping changes to the EU's almost two decades-old copyright rules, and critics are worried it could be a misfire that ultimately results in online censorship.  The aptly-named directive on "Copyright in the Digital Single Market" is all part of the bloc's efforts to update its laws to reflect the challenges posed by the age of information.  First introduced by the European Commission in 2016, the new copyright law contains two particular sections that have attracted heavy scrutiny from activists and internet giants alike: Articles 11 and 13 (or 15 and 17 as they're now numbered after a recent update).  The former is aimed at giving news organizations more protections to ensure they're paid fairly for the dissemination of their stories online. Services like Google News will be under particular pressure, as the rules will mean tech firms need to agree to licenses with publishers to share their articles.  In fact, Google has gone as far as to suggest that it may even be forced to pull its news aggregation platform from Europe as a result of the new legislation.  But the biggest source of worry for the people and companies protesting the new measures by far is Article 13. Currently, the onus is on rightsholders to flag copyright violations with tech firms, who can then take action to pull content if they find it's in breach of copyright.  With the new rules, liability now lies with tech giants to ensure their platforms aren't open to copyright breaches. Detractors have said this would lead to controversial pre-filter systems, where everything from memes to GIFs are blocked from online platforms.  For its part, the European Parliament has said this won't be the case, and that memes, GIFs, hyperlinks and snippets of articles will still be able to be shared freely. But that hasn't allayed the concerns of tech companies, freedom of speech campaigners and regular internet users themselves.<|im_end|>

# Wernick issued veiled threats over SNC standoff, Wilson Raybould says - The Turtle Island News

OTTAWA-Jody Wilson-Raybould secretly recorded a conversation with Michael Wernick in which she claims the country’s top public servant issued veiled threats that she’d lose her job as justice minister if she didn’t intervene to stop the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.  She included the audio recording as part of an additional written submission to the House of Commons justice committee, after testifying orally for nearly four hours about an intense pressure campaign last fall to persuade her to override the director of public prosecutions, who had decided not to offer the Montreal engineering giant a remediation agreement.  Wilson-Raybould testified orally about the Dec. 19 conversation with Wernick, saying she took his warnings that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was determined to halt the prosecution as veiled threats.  She said she believes she was moved out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle because she refused to intervene; she resigned from cabinet a month later.  Wernick has denied threatening Wilson-Raybould or improperly pressuring her.  By the time he appeared for a second time at committee on March 6, Wernick appears to have learned that his Dec. 19 conversation had been recorded.  In response to questions about his recollections about the conversation, he snapped: “I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes.”<|im_end|>

# Carson Kelly waiting patiently for first start with Diamondbacks

LOS ANGELES – The Diamondbacks played their third game of the season on Saturday night. Once again, catcher Carson Kelly will not start. When the Diamondbacks acquired Kelly from the St. Louis Cardinals as part of the Paul Goldschmidt trade in December, they framed his career offensive struggles as a byproduct of getting inconsistent playing time. They said they would give Kelly would more chances to play. That might still be the case – and, seeing as how he was stuck behind Yadier Molina, “more” playing time is a low bar to clear – but Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo didn’t make it sound as if Kelly was in position to get a significant number of at-bats in the near future. “I want that to be a three-headed monster that goes out and bangs the ball when they’re playing and helps limit runs when they’re catching,” Lovullo said, referring to Kelly and fellow catchers Alex Avila and John Ryan Murphy. “I truly believe that we have three really gifted guys that I can’t separate in my mind. I want to give them all equal opportunity the best that I can.” Kelly, who delivered the go-ahead, pinch-hit double in the 13th inning on Friday night, said he doesn’t think he’s in a position similar to St. Louis. “I’m not worried about it,” Kelly said. “We’re three games in. We’ve got a long season to go. Things will play out. When I get my opportunity, I’ve got to go out there and do my best. The time will come.” Lovullo said that, for now, he anticipates 10-game segments to be divided between the three catchers in a 4-3-3 breakdown. He said he wanted Kelly to get his first start on Sunday when he could be paired with right-hander Luke Weaver, a pitcher with whom he is familiar from their time together in St. Louis. “He didn’t catch any of the first three games, but he’s going to find himself catching part of the rotation,” Lovullo said. “How that plays out exactly, I don’t know. I want to see how it all works with each guy as I hand it around. I don’t want him to think he’s here as an extra catcher. He’s going to contribute.” Carson Kelly talks about the bloop double that won the game for the Diamondbacks in the early morning hours on Saturday. Nick Piecoro, azcentral sports Short hops Left-hander Robbie Ray said his lack of command on Friday night – he issued five walks in five innings – likely was due to some first-start adrenaline. “Not necessarily mechanical issues or anything,” he said. “I felt good, but I was missing up a little bit and I think that maybe had to do with nerves.” *Left-hander T.J. McFarland threw a bullpen session on Friday, his third since being shut down early in spring training with shoulder inflammation. Lovullo said McFarland’s progress will be similar to any pitcher going through spring training; that is, he’ll likely face hitters in a simulated environment before pitching in a game situation. *Right fielder Steven Souza Jr. will have knee surgery on Tuesday in Cincinnati. Reds medical director Dr. Timothy Kremchek will perform the procedure. Support local journalism. Subscribe to azcentral.com today.<|im_end|>

# 'To the Ulster fans...I let you down': Stockdale apologises for Champions Cup error

Jacob Stockdale has apologised to Ulster fans after he made what Brian O'Driscoll called an "unforgivable" error. With Ulster leading in their Champions Cup quarter-final against Leinster, Stockdale danced through the opposition defence but let the ball slip as he went to touch it down over the try line. Leinster went on the turn the game back in their favour to secure a 21-18 win. The Ulster winger today took to Instagram to offer a heartfelt apology to the Ulster fan base, telling them they deserve to have a Champions Cup semi-final to look forward to.       View this post on Instagram     I’ve had some incredible highs with Ulster rugby, but unfortunately yesterday was a low for me. Sport can be cruel and sometimes you have to learn your lessons the hard way. To the Ulster fans I just want to say I am sorry, I let you down, the support we had yesterday was truly amazing and you deserve to be looking froward to a European semi final. "I’ve had some incredible highs with Ulster rugby, but unfortunately yesterday was a low for me," Stockdale wrote. "Sport can be cruel and sometimes you have to learn your lessons the hard way. "To the Ulster fans I just want to say I am sorry, I let you down, the support we had yesterday was truly amazing and you deserve to be looking forward to a European semi-final." Speaking after the game, Brian O'Driscoll said on BT Sport that Stockdale should have dived over the line to guarantee the ball was touched down. "He had a fair bit of work to do but this, unfortunately for Jacob Stockdale, is unforgivable," said O'Driscoll. "When you find yourself over the whitewash - yes there's a player dragging out of him maybe looking to get a challenge in - you’ve got to dive. "You've got to guarantee the ball goes down." O'Driscoll added that the risk of a knock-on "tends not to happen, or at least far less frequently, when you dive".  "This, unfortunately for Jacob Stockdale, is unforgivable!" A cruel, cruel blow for Ulster. pic.twitter.com/851lr4WwkM — Rugby on BT Sport (@btsportrugby) March 30, 2019 Ulster coach Dan McFarland refused to blame Stockdale for the defeat and stood by his player. "I know what you want me to say and I'm not going to say that,” he said after he game. "I've been asked four times already the question about Jacob and my answer is that not many players in the world would have beaten that many players to get into that position. "He's disappointed but that's not the reason we lost the game."<|im_end|>

# LOCAL ROUNDUP: Rome soccer takes division at Smoky Mountain Cup

The Rome High boys' soccer team fought to end its spring break on a high note this weekend, playing in the Adidas Smoky Mountain Cup in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. And with a perfect record, the Wolves did just that. Rome escaped win after win at the two-day event, defeating teams from Tennessee and Alabama along the way. The Wolves finished 3-0 and won their division. Alex Cornejo got Rome off to a good start on Friday, scoring both goals in his team's 2-0 win over Science Hill (Tenn.). The Wolves earned another shutout to start Saturday, defeating Page (Tenn.) 2-0, and then edged out a 2-1 win over Huntsville (Ala.) in the division finals. Rome (13-2) continues its season Tuesday with a non-region match at Darlington. GOLF: Rome 4th at Lions Classic The Rome High golf team was in Carrollton on Saturday and finished fourth out of 20 teams at the Lions Classic at Oak Mountain Golf Club. The Wolves finished with a team score of 341 in the 18-hole tournament. Hogan Ingram shot a 76 to tie for fifth on the individual leaderboard. The sophomore shot a 38 on the front nine. Barrett Cowan was next with an 80 for the Wolves, while Daniel Davis finished with his best score in a tournament with an 88. Rome is back on the links Monday at Stonebridge Golf Club in a match with Armuchee, Model and Coosa. COLLEGE BASEBALL: Berry splits with BSC The series-opening doubleheader between Berry and Birmingham-Southern was a tale of two different games as the visiting Viking won the first game 17-0 before coming up short, 3-2, in the second game. Berry won the opener of the Southern Athletic Association series after racking up 14 hits and getting help from pitcher Ben Coker to end the game after seven innings. Spence Johns went 3-for-5 with four RBIs and three runs scored for the Vikings, while Quinn Smith also went 3-for-5, scoring two runs and getting an RBI. Casey Whitaker went 2-for-3 with two RBIs and a run scored. Weston Bray and Zach Huie each had two RBIs for the Vikings as well. Coker (3-1) threw a complete game, finishing with five hits, three walks and three strikeouts. A three-run third inning would be all the offense the host Barons would need in Game 2 as Berry managed just one more run after the rally. Johns went 2-for-2 with a walk and two RBIs to lead the Vikings. Berry (19-8, 8-3 SAA) will complete the weekend series with Birmingham-Southern this afternoon.<|im_end|>

# PJ Washington NBA Draft: Mocks, Stock & Projections

Much has been made about PJ Washington’s injury, but the Kentucky big man is firmly in the first round of the NBA draft. Washington could return to Kentucky for his junior season, but the Wildcats big man is a potential lottery pick. This likely means his time in Lexington will be finished at the end of the season. Our latest NBA mock draft has Washington going No. 14 to the Celtics. Washington is in the range of being a late lottery pick. The Kentucky big man missed the Wildcats first two games of the NCAA tournament, and head coach John Calipari admitted he felt the team would have lost in the Sweet 16 without Washington. “It’s good to have PJ back,” Calipari noted to USA Today. “We don’t win the game today without him. We don’t. What he did and how – the presence that he adds to the game and his ability to pass and do different things, and you’re not going to bow guard him, not going to muscle him. You’re not going to push him around.” What do NBA teams like about Washingon? The Kentucky big man has a back-to-the-basket game but can also step outside to knock down jumpers. Washington has a 7’3” wingspan that could make him a threat defensively in the NBA, per The Athletic. ESPN’s latest NBA mock draft has Washington going No. 13. The Athletic’s Sam Vecenie has Washington going No. 19 in his mock draft. Washington Has a Chance to be an NBA Lottery Pick Washington has made huge strides to improve his game from his freshman to sophomore seasons. Washington averaged 14.8 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1.2 blocks this season. ESPN provided an overview of Washington’s game in a brief scouting report. Washington compares physically to Rudy Gay, Jerami Grant, and Kawhi Leonard. Taking into account his athletic testing results brings up the name Noah Vonleh as his top comp.  Washington has enviable physical tools and will almost certainly hear his name called in the first round if he can find a way to use his tremendous measurements to better perform defensively and on the glass, which didn’t happen consistently enough as a freshman. Washington is shooting 41.9 percent from the three-point line. Washington’s offensive game combined with his defensive potential could make the Kentucky big man a double-double threat at the next level. Vecenie suggested the Jazz could be a potential fit for Washington. The Jazz don’t really have a true 4-man on the roster. Most of the time, they play either Derrick Favors next to Rudy Gobert in a dual center look, or they’ll play small with someone like Jae Crowder, Thabo Sefolosha, or Royce O’Neale down there. With Favors and Sefolosha hitting free agency, it would be an interesting decision for Utah to bring in a player that can play a more traditional inside-out game. Washington is tough and physical, but long and quick as well at 6-7 with a 7-3 wingspan. He’s hitting shots from the outside at a high clip, which is something Utah values from that position. This would be a strong fit. My sense is Washington will go in the No. 12-15 range in the upcoming draft, assuming he declares. It will be interesting to see if the Kentucky big man can improve his draft stock even more with his play in the NCAA tournament.<|im_end|>

# ‘Surviving’ with yoga: class gives families of murder victims a chance to heal

TUCSON, AZ (KOLD News 13) - Each Saturday, yogis at Yoga Oasis stretch through any stressful situation. Instructor Alexandra Gastelum leads her class through different exercises.  "When I'm on my mat, nothing else matters," said Gastelum. "I'm present with my body, with myself."  It's that feeling of relief she'd like those in her class to take with them, too.  "I can see a shift in their energy just from walking into the room and leaving class," she said.  For people in her Saturday morning class, though, the most important parts aren't the poses.  It's just remembering to breathe.  Each week, Healing through Yoga helps people like Elizabeth Martinez.  "It's hard to focus on ourselves," explained Martinez, whose sister was killed in a murder suicide. "We are too focused on trying to survive."  In the class, she took a moment for herself.  Even decades later, she still remembers the trauma of her sister's murder.  She spent lots of time figuring life out after her sister was killed.  Being a mother to three kids and helping raise her sister's children were among her responsibilities.  "We have all this anxiety up here (her hand over her chest) and our world is shattered," Martinez explained. "It's not safe anymore."  The Healing through Yoga class is a safe space for survivors.  Outside of the walls, their stories of survival are often taboo.  "People don't want to hear our stories," Martinez said. "People don't know what to say to us, which is okay."  Since Gastelum started teaching the class last year, she's seen powerful change with some of her students.  "There was a complete release. The tears were coming," Gastelum remembers of one student. "That's exactly what she needed in that moment. It it was the first time she'd actually been able to cry."  Release in a room where the details aren't always necessary and the only important goal is to heal together.  “This is a place where it’s okay,” said Martinez.  Healing through Yoga is a free class held weekly at Yoga Oasis.  It's free for anyone who lost a loved one to murder.  The class runs from 10:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. every Saturday at the Yoga Oasis off of Congress Street.  More details can be found at Homicide Survivors Facebook page.<|im_end|>

# Clashes between Iraqi forces and IS along Syria border

BEIRUT – A Syrian monitoring group and an Iraqi official say clashes have erupted on the Syrian-Iraqi borders between Islamic State group militants and Iraqi Shiite fighters as the extremist group defends its last stronghold in the region. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says Saturday that IS militants repelled an attack by members of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces, a paramilitary group of Shiite fighters with Iraqi security forces. The Observatory says the attack took place inside Syria near the border town of Boukamal. Spokesman for Iraq's Kataeb Hezbollah militia, Jaafar al-Husseini, tells The Associated Press his forces clashed with IS from Qaim, the Iraqi border town reclaimed from IS Friday. Al-Husseini says his militia fired rockets inside Syria but didn't cross. His militia built berms along the border to prevent militants from sneaking back.<|im_end|>

# MLB hitters set record for most home runs in single month

It's not exactly breaking news at this point, but there have been a ton of home runs in baseball this year - a record-breaking amount, to be more precise. Entering Friday, the final day of May, MLB players needed to hit 25 home runs to set the record for most dingers hit in a month. That's exactly happened when the Blue Jays' Vladimir Guerrero Jr. went deep in Colorado for his sixth home run of the season. In all, 1,130 home runs have been hit across MLB in the month. The record-breaking May immediately followed a prolific March/April period in which 1,144 home runs were hit.  Players have hit 2,274 home runs through 1,687 games, an average of 1.34 home runs per game - they're on pace to break the record of 1.26 per game set in 2017 . The Twins led the long-ball charge in May with a near-historic month of their own. Minnesota hit 56 home runs in the month, two short of tying the 1987 Orioles and 1999 Mariners for the single-month mark.<|im_end|>

# Bad weather closes all roads between Christchurch and Picton

People driving between Christchurch and Picton have been told to stay put with the weather blocking all routes between the centres. The risk of rock fall has closed part of State Highway One south of Kaikōura. The Lewis Pass on State Highway Seven was closed but has just opened again. New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) said people travelling between Picton and Christchurch should put a halt to their plans. State Highway 73 through Arthur's Pass is also closed due to whiteout conditions. Meanwhile, Gales and a southerly change are forecast for central and northern New Zealand. The strong winds are due to affect Hawke's Bay south of Hastings, Tararua District, Wairarapa, Wellington, Kaikōura Coast and Banks Peninsula, MetService said. Early on Saturday fire services said they had 25 weather-related calls overnight for minor flooding in the North Canterbury towns of Woodend, Kaiapoi and Rangiora. Christchurch recorded 50mm of rain over 12 hours. MetService is warning of heavy rain due on the Kaikōura Coast, along with gale southerlies. Heavy snow is also expected in the area north of Mt Cook and about the Kaikōura ranges above 400 metres. Many South Island roads have had snow or are getting affected by heavy rain. Dunedin police have sounded the alarm as "brass monkey" weather created a perfect storm for carnage on the roads this holiday weekend, the Otago Daily Times reported. "That extra 20kmh over the limit is only going to get you to the next car ahead of you faster," Senior Sergeant Craig Dinnissen said. "Passing lanes aren't drag strips. We don't want to be telling your loved ones you aren't coming home again." Murky and rainy conditions in some parts of the South and the large number of motorcycles on the roads for the Brass Monkey Rally could create a perfect storm for crashes, and police would be out in force this weekend, Mr Dinnissen said. "Plan for a long trip home. If you're running late, just be late." NZTA said a strong wind warning on the Remutaka Hill (State Highway Two) north of Wellington had been lifted. MetService meteorologist Kyle Lee said it was likely to stay cold for much of the Queen's Birthday weekend before warming briefly in the North Island on Tuesday. He said May was a few degrees warmer than usual but temperatures looked to drop back to normal for this time of year.<|im_end|>

# I want to restore fun, hope and a sense of dignity to long-term care

First Person is a daily personal piece submitted by readers. Have a story to tell? See our guidelines at tgam.ca/essayguide.  Rolling her wheelchair down the narrow crowded halls, Daisy is heard before she is seen, “Please? Please? Puleeeeease!!!”  Half of her fellow residents ignore her, while the other half yell at her to shut up. Most of the staff pass by her as if she is invisible, immune to her constant quest for validation. I feel her pain. She’s putting words to what I’ve been feeling almost daily since I began working at this long-term care home. Three months in, I’m no more settled into my new work environment than she is, and this is a place she calls home.  I’ve transferred from a modern facility with a much more vibrant climate, I’m not used to these crowded hallways lined with residents staring blankly at one another or wheeling about aimlessly for lack of anything better to do. I can’t get used to the cockroaches scurrying across the floor of this 45-year-old building despite frequent fumigations, and I know that if something doesn’t change soon, I’m the one who’s going to be crying out, “Puleeeeease!!!”  With no success, I’ve been looking for a resident who’s willing to stand up from their wheelchair and go for a walk. Most are either too tired, already asleep or just not interested. Resigned, I look over at Daisy and sigh. I have an idea.  “Daisy,” I interrupt mid-holler. “Do you like candy?”  “Yeeeeees.”  I inquire of the registered nurse, “Does Daisy have diet restrictions? Is she diabetic?”  “No, she has a regular diet, but the snack cart is coming around soon. She’d be better off to have the muffin.”  I roll my eyes and look back at Daisy. “How old are you Daisy?”  “I’m 87,” she answers proudly.  I shrug. “Kinda sounds like she’s of age. Come on Daisy, we’re going for candy.” The nurse just shakes her head.  I wheel a victorious Daisy onto the elevator in our search of our Holy Grail. On the first floor it’s quieter and so is Daisy. I position her chair in front of the vending machine so she can get a good look at the selection.  “I have a pocketful of change, Daisy; pick what you’d like.”  She scans the forbidden fruit hidden behind the glass and then points an arthritic finger at her selection.  “You want the peanut butter cups?” I ask.  Her eyes light up and she responds, “Oh yes, please!”  She watches as I put the coins, one by one, into the machine. Her face lights up as her treat drops down from its slot.  With peanut butter cups in hand, I push her wheelchair out onto the patio.  “Let’s blow the dust off, Daisy!” She makes no protest, which is a first. Normally, she’d holler bloody murder if you tried to take her out of the building. Progress.  I find a spot for us at a table with a cheerful yellow umbrella. Curiously, she watches me unwrap the peanut butter cup and leans forward in anticipation.  I hand her the treat and caution her to take small bites.  “Slowly, Daisy!” but she gobbles it down in two seconds.  Noisily licking her fingers, she watches me savour my cup. “Wanna share the last one?” I ask as I fold up the paper wrapper.  “Yes please.” Her eyes widen as she eagerly awaits the sugary treat.  I try to break it into even halves but I end of with the smaller of the two pieces. Oh well. This time she inhales it in one bite. As if a moment of happiness can be snatched from her hand, she has lost her ability to delay gratification. She’s become a product of her environment. A product that I’m sure Daisy would despise if she could even recognize it.  This is something I’ve given much thought to lately in my job as I wade through the crowded hallways, human train wrecks blocking my passage at every turn. Is this how any of these people envisioned their lives? Retired teachers, engineers, homemakers staring numbly at one another or defiantly wheeling into your path for no other reason than for you to acknowledge them.  "I was somebody important once, you know,” is spoken in a stare.  “I raised five children on my own. I kept them fed and clothed without anyone’s help,” a widow’s eyes scream in indignation.  “Just love me.” Is buried in Daisy’s “pleeeeease.”  So I do. I love on, and acknowledge Daisy and all the others who are struggling along with me, for meaning and purpose in our fragile lives. To be seen and known validates our existence. It makes the statement, “I see you. I honour your life.”  I lean back in my chair and watch Daisy take in her surroundings. Faded blue eyes squint as she looks up at a perfect blue summer sky. Her white hair that reminds me of a dandelion gone to seed, is being gently tousled in the breeze but it doesn’t bother her. She’s quiet. I sit across from her feeling the warm sun on my face and I let out a sigh. This is glorious. I’m not at my desk doing my actual job right now, but I’m doing what matters – at least to Daisy.  Maybe I’m a slow learner or maybe it’s because I’m over 50 – closer to the age of those living in long-term care – but I’ve finally figured out that I don’t want to be part of creating policies and procedures. I want to be part of creating joy and savouring memories. It’s simply not enough to help my residents maintain the last vestiges of independence. While this is what I’m paid to do as a restorative care co-ordinator, and I recognize that it does have its place, I am getting less and less satisfaction from it as I watch other things like provincial standards and quality indicators constructed by people void of any emotional investment, take first place. Truly, what profit is it to gain the whole world but lose your own soul?  There’s a book by Jonas Jonasson that tells a story of an elderly man who, on the eve of his 100th birthday, decides that the prospect of spending another year in a nursing home is untenable. He escapes and the story that ensues tells of one ridiculous adventure after another. While some critics found the story to be unbelievable and too far-fetched, I found it to be simply enchanting. If I had been written into the story, I would have been his accomplice – the one helping him bust out of the nursing home.  While I may not be in a position to help residents permanently bust out of long-term care, I can provide a temporary escape. And where does the restorative piece fit in? Easy. I am restoring fun, hope and a sense of dignity. Oh please, let there be dignity.  Monica Catto lives in Mississauga, Ont.<|im_end|>

# An explosion devastated Garner a decade ago. Now Amazon is coming, and so are new families.

An explosion that killed 4 at a food plant rocked Garner a decade ago  Assembly lines rolled along as usual that day, cutting and packaging Slim Jims that would be shipped to grocery stores and gas stations around the world.  But things went terribly wrong at the ConAgra manufacturing plant in Garner the morning of June 9, 2009. An explosion sparked by natural gas rocked the sprawling facility, sending workers rushing toward the exits and toppling part of the building onto cars parked outside.  Four people died and dozens more were injured, some with severe burns.  The blast seemed to further unite this small, blue-collar Wake County town, where meat snacks were produced off Jones Sausage Road for four decades and neighbors gathered for high school football games on Friday nights.  Local restaurants provided meals for hundreds of ConAgra workers affected by the explosion, and community members visited injured workers in the hospital.  “It pretty much defined Garner, I think,” said longtime Mayor Ronnie Williams. “It brought out the best in people.” In the 10 years since the blast, Garner has done a lot of growing up. That was especially apparent last summer, when Amazon announced its plans to build a distribution center at the former ConAgra site. The facility, which is expected to employ 1,500 people, is set to open this fall. But even before Amazon, Garner saw change. Cabela’s, the popular outdoor recreation store, opened in 2015 in the White Oak shopping center, prompting more restaurants and stores to open near Interstate 40 and U.S. 70. Garner High School, long known for its outdated buildings where air conditioners failed and water leaked through roofs, underwent a major renovation. A second high school — South Garner — opened to new students last fall to help relieve overcrowding.    The squat and dark town hall was replaced by a two-story brick building with big windows. A long-hoped-for recreation center is set to open soon downtown.  And who can forget Scotty McCreery, Garner’s favorite son? McCreery was still in high school when he won “American Idol” in 2011, bringing national attention to the town and his beloved Trojan baseball team. But perhaps most telling is that new families, finally, are moving here.  More affordable homes  Garner and other eastern Wake towns have not seen the explosive growth over the years that has come to Cary and the rest of the western side of the county. But Garner grew 6 percent last year and now has a population of about 30,500. It was the 13th fastest-growing town in North Carolina in 2018, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. As home prices in the Triangle have soared, more buyers have looked to towns like Garner for more affordable options, said Stacey Anfindsen, a real estate market analyst for Triangle Multiple Listing Service. The average closing price of homes in Wake County over the past year was about $354,000, Anfindsen said. That compares to $260,000 in Garner.  Sources: U.S. Census Bureau and Wake County Revenue Department  Josh and Tabitha Cooke, both 30, said they moved to a new subdivision in Garner after a year of searching for a Wake County home they could afford.  “Everything else was kind of junky,” Josh Cooke said of other homes in their price range. The couple has two young children, and they like that their neighbors also have kids. Their commutes are about 15 minutes — she attends Campbell Law School in downtown Raleigh, and he works as a physical therapist in Raleigh’s Cameron Village. “There’s character here, but then you’re so close to downtown,” Tabitha Cooke said. Kyle Hodges, 23, moved to Garner last August and works at Full Bloom Coffee Roasters on Main Street. A graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill, Hodges said this is the first time he’s lived in a small town. Hodges said he likes to go to restaurants in downtown Raleigh, but he also enjoys the down-home southern cooking at Angie’s Restaurant and Toot-N-Tell in Garner. “Once you find the hidden gems of the area, it can really be a nice place to live,” Hodges said of the town. At Toot-N-Tell, just down the road from Full Bloom, 83-year-old customer Betty Heath said she didn’t realize Garner “could get this big.”  But Heath, who has spent most of her life in Garner, said progress was inevitable.  “I’ve always liked the people and the smallness of the town,” Heath said. “I don’t like a big town. I don’t like the activity.”  Amazon on the way  Garner has clearly come a long way, but there are still obstacles to overcome. Schools in eastern Wake have historically lagged behind other Wake County schools when it comes to test scores. In Garner, five of the town’s 11 schools failed to meet academic growth standards during the 2017-18 school year. When ConAgra left Garner two years after the explosion, the city lost a company that had once employed 900 people and brought in $50 million of tax revenue.  ConAgra gave the fire-scarred site off I-40 to the town, and Garner leaders wanted to recruit bio-pharmaceutical companies to the property. They figured high-paying jobs would lure developers to build more-expensive homes.  But biotech didn’t bite. The economy was still recovering from the recession, and the site had some environmental issues, said Joe Stallings, Garner’s economic development director.  “When Amazon came along,” he said, “it actually checked a lot of boxes.”    Some welcome news came last fall, when Amazon said it was raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour. That means most of the new jobs in Garner will pay more than $30,000 a year. And while some town leaders might not have envisioned a distribution company at the site, Stallings said Amazon will create more jobs and tax revenue than ConAgra did.  Since Amazon announced its plans, the town has heard from other interested developers and businesses — “everything from manufacturing to more distribution,” Stallings said.  The N.C. Department of Transportation wants to extend the Triangle Expressway through Garner and eastern Wake, which would inevitably bring more growth as commuters would have an easier route to Research Triangle Park.  And Raleigh has plans to spruce up South Saunders Street, which connects the city’s downtown to Garner. What does it all mean? Probably more jobs, officials say, and more young families like the Cookes. Tabitha Cooke said she and her husband realized Garner was the right place for them. That small-town feel might not last forever, though.  “I think other people are starting to figure it out,” she said.  Staff writer David Raynor contributed to this report.<|im_end|>

# Concert review: Lionel Richie gets mighty mighty at Daily's show

Lionel Richie made a killing in the 1980s with a string of piano ballads that sold a million copies and inspired a million prom-night slow dances. So it's easy to forget how funky the guy could be. Richie played all of those ballads Saturday night at Daily's Place in Jacksonville — "Penny Lover," "Truly," "You Are." But he also spent a good deal of his time calling back to his days with the Commodores, one of the finest funk bands of the '70s. "Brick House" and "Lady (You Bring Me Up)" steamed up a venue already so warm that Richie called it “the nastiest show I’ve ever played.” He threw so many towels into the crowd that he asked his assistant to cut them into smaller pieces. He’s also got an astonishing songbook to work from. When a guy walks onstage and breaks into “Easy,” you’d think there would be no place to go but downhill from there. But Richie has a catalog deep enough to play 19 songs with no throwaways in the setlist. Nearly half of his songs were from his Commodores days (including an impressive run through “Three Times a Lady,” “Sail On,” “Fancy Dancer” and “Sweet Love”), but Richie didn’t forget about the mid-‘80s monster hits – “Running With the Night,” “Stuck on You,” “Dancing on the Ceiling,” “Say You, Say Me.” The fireworks from the Jumbo Shrimp game across the parking lot started during the tender opening notes of “Hello,” but reached a big finale right as the song did, bringing a big smile to Richie’s face. Of course he couldn’t leave out his two signature songs from the ‘80s: “Endless Love” (with the ladies in the audience filling in the Diana Ross parts) and “We Are the World” (with Richie filling in all the non-Richie parts). Richie is in the middle of a big comeback, with a live album/DVD about to be released and a tour taking him on the road all summer. It’s a comeback that’s long overdue for a guy who the songs to keep you going, well, all night long.<|im_end|>

# Echo Fox to start Yusui and Lost in week one of the 2019 LCS Summer Split | Dot Esports

Echo Fox is making a couple of changes to its LCS roster for week one of the 2019 Summer Split. David “Yusui” Bloomquist is in for mid laner Kim “Fenix” Jae-hoon, while bot laner Lawrence “Lost” Hui will be subbing in for Apollo Price. The team had a better-than-expected showing in the Spring Split with Fenix and Apollo, nabbing a playoff spot after a tough start. That makes this an interesting experiment to start the Summer Split. Echo Fox has yet to reveal whether the changes will stick or the reasoning behind them. None of the four players revealed anything on their official Twitter accounts. Yusui is a player who’s been in the Academy scene for some time. He’s been on the Echo Fox Academy team for a year and is one of few North American players starting in the mid lane in week one. Lost, a native New Zealander, came to Echo Fox via the OPL. Bot lane wasn’t a strength of the team in the Spring Split, so this experiment makes sense. And he’s played in the LCS for the team before. But it’s fascinating that the team would continue to try Lost since he takes up a valuable import slot. Lost and Yusui will get their chance to prove their worth in Echo Fox’s first game of the week vs. Golden Guardians on June 1 at 8pm CT.<|im_end|>

# David Rawlings

Beginning with the 1996 debut of his musical partner Gillian Welch, David Rawlings has quietly become an Americana guitar hero, flatpicking his ’35 Epiphone Olympic across Welch’s five critically acclaimed albums and his own solo records. The latest of these, and his third solo outing, finds Rawlings revisiting the neo-traditionalist roots that first won the duo attention.  Which is not to say this album is bereft of post-war modernity. “Cumberland Gap” (ironically, a Lomax-collected Civil War tune) sits comfortably at Uncle Neil’s knee, with its minor-key “Ohio” riff and big-barn solo, while the sleepy fade-in and beautiful bed of keys on “Guitar Man” evoke The Band.  But it’s the old-timey stuff where Rawlings and company, including Welch and fiddler Brittany Haas, really wow. The wry humor of “Yup” just might remind one of the first time they heard Doc Watson’s rendition of “Tennessee Stud.” And like other tradition-leaning tracks on the record, “Money Is The Meat In The Coconut” mines the child-like innocence of folkways in a guileless fashion that avoids academic condescension, paying homage while reminding us of the joys to be found in the music that inspired A.P. Carter to walk untold miles.  This article originally appeared in VG January 2018 issue. All copyrights are by the author and Vintage Guitar magazine.

# ‘MasterChef Junior’ finalist Malia Brauer makes it to the Top 3

Malia Brauer was bursting with joy when she found out she was headed for the “MasterChef Junior” finale.  But before the news came, the 12-year-old girl from Newhall was just trying to keep her cool.  She was “really nervous” as she stood alongside her fellow competitors Reid, Sadie and Aaron awaiting the judges’ decision after the elimination round Tuesday, May 28, she said in a phone interview.  Only three kids would earn a spot in next week’s finale, and Ivy had just joined Che who had already secured his place in the earlier challenge.  Che also got to assign the remaining contestants a different fruit with which to create a restaurant-worthy dish, leaving Malia with peaches.  “I’ve made a peach pie before but that’s really it,” she said. “I feel like I just really needed to elevate it and do a ‘peaches and cream’ with a lot of different components.”  Malia’s peach dish included buttermilk biscuits, candied macadamia nuts and an orange blossom whipped cream that judge Christina Tosi not only called her “best-looking dish” but “a dish I could imagine in the MasterChef finale.”  Gordon Ramsay added, “It’s an accomplished dish” but said he would have liked more peaches.  In the end, Mallia made the cut. But she also knew she was up against accomplished cooks.  Even Ramsay said, “The decisions come down to the tiniest, and I mean tiniest, of details.”  MasterChef Junior Finale  When: 8 p.m. Tuesday, June 4  Where: Fox<|im_end|>

# Smokey the Bear Was a 2019 Met Gala Surprise Sideshow Star

We turn to the annual Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute Benefit for the fashion and celebrities. But this year, the 2019 Met Gala also featured an unexpected guest in the area: none other than Smokey the Bear, the anthropomorphic character who serves as the icon for the U.S. Forest Service in their long-running advertising campaign to protect the wilderness from human-caused fires. Since 1944, Smokey the Bear — officially named Smokey Bear — has been featured in ads warning campers about taking care of the wilderness and preventing fires. And now he’s become part of this year’s “camp” gala, too.  “I had to be there,” Smokey explained to TIME. “Being so close to Central Park, I wanted to make sure that there would not be any forest fires. I heard that the Met Ball would be on fire this year!”  Smokey arrived at the Met chauffeured by a human in a bicycle cab, and appeared outside of the gala’s entrance to mingle. Onlookers seemed unsure what to make of the giant furry creature in the midst of the glitz and glamour of the night, which featured stars like Lady Gaga making four outfit changes on the carpet, and Billy Porter showing up on a litter carried by six attendants. Then again, the zaniness of Smokey’s presence is in its own way exactly on-theme for “camp” — although Smokey might fit in more with the backwoods definition of the term than its fashion and taste counterpart.<|im_end|>

# Ghost Ship trial: Big takeaways after prosecution rests its case

Prosecutors in the Ghost Ship criminal trial rested their case before a jury Wednesday, buttoning up four-plus weeks of methodical testimony in which they sought to show that the two defendants were negligent in throwing a party at an unsanctioned Oakland warehouse before a blaze broke out and killed 36 people.  Autrey James and Casey Bates, prosecutors for the Alameda County district attorney’s office, called to the stand dozens of witnesses — fire survivors, victims’ family members, warehouse tenants, investigators, and police and fire personnel — to drive home one key point: Those who died on Dec. 2, 2016, had “no notice, no time and no exits.”  At stake is the freedom of Derick Almena, 49, and Max Harris, 29, who are both charged with 36 counts of involuntary manslaughter, one for each person killed. Prosecutors have said that Almena, the master tenant of the Ghost Ship warehouse, and Harris, the artists collective’s creative director, ran day-to-day operations in the space and were responsible for overseeing the deadly conditions up until a fire broke out during an electronic music concert.  Cinda Stoddard, an investigator with the district attorney’s office, testified Wednesday that Harris sent emails in which he referred to himself as the “executive director” of the warehouse. Prosecutors seemed intent on focusing on Harris’ role in the fire to close their case, after spending much of the first few weeks documenting Almena’s role as master tenant.  A charge of involuntary manslaughter requires proof that an unintentional death resulted from unlawful actions, or decisions made “without due caution.”  Defense attorneys have used their cross-examinations to set the stage for their own case, which will begin next week. Almena’s attorneys, Tony Serra and Brian Getz, and Harris’ co-counsels, Curtis Briggs and Tyler Smith, will argue that officials who were trained to spot safety hazards failed in their duties, and that prosecutors discounted evidence that the blaze could have been ignited by arsonists.  Below are the key takeaways from the first half of the Ghost Ship criminal trial:  No time to escape  A common theme in testimony from prosecutor witnesses who made it out of the Ghost Ship warehouse fire was the lack of time. Tenants and partygoers offered harrowing accounts of the fire’s speed and ferocity, recalling how the blaze needed just seconds to go from smoke to a full-blown inferno.  “When I saw the glow, I had a feeling I wouldn’t make it out,” said Jonathan Axtell, a witness who attended the electronic music show.  Prosecutors repeatedly asked witnesses about missing safety features, inferring that sprinkler systems or fire and smoke alarms could have given victims crucial seconds to flee.  No cause given  The most obvious omission from prosecutors’ case is a definitive cause of the fire. Though fire investigators never made an official determination, Oakland Fire Marshal Maria Sabatini testified during last year’s preliminary hearing that she believed an electrical failure sparked the blaze.  Prosecutors never asked Sabatini for this opinion when she testified in the trial, and this was likely strategic. For the state’s case, the cause of the fire is beside the point. Instead, the warehouse’s conditions — flammable wood, tapestries, makeshift stairs and nearly no safety equipment — made the space an unsafe tinderbox, prosecutors said.  No evidence of arson  Prosecutors used some of the witnesses’ testimony as a pre-emptive strike against the defense’s suggestion that Molotov cocktail-toting arsonists torched the warehouse. Though they didn’t dwell on the issue for more than a few questions, prosecutors asked several investigators if there was any evidence or correct conditions for the explosive devices. The answer was always no.  During cross-examinations, the defense challenged these investigators’ credentials and successfully got them to admit that they couldn’t definitively rule out arson.  No single strategy  Prosecutors took two different tracks when arguing why Almena and Harris are responsible for the deadly fire. Their case against Almena focused on instances from years before the fire, when he mocked suggestions to make the space safer and lied to investigators about people living in the warehouse. Later in the trial, investigators testified about Harris’ role, citing emails, interviews and Tinder app messages in which he called himself the manager or executive director of the space.  No easy answers  Every so often, witnesses for the prosecution appeared to give defense attorneys an opening. Many of Ghost Ship’s tenants and visitors testified that they never thought of the space as unsafe, and at least one witness said she felt safe because officials had visited in the past.  The defense team additionally seized on testimony from first responders at the scene. In a testy exchange with Oakland Battalion Chief Heather Mozdean, Briggs challenged why firefighters didn’t ask partygoers whether victims were inside the warehouse.  “I have gone over and over this fire in my head a million times,” Mozdean said, crying on the stand. “I can’t think of anything we could have done better. … That is so hard.”  Defense attorneys also argued that police and fire inspectors who visited the warehouse before the fire failed to report any dangerous conditions.  What’s next  Defense attorneys are scheduled to begin calling witnesses next week, and both Almena and Harris will testify, according to their attorneys.

# Painting on silk workshop with Inga Strause-Godejord

Instructor Inga Strause-Godejord will teach the basic approaches to silk painting in a Painting on Silk Workshop on Thursday, June 20, from 7:00 PM-9:30 PM at the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center, 5601 S. Braeswood. In this workshop, participants will create delicate and dynamic patterns of color and texture on silks and will take home a small frameable landscape-based silk painting.  “Unlike some types of dyes, those provided in class can be set with a regular household iron, making this an easier and much safer method for these techniques,” stated Strause-Godejord.  Strause-Godejord graduated from the Applied Art College, Design Department (1989) and received her Bachelor’s degree in painting from the Riga Academy of Arts (1995). Having lived in Norway, Canada and the U.S. for many productive years, she now lives in Houston, working in her home studio.  In her words: “I have been painting with dyes on silk for many years and can’t wait to get to my studio each day. Working with silk dyes gives me the freedom to create paintings that are vivid in color and sophisticated in detail.”  Get creative, bring friends and unwind. Fee for the workshop is $40 (includes supplies). To register online or for complete listings of classes, visit erjcchouston.org/art or call 713-551-7217.

# Security forces in Sudan carry out raids across capital, killing at least 3

NAIROBI — A long-feared confrontation between state security forces and protesters occupying part of Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, appeared to be underway early Monday morning, as heavy gunfire was heard around the city and a doctors’ group affiliated with the protest said at least three were killed by live ammunition.  A broad swath of Sudanese society has staged a sit-in in Khartoum since April 6, just days before the military toppled former president Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who had led the country for 30 years. Tens of thousands of protesters remained in place after his ouster to demand civilian control over the transitional period in this North African country of 40 million.  The so-called Transitional Military Council, or TMC, has pushed back on those demands, insisting on retaining ultimate authority during an interim period that they say will eventually lead to a civilian-led government.  Reports from witnesses and live television feeds showed scenes of bloodshed in Khartoum, where dozens appeared wounded, and the site of the sit-in appeared to be on fire.  “The protesters holding a sit-in in front of the army general command are facing a massacre in a treacherous attempt to disperse the protest,” the main group organizing the protests said in a statement. “We call for sweeping civil disobedience to topple the treacherous and killer military council and finalize our revolution.”  The TMC, which is currently led by Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has spent the past weeks visiting the leaders of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who have made major financial contributions to shore up Sudan’s economy during the transition.  Burhan and his deputy, Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known by his nickname Hemedti, were instrumental during Bashir’s years in recruiting young Sudanese fighters to reinforce a Saudi and U.A.E.-driven military offensive in Yemen.  Hemedti commands a state security arm called the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, that is infamous for its role in an alleged genocide in Sudan’s Darfur region over a decade ago. The RSF were widely reported to be the ones carrying out Monday’s crackdown in Khartoum.  Western governments were quick to condemn the crackdown.  “Sudanese security forces' attacks against protesters and other civilians is wrong and must stop,” the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum wrote on Twitter. “Responsibility falls on the TMC. The TMC cannot responsibly lead the people of Sudan.”  “No excuse for any such attack,” wrote Irfan Siddiq, Britain’s ambassador. “This. Must. Stop. Now.”<|im_end|>

# Try to de-stress even as you prepare for severe weather

SARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - As dark clouds move in and the wind picks up, so can some people’s anxiety and stress over hurricane season.  After two years of hurricanes on or near the Suncoast, Jennifer Seabolt and her daughter Cierra find themselves preparing for another season. Jennifer is worried about the hurricanes. The two ladies live in a mobile home, which tends to be one of the first areas to be evacuated when the threat of a storm comes our way and where it floods deep.  Researchers at the University of California-Irvine released a study this year asking 1,600 Florida residents to report their hours spent watching media reports in advance of 2017’s Hurricane Irma and their anxiety levels in the aftermath.  “It is a daunting thought. Tremendous anxiety for some. But if a storm is coming you have to pay attention to reports,” said Terry Cassidy, the Executive Director of Behavior Health Sarasota Memorial Hospital. “There are ways to alleviate the stress of hurricane season. Staying alert but not stressing out is key.”  Cassidy leaves us with ways not to stress during Hurricane season:  Deep breathing can help with stress. Call a friend or seek someone to talk to about the stress. Exercise or try write down what you are stressed about. If you are thinking a lot about a hurricane, ask yourself how realistic this is to dwell on it?<|im_end|>

# Analysis | The Big Threat to Hong Kong’s Property Billionaires

Can Hong Kong’s billionaire heirs keep their grip on the city? Given Beijing’s increasing assertiveness in the territory, it’s a question worth asking.  For the past five decades, Hong Kong’s family dynasties have controlled the city’s riches, largely thanks to their hold on some of the world’s most expensive real estate. Hong Kong has more ultra-rich individuals than any other city in the world – and eight of its 10 richest men (yes, they’re all men) are directly involved in the property sector.  The last of Hong Kong’s “Big Four” property empires is now handing the reins to a younger generation, a cumulative transfer worth $109 billion, according to Bloomberg reporters Venus Feng and Blake Schmidt. Lee Shau Kee, the city’s second richest man, said last week that he’s passing the baton at Henderson Land Development Co. to his two sons, a year after Victor Li took over the empire of his father, and Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing. The Cheng family of New World Development Co. oversaw a succession in 2012. And at Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., where 66-year-old Raymond Kwok is chairman, a younger generation took over in 1990 after the death of founder Kwok Tak-seng.  These families have long benefited from close ties to the Hong Kong government and the city’s banks. But the younger set doesn’t necessarily have the same political capital with Beijing.  That’s why an extradition law in the works is currently making Hong Kong’s business community particularly nervous. If passed, the legislation could transfer fugitives in the city to China, courts are under control of the ruling Communist Party. Money hasn’t helped multimillionaires caught up in President Xi Jinping’s sweeping corruption crackdown. Last May, the former chairman of Anbang Insurance Group Co., billionaire Wu Xiaohui, was sentenced to 18 years in prison after a one-day trial, where he was convicted of fraud and embezzlement.  The head of Hong Kong’s pro-business Liberal Party has criticized the proposed law, saying it would hurt foreign investment in the city. The silence from the city’s developers, meanwhile, has been deafening.  A bigger threat to Hong Kong’s property tycoons is perhaps growing competition from mainland developers, who stand to benefit from Beijing stretching further into Hong Kong. These firms ramped up their presence in the city three years ago as Chinese officials ratcheted up efforts to cool the domestic property market. Conglomerate HNA Group Co.’s ability to beat local players in its bid for four plots of land at the former Kai Tak airport came as a shock. Mainland developers have logged $12 billion worth of land deals in Hong Kong in the last three years.  Over the past year, Chinese real estate firms, including HNA, have started to shrink their footprint in the city, as Beijing pressures debt-laden companies to lighten their load. But mainland developers still have massive balance sheets: Take China Vanke Co., which had total assets last year of $222 billion, compared with just $61 billion for New World Development. As soon as Beijing reopens funding taps, the city’s developers could find themselves on the back foot once again.  There’s a Chinese saying that “wealth never survives three generations.” Educated at some of the world’s most elite schools, many of Hong Kong’s property heirs may be savvy enough not to fritter it away. They’re still flush with cash and Hong Kong’s record real estate prices are making them richer by the day.  But their dominance will fade. At the end of 1997, Chinese firms comprised just 16% of the market value of Hong Kong’s stock exchange; now they account for around 68%. It’s just a matter of time before the city’s real estate goes the same way.

# One in four Ebola cases undetected in Congo - WHO - Firstpost

By Stephanie Nebehay  GENEVA (Reuters) - Roughly a quarter of Ebola infections in eastern Congo are estimated to be going undetected or found too late, a World Health Organization (WHO) expert said on Thursday.  But the WHO, in a weekly update issued subsequently, said there were "early signs" of an easing of the intensity with which the virus is spreading following weeks of insecurity that curbed access to communities and interrupted vaccination.  Some 2,025 cases and 1,357 deaths have been recorded since the epidemic began in August in the Democratic Republic of Congo's North Kivu and Ituri provinces, said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme.  It is the second-worst outbreak of the virus on record.  Some 88 infections have been detected each of the last two weeks, down from a peak of 126 weekly in April, and WHO teams are checking 15,000 suspected contacts each day for symptoms, he added.  "We believe, let me be very cautious here, we believe we are probably detecting in excess of 75% of cases - we may be missing up to a quarter of cases," Ryan told a news briefing in Geneva.  "We must get earlier detection of cases, have more exhaustive identification of contacts," he said.  About 90% of people potentially exposed to the virus have agreed to be vaccinated, which has proved efficient, he said. "It's not them that matter now, it's the 10% that don't, because all of our cases are coming from that group."  More than 130,000 people have been vaccinated to date, Congolese figures show.  The epidemic is "not out of control, but it is certainly not under control," he said.  It was spreading fast in the rural area of Mabalako and at a lesser rate in the city of Butembo.  A third of identified cases are people who died without having being admitted to Ebola treatment centres, the WHO update said.  Ryan said risks to aid workers had decreased of late but noted a deadly attack on civilians earlier this week.  A local official said 13 civilians were killed late on Monday in an attack by the Allied Democratic Forces - a group thought to be linked to Islamic State.  Greater political engagement is needed to combat the Ebola outbreak, Ryan said. "We need the government to reach out to the opposition, we need an 'all party' approach ... we need a single voice of leaders in Congo about this outbreak."

# Why this bus driver was caught for something else by speed camera

A Phone 'n' Ride driver was fined after being caught by a speed camera van - but not for the obvious offence.  Sue Mitchell, 54, from Habrough, received a £50 fine for not wearing a seat belt while driving down Weelsby Road, in Grimsby.  She claims she was wearing one but has ended up paying the bill of £50.  She said: “I always wear a seat belt. I have never driven without wearing one.”  Sue wanted to hire a solicitor after receiving what she describes as “rubbish” photographic evidence from Safer Roads Humber and Humberside Police, but found that solicitor fees would cost more than her £50 fine.  “My fine is £50 and it would cost me £150 in solicitor fees to fight it I didn’t want to pay a £50 fine for something I didn’t do, but it was my only option,” said Sue.  “On the letter, it said that the fine would increase to up to £1,000 after 28 days, if it remained unpaid."  Safer Roads Humber, in partnership with Humberside Police, use speed cameras to detect motorists who speed, do no wear seat belts, use their phones while driving, or drive without proper control of the vehicle.  A spokesperson from Safer Roads Humber said: “The cameras are able to detect a range of offences along with speed.  “These include not wearing a seat belt, number plate offences such as wrong fonts or spacing, using a hand held mobile phone whilst driving - this would include making a call, texting, holding the phone and using it in other modes.  “Another being when a driver is not in proper control of the vehicle. This could be someone not having a hand on the steering wheel, not looking at the road, picking something up from the floor, or drinking a cup of tea at the wheel.  “If it’s something that you wouldn’t do on a driving test, then it could be something you’re fined for.”  Follow or contact Grimsby Live  Contact us : Email the reporter who wrote this story .

# Paddy Galagher looking to get back to winning ways at Ulster Hall

Paddy Gallagher has shrugged off his controversial WBO European title defeat and is focused on bouncing back against undefeated Liam Wells at the Ulster Hall on June 21.  The former Commonwealth Games champion s) was narrowly outpointed by Freddy Kiwitt last time but has been handed a meaningful eight-rounder on a huge #MTKFightNight in his hometown of Belfast. As he prepares to grace the famous Ulster Hall on a bill that also includes Tyrone McKenna versus Darragh Foley for the WBC International super-lightweight title and Steven Ward against Liam Conroy for the WBO European light-heavyweight crown, Gallagher is fired up. “It was a melt after the Kiwitt fight and after that, I said I was retiring because I’ve fought at a high level and didn’t want to go back down a level. “I’ve had 20 professional fights now and I’m 30 years of age. I don’t know when I’ll jack it in because I’ve said three times in the last year I was definitely done and now here I am with another good fight, “I know Liam is a former world champion kickboxer. He’s young and hungry and he’s as game as it gets but he’s also there to be hit. “As well as a dangerous opponent, I’ve also got ESPN+ cameras on me and that’s class. “I’ve fought on lots of channels in Ireland, the UK and America so it’s great to be fighting on this platform. “I plan to win this fight and hopefully it can tee up some kind of title fight at Féile an Phobail. Then I want to push onwards again and see what happens in the next few months,” he added. Rising Essex star Wells was last seen outpointing the talented Jumanne Camero at York Hall – the second fighter with a winning record he has beaten in his fledgling career. Also on the undercard in Belfast are the likes Lewis Crocker, Taylor McGoldrick and highly-rated young middleweight Caoimhin Agyarko.<|im_end|>

# AT&T Exec Said Telco's Ideas Will 'Radically Reshape' TV | Light Reading

AT&T Exec Said Telco's Ideas Will 'Radically Reshape' TV The BauminatorJeff Baumgartner, Senior Editor, Light Reading6/6/2019Comment (0)Login50%50% Tweet The hyperbole was on high boil Wednesday as AT&T's John Donovan made some big pronouncements, but little detail, about how the company is evolving and transforming its TV business. At the Credit Suisse Communications Conference in New York yesterday, Donovan was asked about how AT&T's pay-TV and streaming video plans, including recent price changes for DirecTV Now and a coming "thin-client" version of the fuller-freight DirecTV service that will be delivered via the Internet rather than via satellite. "We're going to transform our product," Donovan said. "It's the consumer product I'm most excited about since the iPhone. It radically reshapes what your concept of television is." But how, exactly? After all, the market is teeming with relatively new OTT-TV options, with many of those services also grappling with razor-thin margins thanks to the continuous rise of programming costs. What TV magic does AT&T have in its bag of tricks? Here's where AT&T's vision for the future of video and pay-TV gets a bit hazy. The company, perhaps to keep its competition guessing or because it's still trying to figure out how it's going to truly offer something new and different, is not being very clear on this count. "We think we're going to be disruptive in the market on features and capability, but we need to evolve our product," he said. Donovan was later pressed if he'd care to elaborate on the innovations AT&T will bring to bear to pay-TV. "No," he responded, then jokingly chided his inquisitor for asking a question he already knew the answer to, along with a backhanded compliment. "You could be a reporter." Donovan was a bit more forthcoming on the timing of the new thin-client DirecTV product, noting that it's expected to debut sometime in Q3 2019. That offering is expected to center on an inexpensive AT&T-supplied Android TV-powered box alongside streaming support on various retail streaming platforms. Despite Donovan's dodginess about the features and capabilities that will grace that product, putting an OTT version of DirecTV's satellite TV packages makes a lot of economic sense. For starters, the cost of acquisition of an OTT-TV customer should be much lower than it is for DirecTV's satellite TV service. There's less (and cheaper) equipment involved, and the OTT version should allow for simple customer self-installs. And that product should help DirecTV/AT&T expand its addressable market. Donovan estimated that about 20% of US households can't get satellite TV due to line-of-sight issues and other restrictions. He said DirecTV, on occasion, will role a truck to a new customer only to find that the customer isn't eligible or capable of getting the service -- a big waste of time and money. "It's not immaterial," Donovan said of the portion of the market that the new product will allow AT&T to reach, noting that the company has a database of consumers who can't be served with satellite but would be eligible for the new thin-client TV product. That product "is going to be a great opportunity for us to have a product that's not only competitive but one that we would expect to take some share with," he said. AT&T could use something that steals some share, as its video business has been struggling alongside the broader pay-TV industry. The company lost 627,000 video subs in Q1 2019, including 544,000 legacy "premium" TV subs (DirecTV satellite and U-verse IPTV) and 82,000 DirecTV Now subs as OTT customers continued to roll off after early, heavily discounted rates dissipated. An SVoD assist? Donovan didn't advance the ball much regarding AT&T's plans to launch a subscription VoD service in beta form later this year and reach full commercial deployments in 2020. AT&T has alluded to plans to offer that product to traditional pay-TV distributors, so it seems likely that AT&T will attempt to package in this new SVoD product with its pay-TV offerings. But, following an earlier analyst's note that AT&T is now looking at a single-tier SVoD product (rather than one with three separately priced tiers with a different content mix), The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the new offering will cost $16 to $17 per month. Per the WSJ, the offering will include HBO, Cinemax and Warner Bros content, and cost just a bit more than HBO Now, HBO's standalone, direct-to-consumer OTT subscription service that fetches $14.99 per month. At the reported price, AT&T's new SVoD will carry a big premium over Disney+, a service set to debut in November for $6.99 per month. Bolstering the bundle AT&T is also hopeful that its new thin-client video option will refuel a service bundling strategy, making it much easier to combine TV with its broadband products. On that point, Donovan also provided an update on AT&T Fiber's progress, predicting that the unit will add 1 million subs this year, with roughly two thirds of them coming from cable. That prediction is in contrast to recent analysis that found that most of the new AT&T Fiber subs are coming from existing AT&T broadband subs (including U-verse customers) that have migrated or upgraded to faster, fiber-fed Internet service. While AT&T's DirecTV merger commitment was to have fiber deployed to 12 million locations by June 2019, Donovan reiterated that the number will be closer to 14 million. "We have a lot of inventory now," Donovan said, confident that AT&T Fiber is in position to achieve service penetration of 50% to 55% in as little as 24 months in some markets.

# Letter: Questions order of Memorial Day parade

There was a new occurrence at the May 27 Wooster Memorial Day Parade. The Disabled American Veterans were not first in line as usual. First was the mayor, then the firemen, then the policemen, then the fire trucks, then the band.  What is this parade for? Seriously! The people we respect, the mayor, police and firemen, should be ashamed as they marched in front of the veterans in the parade that remembers our fallen veterans.  Janet Karley,  Wooster<|im_end|>

# Fort William First Nation calls for Thunder Bay mayor's removal from police board | CBC News

Fort William First Nation calls for Thunder Bay mayor's removal from police board Relations between community, Thunder Bay 'will be severely impacted' if mayor remains on board Fort William First Nation (FWFN) is calling for Thunder Bay Mayor Bill Mauro to be removed from the city's police services board. In a letter addressed to board administrator Thomas Lockwood, FWFN CEO Ken Ogima states his community "can no longer sit idle and silent" with regard to the mayor's "consistent ignorance of systemic racism and discrimination." Ogima writes that his concerns don't extend to the board as a whole; he says overall, he's "extremely pleased" with the board's commitment to acknowledging and addressing systemic racism and discrimination within the Thunder Bay Police Service. Mauro's conduct, however, is a concern for Ogima, who cites a recent town hall meeting held by Mauro as an example. At the meeting, the mayor, Ogima writes, "those to share his personal beliefs" about two reports — one by Ontario Indpenendent Police Review Director Gerry McNeilly, and the other by Sen. Murray Sinclair, who was working on behalf of the Ontario Civilian Police Commission — both of which identified systemic racism within the police board, and police service. The board was temporarily stripped of its power, and Lockwood appointed as an administrator. The board members have since undergone cultural sensitivity and governance training, and had their voting rights restored. Mauro's beliefs, Ogima writes, "were heard through his use of words which denounced and [cast] a shadow of doubt ... on the two reports by suggesting that 'those guys' and the reports have painted an unfair picture" of Thunder Bay. Ogima states Mauro, as Thunder Bay mayor, "holds a significant role in moving this city forward." However, his statements about Thunder Bay's reputation "are seen by many" as an insult "to the hard work the current board is undertaking." Thunder Bay mayor says brother being named in police oversight report no reason to cite conflict of interest Thunder Bay mayor Bill Mauro blasts police reports during town hall Ogima goes on to state Mauro's comments about the reports is "a grotesque slight to the generations of people the reviews speak to including the families impacted by the tragic losses which triggered the need for the reviews." Ogima writes FWFN is currently partnering with the City of Thunder Bay on a number of initiatives, including the annual Indigenous Peoples' Day gathering, the Community Economic Development Initiative, and the Anti-Racism and Inclusion Coalition. He asks Lockwood and the Ontario Ministry of the Solicitor General to step in and remove Mauro from the board. If Mauro is allowed to remain, Ogima states, "it is my fear that the relationships between my community and Thunder Bay will be severely impacted." FWFN Chief Peter Collins has also issued a separate call for Mauro to be removed from the police board, and replaced with an Indigenous member. Celina Reitberger, board chair, has also expressed concern over Mauro's comments about the two reports. After the statement by Collins, Mauro told CBC News he's "just trying to get a bit of balance into the conversation." "Somehow it seems that when I try and provide a bit of balance, that people feel I'm being dismissive of the concerns that were raised in the reports and that's not the case," he said. Mauro said he has no plans to step down from the board.<|im_end|>

# Lady Gaga Just Discussed Her Breakup With Christian Carino & It Was Super Emotional

At her Las Vegas concert on Sunday night, Lady Gaga discussed her breakup with Christian Carino. Her reaction is a bit delayed—the couple split back in February during the middle of awards season. But the 2019 awards season was the definition of a whirlwind for Gaga. The actress/singer/songwriter took home two Oscars, a BAFTA, three Grammy’s and a Critics Choice award. She also performed at The Academy Awards and the Grammy’s. So, needless to say, her dance card was pretty full. But unfortunately, amidst all the A Star Is Born success and notoriety, she and her fiancé split up. Both parties were very quiet at the time, never went into any detail about why the relationship ended or how they were feeling about it.  But for the first time, Gaga made a public comment on her former relationship. The 33-year-old was performing in her Jazz and Piano show in Nevada, which includes many classic songs. When it came time for her to sing Ella Fitzgerald’s “Someone To Watch Over Me,” it triggered something in the crooner. The song is particularly emotional, all about someone searching for love. When introducing the number, Gaga acknowledged that this performance of the song would be different. Because last time she sang it? She was engaged to Carino.  According to Us Weekly, the songstress told the crowd, “Last time I sang this song, I had a ring on my finger, so it’ll be different this time.” Aw. That alone would stir up weird memories and emotions. And then, of course, the lyrics don’t help.  “Looking everywhere, haven’t found him yet, He’s the big affair I cannot forget, Only man I ever think of with regret… There’s a somebody I’m longin’ to see, I hope that he turns out to be, Someone who’ll watch over me.”  Here’s a clip of Gaga singing her rendition of the classic back in January when she was still engaged.  Well, here’s hoping Gaga can find a fan she won’t think of “with regret!” We believe in her. This comment has also come just after some weird social media activity on Carino’s part.  Last week, he posted a quote that read, “Miracles happen when she’s around me.” Umm…who is this “she?”  Two days later, he shared this gem of a photo that said, “Tell her you love her.” Which like, OFC. TYSM for pointing that out. But also…is this him saying he didn’t tell Gaga that he loved he enough? A source back in April did suggest that the pair broke up because Carino didn’t treat the “Shallow” singer well enough…eek! Lot’s of questions. Hopefully more answer’s to come…  Us RN:<|im_end|>

# Ascentage Pharma presents new clinical data of apoptosis-targeted drug candidates APG-115 and APG-1387 at 2019 ASCO

SUZHOU, China and CHICAGO, June 3, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Ascentage Pharma, a globally-focused, clinical-stage biotechnology company engaged in developing novel therapies for cancers, hepatitis B virus and age-related diseases, today announced that the company presented new data of two apoptosis-targeted drug candidates APG-115 (a novel MDM2-p53 inhibitor) and APG-1387 (a novel IAP inhibitor) at the 55th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).  With the theme "Caring for Every Patient, Learning from Every Patient", 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting attracted over 40,000 oncologists and researchers globally to present and share the cutting-edge research and achievements in clinical oncology in Chicago from May 31-June 4.  Ascentage Pharma presented the data from its most recent clinical trials of APG-115 in China and U.S. (Board #118 and #116), and the data of phase I study of APG-1387 as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in treatments of patients with advanced solid tumors (Board #117).  It is encouraging that in the study of APG-115 as a monotherapy, a confirmed PR was observed in 1 patient with liposarcoma (TP53-WT and MDM2Amp), with target lesion decreased 64%.  "Liposarcoma is a common histological type of malignant soft tissue sarcomas, accounting for about 15% of soft tissue sarcomas. There is no effective treatment for it and the probability of recurrence is high. Liposarcoma belongs to the 'cold tumor' type and has a poor response to immunotherapy," said Pro. Xing Zhang, Chief physician of Melanoma and Sarcoma Medical Oncology Unit of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. She continued, "We believe APG-115 is an efficient MDM2-p53 inhibitor. The data of Phase I study of APG-115 in Chinese patients with liposarcomas is encouraging. We enrolled 14 patients, 8 with liposarcoma; a confirmed PR was observed in one liposarcoma patient after 4 months of treatment discontinuance. Another 5 patients achieved SD (including 2 liposarcoma patients). Based on clinical trial results, APG-115 is well-tolerated and with acceptable safety profile. We expect further data to address the unmet medical needs."  There have also been promising advances in the Phase I study of a novel IAP inhibitor, APG-1387, as a monotherapy in treatments of patients with advanced solid tumors. Drew W. Rasco, M.D., Associate Director of Clinical Research at the START Center for Cancer Care in San Antonio commented: "Among 10 mPC (metastatic pancreatic cancer) patients treated with APG-1387 monotherapy, 3 patients achieved SD. One patient at MTD received SD for >9 cycles (3-wk a cycle) with the best response +6%, still ongoing; one patient achieved SD for > 8 months with best response of -16.7% tumor shrinkage. This preliminary result is worth mentioning, because mPC patients in general have only 3-6 months survival time, and overall survival rate of one year is 8.8%. Currently there is no effective treatment. We look forward to additional data from the on-going studies."  "APG-115 and APG-1387 are two apoptosis targeting products in clinical development of Ascentage Pharma. These results show our further progress in clinical development of targeting apoptosis. We are working hard to provide more therapy options for patients as soon as possible," said Dr. Dajun Yang, Chairman and CEO of Ascentage Pharma.  - A Phase I Study of a Novel MDM2-P53 Antagonist APG-115 in Chinese Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors  Through April 23, 2019, 14 patients with advanced solid tumors (8 LPSs) received APG-115 ranging from 100-200mg, QOD, 3 weeks on 1 week off, in a 4-week cycle. Two DLTs judged by investigator at 200mg (thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia). APG-115 was well-tolerated across all dose levels tested and the MTD was 150mg, due to the late onset thrombocytopenia, safety expansion was ongoing at 100mg. The most common Grade ≥3 AEs were hematologic toxicities, particularly thrombocytopenia, which were predictable as the activation of p53 in the bone marrow. APG-115 displayed approximately linear pharmacokinetics over 100-200mg range. A confirmed PR was observed in 1 patient with liposarcoma (TP53-WT and MDM2Amp) at the 150mg, and the duration of response has lasted after 4 months of treatment discontinuance. - A Phase I study of a Novel MDM2 Antagonist APG-115 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors  Through April 19, 2019, total 29 patients were treated with APG-115 at various doses range from 10-300mg. Most common TRAEs (>10%): fatigue, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, diarrhea, neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, white blood cell count decreased. Platelet count decreased, fatigue, and nausea were determined as DLTs. APG-115 at 100mg QOD (3 weeks on, 1 week off) was well-tolerated. The MTD/RP2D of APG-115 monotherapy was determined as 100mg. Base on the preliminary anti-tumor data, APG-115 is active. Nine patients achieved SD among 19 response evaluable patients. 50% (5/10) patients at MTD achieved SD among response evaluable patients. PK analyses have shown that AUC and Cmax generally increase dose proportionally over the dose range of 20-300mg. Serum MIC-1 (biomarker of TP53 activation) increase was exposure dependent within the dose range tested in patients with solid tumors. Further evaluation of APG-115 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors is ongoing. - A Phase I Study of a Novel IAP Inhibitor APG-1387 as a Monotherapy or in Combination with Pembrolizumab in Treatments of Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors  Through April 19, 2019, 24 patients had been treated with APG-1387 and 5 patients had been treated with APG-1387 plus pembrolizumab. APG-1387 was well tolerated and had manageable adverse events. Most common TRAEs (>10%) are fatigue. Two DLTs were observed at 60mg including lipase increase and facial nerve disorder, MTD of APG-1387 monotherapy was determined as 45mg. Three out of 10 mPC patients in APG-1387 monotherapy (at 45mg) achieved SD, one of them at 45 mg has been treated > 9 cycles with confirmed SD (+6%). Preliminary PK data of APG-1387 showed a dose proportionality in exposure (Cmax and AUC) over the dose range of 20-45 mg. APG-1387 treatment induced significant XIAP suppression in PBMCs and cytokine (especially IL-12p40 and IL-10) release in serum, suggesting a potential pharmacodynamics and host immunomodulation effects. The potential effects of APG-1387 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab deserve further exploration in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

# What is an IVA?

If you have any experience with debt problems, it is likely you have seen the term IVA crop up. An IVA (individual voluntary arrangement) is a formal and legally binding agreement between you and your creditors to repay your debt over a period of time. Once an IVA is in place, it stops creditors who are part of the arrangement from taking any further legal action against you.  Let’s take a look at how you can get an IVA and what it means if you do.  How do you get an IVA?  If you are unable to make the full repayments on the debt you owe, you may need to consider an IVA. An IVA will put in place an agreement with your creditors to repay your debt over a period of time (typically five years).  There are typically some qualifying criteria. You may need to prove that you have a regular and predictable income in order to set up an IVA. This is because an IVA requires you to make a set number of payments over a long period. It is also helpful if you have at least £100 a month in disposable income. Alternatively, you can sell something or remortgage your home in order to raise a lump sum to contribute towards the IVA.  First things first though, as an IVA needs to be set up by an insolvency practitioner and approved by a court. Your insolvency practitioner will work out what you can afford to repay and the period of time it will take you to repay your debt.  It is worth knowing that an IVA will start if the creditors holding 75% of your debt agree to it. Any creditors who disagree, but are in the minority, will then be required to adhere to the IVA.  Also, a CCJ (county court judgement) can be included in your IVA. This means that if you have a CCJ in place, once your IVA starts, all debt repayments will be made through the IVA.  How does an IVA work?  As mentioned above, your insolvency practitioner will work out how much you can afford to repay each month and over what period of time, and this will be agreed between you and your creditors.  As for the practicalities, you will make your monthly payments to your insolvency practitioner, who will then distribute the money among your creditors. Once you have completed your IVA and repaid your debt, you will receive a completion certificate. Three months later, the record of your IVA will be removed from the Individual Insolvency Register.  A word of warning: as with any financial commitment, there are repercussions if you miss payments. Your insolvency practitioner can cancel the IVA if you do not keep up your repayments, and therefore make you bankrupt.  Is an IVA the right move?  Whether or not an IVA suits your situation is down to your personal circumstances. The benefit of an IVA is that it gives you more control than bankruptcy (largely relating to if you own property or a car), but an IVA is not without risks.  Any savings or personal pension plans you have will usually be used to pay your creditors, and if you own property you may be required to remortgage it.  Having an IVA will impact your ability to apply for credit in the future, although some credit cards are designed for those with bad credit and may still consider your application.  Also, insolvency practitioners’ services don’t come for free. Insolvency practitioner fees average around £5,000, but this will be rolled into your monthly payments.  Verdict  If you have found yourself in a spiral of debt, an IVA gives you a structured repayment plan and freezes your existing debt. Although there are risks and an IVA can be costly, it allows you to have more control than if you were made bankrupt.  The upside is that once you have completed your IVA, it is removed from the Individual Insolvency Register. While you may have to declare an IVA when applying for some financial products, the end result is hopefully that you are debt free and looking ahead to the future.

# Lesbian and bi women share stories of harassment in support of couple attacked

A lesbian couple attacked on a night bus for refusing to kiss have triggered an outpouring of support on social media.  Melania Geymonat, 28, from Uruguay, was left with a suspected broken nose while girlfriend Chris, from the US, was also beaten up by the gang of men.  The attackers made obscene gestures and shouted at them to kiss before assaulting both women and stealing their belongings.  Other lesbian and bi women are now sharing their own stories of homophobic harassment in support of the couple.  One woman tweeted: ‘I was on a date with a woman in a bar on Exmouth Market and a man came over to us, tried to force us to kiss, [and] was aggressive.  ‘Nobody intervened. We had to leave. Everyone loves “pride” but is quiet faced with the reality of why we need pride and protection.’  She added: ‘We kissed in an alleyway. We literally hid and kissed. Do you know how funny and awful it is to be a grown woman hiding and kissing.’  Another woman wrote: ‘I’ve seen so many comments on how its shocking, what are we becoming, You just don’t live it.  ‘I have been attacked, [I have] been sexualised. My friend literally lost her eye and was left with a fractured face after a man on the tube attacked her for being a lesbian years ago.’  A third said: ‘Once I was outside a club holding hands with my girlfriend of the time. Fencer calls boss to say 'I'm a paedophile' after being caught by hunters ‘Two blokes ran up to us, grabbed the backs of our heads and literally did the “now kiss” thing. In some ways it was scarier than the time we “just” got beaten up walking home.’  Another woman remembered: ‘Had a group of men film me and my then girlfriend at a club because we were kissing.  ‘When I told them to f**k off one of them aggressively backed me into a wall and said “what you gonna do?”. Thought he was going to hurt me or my girlfriend so I backed down. It was terrifying.’  A fifth wrote said: ‘This has happened to me too many times. Once, two men, trying to chat us up, got aggressive and sexual when we said we were on a date and to leave us.  ‘Started making lewd remarks, trying to force us to kiss to “prove it” because we were clearly “lying to get rid of them”.’  Police have now launched an investigation into the attack, which took place around 2.30am on May 30.  The gang of men also stole a phone and a bag from Melania and Chris before escaping from the N31 bus. Boris Johnson wins his legal battle over 'Brexit bus lies' Both women have since attended hospital for treatment to facial injuries.  Melania, who moved to the UK in February and is on a year’s sabbatical from her medical studies, said she had felt safe in London and was stunned by the attack.  She said: ‘What upsets me the most is that violence has become a common thing, that sometimes it’s necessary to see a woman bleeding after having been punched to feel some kind of impact.  ‘I’m tired of being taken as a sexual object, of finding out that these situations are usual, of gay friends who were beaten up just because.  ‘We have to endure verbal harassment and chauvinist, misogynistic and homophobic violence.’  Laura Russell, Director of Campaigns, Policy and Research at Stonewall, said the attack was an ‘upsetting reminder of how much we still have to do for LGBT equality’.  She continued: ‘It’s tempting to think that in 2019, we are safe from attacks like these, and indeed we all should be. But sadly, this isn’t the reality. Pub 'bans' Germans during England's D-Day football match ‘On the first week of Pride month this year, a month for celebrating LGBT people and how far we’ve come, we’ve already heard harmful comments from politicians and seen continued debates around LGBT inclusive education and trans rights.  ‘We also know that this attack won’t be the only hate crime against the LGBT community this month.  ‘Government research found that more than two thirds of LGBT people said they had avoided holding hands with a same-sex partner for fear of a negative reaction from others. This attack is a reminder of why.’  Anyone with information about the attack is asked to contact police on 101 or tweet @MetCC and quote CAD737/30May, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.<|im_end|>

# Indian man gets 7-year jail for rape in UK

Indian man gets 7-year jail for rape in UK  Rana was sentenced after a jury found him guilty by a majority verdict of raping the woman in her 30s following a two-week trial in the Ipswich Crown Court. Updated: Jun 04, 2019 17:50 IST Ajay Rana, who raped a woman in Suffolk in December 2017, was sentenced to seven years in jail on Tuesday. Rana had fled to India and was detained in Spain in October 2018, he was extradited to the United Kingdom next month. Rana, 35, was sentenced after a jury found him guilty by a majority verdict of raping the woman in her 30s following a two-week trial in the Ipswich Crown Court. He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register indefinitely. The police said Rana offered the woman a lift at 5 am on December 9, 2017, saying it was cold and he had just given a lift to two other people. She accepted his offer as he appeared to be genuine, but in the next half hour he stopped the car and raped her. The woman managed to get out of the car and ran to a friend’s house nearby to get help, following which the police were called. The car was found to be registered to one of Rana’s housemates and he was a named driver on the insurance. Rana was reportedly enrolled as a student on a maritime course in the East Coast College, Suffolk. Rana’s friends told the police that he had left for London on December 12, saying that he had to go to India as his mother was ill. He was described as being in a worried state and that he contradicted himself and changed his story. The police located some of Rana’s earphones and matched DNA from them with swabs taken from the victim. CCTV analysis located his car driving the route through the town as described by the victim. Rana was identified as a suspect on December 13, but by then he was already flying from Heathrow. After taking a connecting flight, he arrived in India during the early hours of the following day. The Suffolk police then began proceedings to extradite Rana from India and also issued an European Arrest Warrant, which would allow for him to be detained if he attempted to enter another European Union member-state. Rana was then was detained under the European warrant by the Spanish Police in Bilbao on October 22, 2018. His extradition was approved by the Spanish courts and returned to the UK on November 12. Detective chief superintendent Eamonn Bridger: “The police investigation commenced following a calculated and sustained attack committed on an innocent victim, who has been left traumatised by the callous actions of this offender”. “This was a complicated investigation that was progressed with great haste despite the challenges presented by an offender who fled the country after the attack”.

# An Expert Reveals How To Approach Your Crush & Get A Date

How To Make The First Move, According To Experts, Because We All Know How Scary It Can Be Love Island may have its fair share of drama, secret romances, and heart ache but if it's good for one thing, it really gets me in the mood for romance. My dating app use must spike as I watch the islanders lie around and flirt with each other all day long. But, in reality, no matter how confident you are, approaching your crush is scary. However, it is 2019 and time for you to go out and get what you want. So here are some tips on how to make the first move, based on advice from experts, because it isn’t always as simple as a re-coupling. Working out how to make the first move with someone when marching up to them and saying hello sounds far too daunting, and can be enough to put you off going over to them all together. However, Dating Coach Hayley Quinn has an expert system to deal with the problem. “If you're attracted to someone you spot in real life who you have never spoken to before, apply the VEP," Quinn says. What VEP I hear you ask? Well, it's simple: Get VISIBLE: walk past them and make sure they see you. Smile and maintain EYE CONTACT to invite them to speak to you. Use PROXIMITY to get closer to them. Often, when given enough of a prompt, someone will also approach you. When it comes to asking someone out, confidence can get you a long way. But, if you have never asked someone on a date, it's natural you would be scared. But your potential date doesn’t need to know that, so try to keep a cool head. As Jean Smith, the dating expert behind Flirtology.com, says: "Studies have shown it takes only a few seconds to make a first impression. Upon first meeting us, people pick up clues about us both consciously and subconsciously. They only know what we tell them, so project yourself in the way you’d like to be perceived." As with most difficult things in life: practice makes perfect. Quinn says, “the more you do things like saying hello to someone you like, you send a clear message to yourself that you're an action taker, and you build a feedback loop where you really trust yourself.” The act of going over to a stranger to see if they would like to go for a drink might not be something you do everyday but if you do it in places that you feel comfortable, it can really ease the process. Quinn says, “if you go out to meet people in places you would go to spend time in anyway, there's a higher likelihood of you having something in common. So, if you love your local area, stick to local bars and coffee shops. If you're a fitness fan, head to a new class.” So, what about once you've locked a date down? It's an exciting time, but it also comes with a fresh set of worries: what if they don't like me? And what if I don't like them? What if, once they start talking, I actually find out they're different from what I thought? Well, Quinn has some great advice for this too: Stay open minded. The person you end up with is rarely the one who you had the best first date with. Give things time and don't jump to conclusions. Forget worrying about commitment. You don't even know if you like them yet. The first few dates are about having fun and seeing if you connect. With these tips, you should be all set to approach that special someone you've been crushing on. Just keep in mind that feeling confident in yourself and knowing your self worth is top priority. Give yourself time, dig out your nice top and jeans, and remember to have fun.<|im_end|>

# 2020 Democrats pushing to end public financing of fossil fuels

The climate plans released this week by Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden, Jay Inslee and Elizabeth Warren each include provisions to end U.S. government support for new fossil fuel investment overseas. Why it matters: Many new coal plants — up to 91% in Asia, for example — receive public development support from state-owned enterprises, foreign governments and export credit agencies, or multilateral development banks (MDBs). Reduced access to such financing could mean fewer new plants burning coal, the most carbon-intensive energy source.<|im_end|>

# Arctic education leader

A recent federal government investment of $4.5 million in the University of the Arctic (UArctic) will enable the network of more than 200 universities, colleges and research institutes to increase its activities and programming in Canada.  It will also allow for an increase in circumpolar engagement and co-operation.  Education and research  As members of UArctic, Memorial and Yukon College co-manage the funds, another example of Memorial’s leadership in national and international collaborations for education and research.  UArctic is among the world’s largest international networks of educational and research institutions. It leads, partners and supports co-operation for education, research and outreach concerned with education and research in and about the North.   “These challenges can only be tackled by having access to current, strong and quality information.” Memorial recently led the submission of a UArctic proposal to the federal government’s Arctic Policy Framework for re-engagement and support on a number of initiatives focusing on increased northern and Indigenous capacity-building for relevant circumpolar education and research co-operation.  “The changes taking place in the Arctic are not only opening up new opportunities, but are at the same time creating challenges, especially for the people who live there,” said Sheila Downer, strategic northern liaison with the Office of Public Engagement, and vice-president of finance, development and engagement with UArctic.  “These challenges can only be tackled by having access to current, strong and quality information. UArctic, through its member institutions, is rising to the challenges surrounding the need for research and can be impactful in assisting place-based solutions to issues affecting Arctic regions.”  An important aspect of federal re-engagement with UArctic is the strengthening of northern and Indigenous mobility by supporting international opportunities for students and faculty of Canada’s northern regions. It will also support internships for graduates and young professionals with northern business and industry, helping to build Arctic capacity competence and future northern leaders.  Funding for UArctic was part of a larger $28.7 million federal government commitment to the Arctic to support Canada at the Arctic Council, a sustainable development working group, permanent participation capacity and youth engagement.  “It is our hope to eventually see all the other Arctic countries be inspired by the long-term support agreements, as well as by Canada’s recent decision to re-establish support of UArctic’s leadership and programming for advancing international Arctic education and research co-operation,” Ms. Downer said.<|im_end|>

# Barry Jenkins to direct Alvin Ailey film

Barry Jenkins will direct a film based on the life of choreographer Alvin Ailey.  A spokesperson for Fox Searchlight on Monday confirmed that the studio is developing the project, with the ‘Moonlight’ filmmaker directing. Jenkins last helmed the Oscar-nominated James Baldwin adaptation ‘If Beale Street Could Talk’.  Raised in segregated rural Texas, Ailey became a pioneering choreographer, dancer and director who helped popularise modern dance. He died in 1989 at the age of 58 from Aids-related complications. In 2014, President Barack Obama awarded him a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom.  The film will be partly based on Jennifer Dunning’s biography ‘Alvin Ailey: A Life in Dance’. Searchlight last year began developing the film after securing the rights to Ailey’s choreography from the Ailey Organization.<|im_end|>

# Genetically altered, HIV-resistant twins might have shorter lifespan because of editing

The genetic mutation that a Chinese researcher claimed he used on a human embryo to create HIV-resistant twins may be linked to a shorter lifespan, according to new research. The findings from scientists at University of California Berkeley, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, will likely intensify criticism that the researcher carried out an experiment on humans long before the science was ready. In November, Shenzhen-based scientist He Jiankui said he had edited the CCR5 gene of the unborn twins to create a mutation that also can occur naturally. The naturally formed mutations, relatively common among northern Europeans, protect against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. But a new analysis of more than 400,000 genomes and health records in the UK Biobank found that people with copies of a similar mutation from both parents had a significantly higher death rate between ages 41 and 78 than those with one or no copies. The mutation, the Berkeley researchers found, is associated with a 21% increase in mortality later in life. “An important thing to consider is the fact that a mutation doesn’t just have one effect,” said Rasmus Nielsen, a UC Berkeley biologist and author of the paper. “So even though a mutation might fix one problem, it might create other problems.” Previous studies have shown that two mutated copies of the CCR5 gene are associated with an increase in death after a case of the flu. The research published Monday didn’t conclude why the mutation affected lifespan. Nielsen said there could be many possible explanations. The protein that the CCR5 gene codes for no longer works in people with two copies of the mutated gene, and that protein is involved in many functions in the human body. “There both seems to be some beneficial effects of the mutation and some negative effects,” said Nielsen. “The question really is whether the overall effect of that mutation tends to help you or does it lead to decreased mortality.” His work has also been criticized for using the gene-editing technology known as Crispr before its effects are well understood, and for conducting his work secretively. It has drawn condemnation from the international scientific community and the Chinese government. In the U.S. and Europe, genetic editing of human embryos is mostly prohibited. “I can’t imagine a scenario right now where Crispr editing in embryos is the best option for anything,” Nielsen said.<|im_end|>

# Spot the difference! Shahid Kapoor-Kiara Advani's 'Kabir Singh' kiss poster stays faithful to 'Arjun Reddy'

Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani are all set for their upcoming movie Kabir Singh's release on June 21. Their movie is an official adaptation of Vijay Deverakonda-Shalini Pandey starrer Arjun Reddy, which was a blockbuster hit when it released two years back. The makers of Kabir Singh have now unveiled a new poster from their film. Featuring Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani in a passionate kiss, this poster takes us back to the time when Vijay Deverakonda-Shalini Pandey also featured in such a passionate, hot kiss on the poster of Arjun Reddy. Interestingly Kabir Singh is being directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who also helmed Arjun Reddy. Arjun Reddy remains a special film for the director. For the uninitiated, Sandeep Vanga became a father while shooting for Arjun Reddy. He hence named his son after the movie. Talking about the switch from Arjun Reddy to Kabir Singh, Vanga recently told Mumbai Mirror, "The challenge this time was to create a Punjabi boy born and raised in Mumbai, who goes to Delhi to study medicine. It was important to get the colloquial accent and meter right. I like the way Arjun Reddy has metamorphosed into Kabir Singh."<|im_end|>

# Love Island viewers in shock over bombshell recoupling as Tommy steals girl

Love Island viewers were left on the edge of their seats tonight after Tommy Fury made a play for bombshell Lucie Donlan. The sexy surfer chose to couple up with the hunky Joe Garratt last night and the pair have really been hitting it off. As they chatted by the pool earlier in the day, Lucie revealed she would be “gutted” if Joe chose to couple up with another sexy single. And the feeling was mutual, as he reassured her that he only had eyes for her. But things took a sour turn when Tommy revealed he was also eager to get to know Lucie – and wouldn’t say no to coupling up with her either. Sure enough, he stuck to his word at tonight’s shock recoupling. Addressing the group, he explained: “So this decision is far harder than I thought it would be coming in here. “I've had 24 hours to get to know the girls and I feel anyone in my position would do the same and I’m trying to be polite about it. “I’m speaking from the heart and it’s all I can go with” Tommy Fury “She made me feel welcome, she’s absolutely gorgeous and every day I’m excited to know more and more about her.” As the atmosphere among the group became more tense, he continued: “It’s my gut and that's all I can go with. “I’m speaking from the heart and it’s all I can go with. “I’m choosing Lucie.” Viewers quickly rushed to Twitter to share their shock at Tommy’s cheeky antics. One user wrote: “Tommy doesn’t give a f***, go on lad, you get Lucie!” A second chimed: “Tommy Fury could probably couple up with every girl at the same time and nobody would say a thing.” While another joked: “Tommy is fire! Cancel the show, he’s just won Love Island.” And a final added: “All the guys just understood their level. Tommy is the head of the house now.” Love Island continues tomorrow tonight at 9pm on ITV2.<|im_end|>

# Police: NJ Man Facing Arson Charges After Pouring Gasoline Around Estranged Wife's Car, Home

JERSEY CITY, N.J. (CBSNewYork) — A New Jersey man is facing arson charges for allegedly threatening to burn his estranged wife Thursday.  Thirty-seven-year-old Wildemar Dangcil, of Jersey City, New Jersey, is facing multiple charges, including aggravated arson, terroristic threats, violation of restraining order and eluding.  Hackensack police say Dangcil’s estranged wife was sitting in her vehicle in her driveway when Dangcil poured gasoline around the vehicle.  The woman managed to get out of the vehicle and into her home safely, but Dangcil then poured more gasoline around parts of the house.  According to police, Dangcil never ignited the gasoline and he drove off in his vehicle a short time later.  His vehicle was found abandoned in a nearby town, and Dangcil eventually contacted police and turned himself in.  Dangcil was taken to the Bergen County Jail.  No one was injured.<|im_end|>

# Mum's shock as 10-year-old daughter's school 'begs parents to buy £3.80 books off Amazon for pupils'

A MUM has told of her shock after her daughter's school "begged" parents to buy £3.80 books from Amazon for pupils.  Stacy Cook, 36, said she was stunned to receive an email saying the school couldn't afford basic how-to-read titles for children.  Instead, White Meadows Primary Academy in Littlehampton, West Sussex, sent a link to an Amazon wish list "in the hope of some purchases being made" by parents and carers.  The school blamed budgets being "tighter than ever" for putting resources "financially out of reach" - but stressed contributions were not compulsory. Stacy slammed funding cuts that see West Sussex schools receive £30million less than the national average each year, according to the WorthLess? campaign for fairer funding.   It's sad that it's come to this Stacy Cook Stacy, mum of ten-year-old Isabelle, said: "It's sad that it's come to this.  "I received this email and I was shocked and saddened.  "It makes me so upset that something so important for our children's early learning is becoming so difficult for the school to afford. "What the school are finding is even the most basic equipment, such as books and even pens and pencils, are difficult to afford."  "Books should be one of the basic things all schools and all children have access to."  The school, which has more than 650 pupils, is situated in one of the "most underfunded counties" in the UK . 
 UNDERFUNDED  Of the 29 listed items on the Amazon wish list, many include the very first books school starters will come across.  Other individual books needed include atlases and healthy eating guides.  Now Stacy and other parents with children at the school are faced with the difficult decision of whether they can afford to purchase the books themselves.  Stacy said: "I'll be thinking about whether we can donate.  "The school is good school and their pupil premium is spent on things like learning mentors and an in-house counsellor for the children that need it. It's spent on the children's well-being.  "It would be amazing if the general public were to donate too."   Like many schools across the country, we are finding the current funding environment challenging School spokesperson A spokesperson from White Meadows Primary Academy said: “Like many schools across the country, we are finding the current funding environment challenging.  "We have worked hard to manage our resources the best we can, but we are now supplementing this by inviting parents to make voluntary contributions.  "As a school, we stress there is no obligation for parents to donate and we value the ongoing support from our families and the local community.”  It comes after PM hopeful Matt Hancock pledged to outspend Boris Johnson and Michael Gove on education as the Tory leadership turned into a bidding war on education.  most read in news In an interview with The Sun, the Health Secretary pledged a £3billion spending spree on state primary and secondary schools in England over the next five years.  It would see an extra £400 spent on every primary and secondary school pupil than the current £4,800 yearly average.  That is twice the extra spending Boris pledged to spend in his education policy launch yesterday - and his only covers secondary school kids.  We pay for your stories!

# Elvis Costello Accepts OBE From Queen, Dings Trump Without Saying His Name

Costello was awarded the O.B.E. in Queen Elizabeth II’s 2019 Birthday Honors List, which was publicly announced Friday. Academy Award-winning actor Olivia Colman and television adventurer Bear Grylls also received honors. The 64-year-old Costello explained in a missive posted on his website how he was “happy to accept” the “very surprising” title, given how some of his music has taken aim at the political establishment. “To be honest, I’m pretty tickled to receive this acknowledgment for my ‘Services To Music,’ as it confirms my long-held suspicion nobody really listens to the words in songs or the outcome might have been somewhat different,” he wrote. Costello’s 1989 song “Tramp The Dirt Down,” for instance, imagines him dancing on the grave of the then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Check it out here: Costello, who last year was forced to cancel a number of tour dates following surgery after a cancer diagnosis, revealed in his letter that he’d initially planned to refuse the accolade. He was convinced otherwise following a long chat with his mother and the fact that both his grandfathers fought in World War I. “So, it is in memory of those two British Army soldiers and because my Mam told me to do it, that I can proudly accept this award,” he added. Costello reserved his ding at Trump for the penultimate paragraph of the note:  It would be a lie to pretend that I was brought up to have a great sense of loyalty to the Crown, let alone notions of Empire. I used to think a change might come but when one considers the kind of mediocre entrepreneur who might be foisted upon us as a President, it’s enough to make the most hard-hearted “Republican” long for an ermine stole, a sceptre and an orb.<|im_end|>

# Peak season for enterovirus infections: CDC - Taipei Times

The nation has entered the peak season for enterovirus infection, with hospitals and clinics reporting a total of 11,007 visits for treatment last week, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday. The figure surpassed the peak period threshold of 10,500 visits in one week and is 9.3 percent higher than the previous week, the CDC said. The number of cases in Taoyuan, Chiayi City, and Yilan, Miaoli, Yunlin, Pingtung, Hualien and Taitung counties have passed their peak period thresholds, CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center Deputy Director Guo Hung-wei (郭宏偉) said. The main circulating virus in the past four weeks was enterovirus 71 (EV71), he said, adding that cases of infection with enteroviral subtypes that have higher risks of serious complications are also rising. Twelve cases of serious complications have been confirmed so far this year: six cases of EV71 infection, two cases of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infection, and one case each for coxsackievirus A9, coxsackievirus A10, coxsackievirus B5 and echovirus 11 infections, Guo said. Children under the age of five are at a higher risk of developing a severe EV71 infection, with the virus invading the central nervous system and causing damage to the brain, CDC physician Huang Wan-ting (黃婉婷) said. CDC Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥) advised adults and children to wash their hands thoroughly with soap to safeguard against the highly infectious disease. Children who are diagnosed with enterovirus infection should be temporarily separated from other children to avoid further transmission, Chuang added. Parents should be alert to signs of serious complications, including sleepiness, loss of consciousness, weakness or numbness in the limbs, continuous vomiting, shortness of breath and rapid heartbeat, and seek immediate medical attention at larger hospitals, Huang said.  The CDC also confirmed two domestic cases and two imported cases of measles that were reported last week. All four people are living in northern Taiwan, it said, adding that one of the two who contracted the disease abroad had visited Belgium and China, while the other one had visited Vietnam, China and Hong Kong. Two new cases of Japanese encephalitis were also confirmed in Chiayi City and Kaohsiung, it said. It is also the peak season of the disease, it said, advising people to guard against mosquito bites, especially when visiting pig farms, rice fields and other high-risk environments.<|im_end|>

# Lawmakers call for more resources as Oregon heads into another fire season analyses say will again be above average

SALEM — Saturday marked the official start of Oregon’s wildfire season, but without new resources the state is only incrementally more prepared to combat fire this summer than in past years. Over consecutive summers, fire ripped through iconic landscapes, endangered communities and choked towns with blankets of smoke. The state has already seen more than 1,000 acres burn this year. In a winter where priorities abound, wildfire preparedness has not come out a winner.  “In this biennium, we need a lifeline for our communities,” said state Rep. Pam Marsh, R-Ashland. Marsh’s district was ablaze through much of the summer, with fire coming dangerously close to structures. In addition to putting the community in danger, wildfires had massive economic impacts. The famous Shakespeare festival had to cancel events, costing it an estimated $2 million. Firefighters checked the wildfires, Marsh said, but the scorched town of Paradise, Calif., is a reminder that Ashland may not always be so lucky. Marsh said that’s why Gov. Kate Brown’s proposed budget “set off” her constituents. It included resources to staff a wildfire council, which Brown created through executive action this winter, but that council won’t have any impact until the fall at the earliest. Then, funding would still need to be acquired to carry out recommendations. Brown proposed no additional funding to bolster the state’s response to this summer’s fires. “It didn’t have any immediate relief for the community,” Marsh said. “What it had was a wildfire council. People were upset that there seemed to be long-term thinking but nothing to provide something for this season.” Despite a strong snowpack, a state analysis predicts another above average fire season. It’s what’s referred to as “the new normal.” That’s why Marsh is working to get a $6.8 million for wildfire mitigation and suppression before the 2019 legislative session ends. The package would give the Oregon Department of Forestry more resources to fight fire, help communities implement smoke shelters to shield vulnerable people when heavy smoke billows into town and provide more resources to the front lines to stop fires from growing. The plan is endorsed by representatives David Brock Smith, R-Port Orford, Jack Zina, R-Bend, Paul Evans, D-Monmouth, Kim Wallan, R-Medford, Tiffiny Mitchell, D-Astoria, Anna Williams, D-Hood River, Marty Wilde, D-Eugene, Gary Leif, R-Roseburg, Brad Witt, D-Clatskanie, Andrea Salinas, D-Lake Oswego, Cheri Helt, R-Bend and Sen. Jeff Golden, D-Ashland. It’s a stopgap measure, Marsh said, but a much needed one. Marsh supports Brown’s fire council, which she hopes will push the state to a more proactive approach that includes better land management, prescribed burns and more resources. “We are coming into this session having just experienced the two most expensive fire seasons in our state’s history,” Marsh said. Last summer’s season cost $514 million. Marsh is hoping to get the money in June through agency budgets rather than a bill. She has wide support, but she’s lacking an endorsement from Brown. Brown has signaled to lawmakers that she wants the council to come up with recommendations first, then get money. It’s what Evans, chair of the House Veterans and Emergency Preparedness Committee, called a “measure twice, cut once,” approach. Evans is also pushing a proposal. He introduced HB 3439, which seeks to simplify the state disaster response process. It would also make it easier to make an emergency declaration. Evans wants dedicated personnel assigned to vulnerable fire areas so they can strike as soon as the sparks do.  “We made decisions through land use, and quite frankly market economics, that allowed for people to build in areas where there are great views,” Evans said. “Unfortunately, places where there’s a great view are also places fire wants to go to most.” At Brown’s request, Evans isn’t pursuing his legislation, but intends to bring the concept up next session. “There were a lot of other issues that were on her table, and she wanted to give this appropriate time and study,” Evans said. “It was a proposal that was new to her.” When asked about where her priorities lie, Brown said the state is more prepared going into this season than last. She said the state is better aligned with the federal firefighting resources.. Oregon will have access to new infrared technology to see through thick smoke. But Brown said she wants to see more thinning and prescriptive burns on federal lands, steps. She can’t directly act on. “We are going to continue to advocate -- I am going to continue to work with my governors, Republican and Democrat in the West – to continue to push for more resources on the local level,” Brown said. Brown’s natural resources policy advisor, Jason Miner, said there are two National Guard battalions in Oregon trained for the season with a third coming. The Forestry Department is training 600 seasonal firefighters, and has 230 more on the way. Miner said the wildfire council would pursue long-term changes as well. Marsh and Evans say constituents are uneasy after watching the state burn year after year. “I don’t want to get in the way of what the governor is trying to do with her council,” Evans said. “That said, I’m very committed to reorganizing, in a rational way, our entire emergency management delivery system. What we have right now made sense 20 years ago. It doesn’t make sense for tomorrow, and it really warrants our attention.”<|im_end|>

# Ulysses Town Talk: Porchfest returns to Trumansburg on June 15

Rain or shine, no doubt about it, the best place to be next Saturday, June 15, is in Trumansburg. That’s when the village will host its annual Porchfest. The event, from noon to 5, is in its third year here, where festival goers stroll from porch to porch as entertainments rotate on the hour. Although the concept is simple — musicians playing on porches, enjoying themselves while spotlighting their talents — Porchfest has become somewhat of an international phenomenon. It all started in Ithaca in 2007, with less than two dozen participants. Now, the festival has taken on a life of its own and spread across the country. There is a Porchfest in major cities such as Philadelphia and Salt Lake City; smaller places like North Liberty, Iowa, and Grants Pass, Oregon; even tiny spots on the map including Folly Beach, South Carolina. There are any number of Porchfests now in the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario. More Ulysses Town Talk: Gemm Shop plans 50th anniversary celebration In T-burg, the festival has become successful beyond expectations. The community of only about 2,000 gives any other with an annual Porchfest a run for its money. If there is a center for the day's activity, it is certain to be the Trumansburg Conservatory of Fine Arts, at 5 McLallen St. The slate there will be just as diverse as any. George & Lynn will provide the blues from noon to 1. At 1, Bo Lipari & Friends perform with ukulele; at 2, the Celtic group Three Stone Fire entertains, followed at 3 p.m. by Bill Gregg & Friends playing folk guitar. At 4, Venissa Santi brings Latin and jazz vocals. Organizers said parking is available at the municipal lot on Elm Street, the T-burg Farmers’ Market or along Main Street as signs indicate. Vehicles are not permitted on village side streets. For a complete schedule with list of musicians and locations, see tburgporchfest.com. The great race What is a crit, you may ask? It is an abbreviation for criterium, a one-day bicycle race around a closed circuit. Each lap can potentially be as long as 10,000 meters, which translates to 10 kilometers, or about 6.2 miles. John Compton, of Main Street Bike Shop in Trumansburg, with the assistance of some local cycling enthusiasts, put together one last year in the village, which was so well respected by the sporting community that it caught statewide attention. “Last year was such a success, the New York State Bicycle Race Association (NYSBRA) asked our race to be the 2019 New York State Criterium Championships,” said Jessica Giles, who is a lead organizer of the event. “It’s a pretty big deal.” On Saturday, Aug. 10, the crit returns to T-burg with some 200 riders expected from New York and Pennsylvania; a crowd of spectators upwards of 300 is anticipated. Gearing up for the crit, Atlas Bowl, at 61 W. Main St., will host a community party from 3 to 5 p.m. this Sunday, June 9. “The intention is to offer another opportunity for our community to come together in healthy sport and camaraderie, at all age and skill levels, without having to wait until August,” Giles said. Come sign up as a crit volunteer. Bring your kids for the bike clinic, or have some family time bowling for free. The Atlas kitchen will open at 4. Although it is a fundraising event — there will be a silent auction, and cash donations are accepted — it is free to the public; no cover charge at the door, thanks to sponsors including Garrett’s Brewing Co., Good to Go Market, H&H Financial, Hart and Homes RE/MAX and the Trumansburg Area Chamber of Commerce . Century of progress It happened 100 years ago. On June 14, 1919, the Ithaca Journal reported that the newly organized Trumansburg Chamber of Commerce numbered about 60 members who were confident it would quickly increase to 100, the maximum number of charter members allowed. By Aug. 14, the organization had incorporated with the secretary of State of New York. L.J. Wheeler, president of the First National Bank; Charles W. Bowen, president of Trumansburg State Bank; and A. Irving Stover, a partner in Stover-Updike Hardware, were among the seven directors the first year. In the mid-1970’s, the word “area” was added to the name. Today, the chamber is led by Elaine Springer, president; Lindsay Hart, vice president; Kimberly Bell, secretary; and Kristina Dresser, as treasurer, on a board that also includes Suzie Gutenberger-Fitzpatrick, Greg Van Ness, Todd Parlato, Andrea Parker Megivern, Frank Dellaire, Ksana Broadwell and Steph Bailey. The Trumansburg Area Chamber of Commerce has earned kudos for reaching a centennial. Here’s to the next hundred years. Ulysses Town Talk appears every other Saturday/Sunday.

# Smith best batsman in the world: Finch

On the eve of their World Cup clash with India, Australia captain Aaron Finch on Saturday stoked fire by rating Steve Smith ahead of Virat Kohli as the best batsman in the world across all three formats. "When you have world-class players coming back into the side, it's unfortunate for the guys who miss out. But Steve (Smith) is the best batter in the world across all three forms of the game in my opinion," Finch said when asked what it meant to have David Warner and Smith back in the fold.  "We saw Steve had a really clear plan. He got under the bouncer until he tried to play one around in the 33rd over, I think, and hit it up in the air and nearly got caught. So then he just took that out of his game and again kept ducking under them. "So that was a really good lesson for all our batters that the best player in the world had shown courage to stick to his game plan for a long time and was successful. He probably swallowed his pride a little bit in terms of having to put a shot away that you'd look to score heavily off in a one-day game," he said. Asked about Smith's battle with Jasprit Bumrah on the morrow, Finch said: "I think all the guys are as well-prepared mentally and technically as they can be, and it's not about 'in tournament play like this', it's too quick to be tinkering with technique and things like that in my opinion. Well, it is for me anyway. "Some guys can do it really well and do it quickly. Smith seems to change his technique every couple of balls at times, depending on what he's facing. That's just not a huge strength of mine, to be able to do that." "At times in the past, we have probably let Kohli get off to a bit of a flyer with being just a bit too straight to him or a bit too full or just letting him off the hook early, and we know once he gets into his innings, he is so hard to stop. So you can't afford to play catch-up against great players. Same for Rohit," he said. The Australian captain further said that even Dhoni and Shikhar Dhawan have the ability to inflict damage. "You can't put too much focus just on two players because Shikhar Dhawan has had some good success against us. Also, we found it tough to get Dhoni out in Australia. When we'd get India into a bit of trouble, he would dig them out of the hole and bat right to the end and bat really deep. Even in the first two ODIs in India, he (Dhoni) was instrumental in getting them across the line," Finch said. "I think having David, who is so destructive at the top of the order, is great for the side and our batting line-up. We have always believed that we've got a side that can win the World Cup," said Finch. --IANS dm/arm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)<|im_end|>

# U.S. sanctions target Iran petrochemicals, analysts see modest effect

(Hatha al-Youm | Iraq News)-  The United States sanctioned Iran’s largest petrochemical holding group on Friday for indirectly supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a step it said aimed to dry up revenues to the Iranian military unit but that analysts called largely symbolic.Friday’s sanctions targeted the Arabian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company (PGPIC) for providing financial support to the economic arm of the IRGC, a military organization in charge of Iran’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs.The U.S. Treasury Department said Iran’s oil ministry last year awarded Khatam al-Anbiya, the IRGC’s economic and engineering arm, 10 projects in the oil and petrochemical industries worth $22 billion, four times the official budget of the IRGC.The new sanctions come as the Trump administration seeks to increase economic and military pressure against Iran both because of its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for proxy groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.U.S. President Donald Trump antagonized Iran, and dismayed key U.S. allies, when he last year pulled out of a 2015 agreement between Iran and world powers under which Tehran curbed its nuclear program in return for easing some sanctions.U.S.-Iranian tensions have heightened further since April because of Washington’s moves to cut off Iran’s oil exports, its deployment of an aircraft carrier strike group to deter any Iranian attacks on U.S. interests, and recent attacks on Saudi, Norwegian and Emirati tankers that Washington blamed on Tehran.Iran has denied responsibility for the May 12 attacks on four tankers off the United Arab Emirates coast.The Treasury said it had also sanctioned the PGPIC holding group’s network of 39 subsidiary petrochemical companies and foreign-based sales agents. PGPIC and its units have 40% of Iran’s petrochemical production capacity and account for 50% of Iran’s petrochemical exports, it said.“This action is a warning that we will continue to target holding groups and companies in the petrochemical sector and elsewhere that provide financial lifelines to the IRGC,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.Senior Trump administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the sanctions as the latest examples of a broad economic clampdown on Iran’s economy that would help dry up funds for the IRGC, a key part of its military.“This would continue to have a very chilling effect on the prospects for any future recovery for the Iranian economy,” one official told Reuters, saying the petroleum and petrochemical industries “have been serving for the last 40 years as a kind of institutionalized slush fund for the IRGC.”U.S. persons are already barred from nearly all dealings with the Iranian economy, so the latest sanctions largely apply only to non-U.S. companies and individuals.Three analysts and a former Treasury official said the latest sanctions will likely have only a modest effect because non-U.S. companies already shy away from doing business with Iran’s petrochemicals sector because of existing sanctions.Under sanctions reimposed on Nov. 5 after Trump left the Iran nuclear deal, anyone carrying out a significant transaction in Iranian petrochemical products could already be hit by a menu of sanctions, including being barred from the United States.Friday’s step makes PGPIC and the 39 affiliates “specially designated nationals,” a status that effectively blocks U.S. persons from dealing with them. Further, anyone who does so themselves risks becoming a “specially designated national.”Suzanne Maloney of the Brookings Institution think tank described the latest U.S. sanctions as “a natural next step in what I think is a deliberately redundant array of restrictions.”“The administration is banking on the overlapping authorities and obstacles to compound the pressure on the Iranians and create a sense that the entire economy is off limits,” she added.The former Treasury official, who asked not to be named, said the new sanctions would have little effect because most multinationals had already ceased dealing with Iran, and described them as “a public relations” move.“It’s a good way of keeping the political pressure on the front page,” the former official said.

# YouthBuild helps with flood relief efforts in downtown Alton

photo submitted by photographer Andrew Dobson  Students from Lewis and Clark Community College’s YouthBuild AmeriCorps program volunteered May 31 to fill sandbags in downtown Alton to hold back historic flooding.  A group of students from Lewis and Clark Community College’s YouthBuild AmeriCorps program volunteered May 31 in downtown Alton to help with flood relief efforts.  Fourteen student volunteers filled more than 800 sandbags from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. to help hold back historic flooding, as water levels continued to rise.  “We are extremely proud of their efforts to jump in and help when emergency situations, like the flooding we are experiencing now, arise,” Director of Building Futures/YouthBuild Sabrina Davis said. “Building Futures YouthBuild/AmeriCorps members have performed more than 45,000 hours of service in the community since 2016. Our students pledge out loud every morning to make our communities safer, stronger and healthier for everyone. They are AmeriCorps members, and they are called to serve.”  Construction Trainer Mitch Fletcher and full-time AmeriCorps member Spencer Hughes led the efforts, organized by policy council members and students Parker Grassle, 19, and Zachary Cable, 18.  Davis said Lewis and Clark’s program participants perform 450 hours of community service each year, in addition to attending a service-learning course every Thursday. Together, they decide on a service-learning project each month.  Cable said they chose to help with flood relief efforts to give back to the community that’s helping them find their career paths. YouthBuild is housed at L&C’s Scott Bibb Center on Central Avenue in Alton.  “It was fun getting out there and working with the community,” Cable said. “It was a very good feeling to know what we were doing actually made an impact.”  Grassle echoed his sentiment.  “It was good to see the community get together for one goal — to fight the flood,” Grassle said.  It was also an opportunity to spread the word about what YouthBuild is and how it can help set others down the path to a rewarding career.  “We got to talk to several people from the community, and even let another person our age know about YouthBuild — and now, he’s planning to join,” Cable said.  Both students started in YouthBuild last January. Cable plans to take courses in L&C’s Drafting and Design program in the fall, and Grassle intends to follow a career path in construction through YouthBuild.  Sunday morning, the rising waters surpassed high water marks from 1844 (36.90 feet) and 1973 (36.89 feet). According to the National Weather Service, flood stage at Alton’s Melvin Price Locks and Dam is 21 feet. As of 1 p.m., Tuesday, June 4, the water stood at 38.06 feet in Alton, a level second only to the Great Flood of 1993, when the water level reached a record 42.72 feet on Aug. 1, 1993.  The water isn’t expected to crest until Wednesday or Thursday of this week, at a projected 39.2 feet.  YouthBuild AmeriCorps is a program designed to serve out of school youths, ages 16-24. The program is designed to prepare young adults to take the GED/high school equivalency (HSE) exam or complete their high school diploma while gaining skills in construction, information technology or CNA.  YouthBuild functions as an AmeriCorps network affiliate member. The AmeriCorps component of YouthBuild provides students with leadership opportunities while earning them money for education and developing an appreciation for citizenship through service learning activities within the community.<|im_end|>

# Vampire: The Masquerade – Coteries Of New York swoops into view

Did you hear? Singleplayer games are undead, and the latest nail in the coffin is yet another Vampire: The Masquerade game. The third announced in as many months, Vampire: The Masquerade – Coteries Of New York is coming to us from small studio Draw Distance, previously iFun4All, developers of Serial Cleaner and the recent Ritual: Crown Of Horns. Beyond a small teaser trailer, and plans of a fourth-quarter launch, we don’t know much about the game other than it being a solo “narrative experience” based on 5th edition Vampire. Below, the teaser; rich with logos, light on game.  Not to be confused with Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 (by Hardsuit Labs & Paradox) or the still-unsubtitled Vampire: The Masquerade from Big Bad Wolf, Coteries Of New York shares the license, but sounds like it’s doing its own thing. Draw Distance describe it as an “interactive story meets choices-that-matter; dark, atmospheric, emotional narration meets Telltale-like way of creating morally challenging dilemmas”. A choose-your-own-adventure with stat checks? It’s almost impressive how much they have let on without showing or telling us how it’ll work.  In Vampire parlance, a Coterie is a your standard adventuring party, but for modern-day vampires. The game will tell the story of the Camarilla (the ‘lawful’ vampire clans banner) feuding with the Anarchs (exactly what it sounds like – independent, free-willed clans), and the player will pick from one of three Camarilla characters to play as. A choice that’ll alter your dialogue options, both in terms of personality and what supernatural powers you have. Draw Distance are keen to emphasise that the game is built to be replayed, and they’ll be expanding it with new standalone stories post-release.  It looks like World Of Darkness fans are going to be well served for the next year or two. You can see a little more info on Vampire: The Masquerade – Coteries of New York’s Steam page here.<|im_end|>

# Thug held ex-girlfriend prisoner and used her as human punch bag

A man subjected an ex-partner to a "prolonged and brutally savage beating" in her own home, a court has heard.  Morgan Charles has a history of violence towards women, including breaking another partner's jaw in a screwdriver assault.  Sending him to prison, a judge branded the 34-year-old a "woman beater" and a "complete coward".  Swansea Crown Court heard Ralph turned up drunk at his ex-partner's house on the evening of May 11, and was allowed in.  Sian Cutter, prosecuting, said he stayed the night at the property then the following morning continued to consume alcohol before launching the unprovoked attack.  The court heard he effectively kept the woman prisoner in the house for the next three hours, and subjected her to repeated punches to the face and body - the victim estimated around 50 blows - as well as pushing her down the stairs, kicking her, biting her, and head-butting her.  Miss Cutter said that on a number of occasions Ralph put his hands around her neck and squeezed, telling the terrified woman he was going to "put her to sleep".  The court heard the woman managed to make a 999 call to police - but Ralph could be heard in the background continuing to hit her while she was on the line.  As officers were arriving at the property the woman managed to climb out of a window to safety.  She was left with a badly swollen face and blood "dripping from her mouth".  In his initial police interview Ralph claimed he was the victim, and said his ex had attacked him and he had only acted in self-defence.  The court heard he has 54 previous convictions for 102 offences, including 12 for violence - "the vast majority" of which are assaults on women.  He had previous convictions for violence against partners and former-partners, including breaking the jaw of one woman in an attack with a screwdriver.  John Tarrant, for Ralph, said his client accepted he had "significant issues" around domestic violence which he needed to deal with.  Judge Paul Thomas QC described the incident as a "prolonged and brutally savage beating" which continued even as his victim was calling for help, and said Ralph had treated his ex- as a "human punch bag".  He said: "To use the colloquial, you are a woman beater. Or, to put it another way, a complete coward."  Giving the defendant a one-third discount for his guilty plea he sentenced him to two years and three months. Ralph will serve half that period in custody before being released on licence to serve the remainder in the communtiy.  He was also made the subject of a three year restraining order banning him from contacting his ex.  The judge said it was mystery to him why Ralph had not also been charged with false imprisonment, and said if he had been he would now be facing a significantly longer sentence - he said he wanted an explanation from the police and Crown Prosecution Service as to why that charge had not been preferred.<|im_end|>

# Letter: Worcester County leaders must adopt the civic attitude

Mike Kennealy, Massachusetts' secretary of Housing and Urban Development, recognizes (As I See It, May 29) the importance of “Engaging Central Mass. in the Commonwealth’s economic development strategy.” Keneally emphasizes the Massachusetts MasterWorks program, which finances locally determined investments. Unfortunately, the program fails to implement a holistic vision of The Good Society. So the question remains: What needs to be done? In the Age of Information, Francis Bacon’s dictum has become the keystone of communal prosperity: knowledge really is power. Central Massachusetts planners should regard Worcester as a core regional city, which competes in the global marketplace of ideas by exploiting its several collegiate resources. Forward-looking planners must give top priority to construction of a first-class Boston-Worcester Railroad Line in order to make Worcester an extension of the Boston-Cambridge Intellectual Complex. They should complement their inter-regional transportation policy with a regional policy that upgrades local Intellectual Infrastructure. Worcester, for example, needs a first-class public school system, public library, art museum, and theatre; it also needs an upscale cinema like the West Newton Cinema. The flourishing global community entails a citizenry that is committed to lifelong learning. In order to facilitate restoration of The Good Society, Worcester County leaders must adopt the civic attitude of the Scottish-American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie: the public library is an extension of public education by other means. It would be nice if local public library leaders in Worcester County were out front leading the Promethean Parade to make Americans well-informed again. David P. Nelson Hubbardston<|im_end|>

# From Gaza to Iraq: Fire is a new weapon of ISIS, Hamas and others

Arab Israeli Conflict Middle East News Israel News Hi Tech News TRENDING STORIES Diaspora Premium WORLD NEWS A fire burns in scrubland on the Israeli side of the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip, near kibbutz Gevaram.

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World. As one of our loyal readers, we ask you to be our partner. For $5 a month you will receive access to the following: Help us grow and continue telling Israel’s story to the world. Thank you, Ronit Hasin-Hochman, CEO, Jerusalem Post Group Yaakov Katz, Editor-in-Chief In 2018 Hamas hit upon a new way to terrorize Israel. Its activists and supporters began attaching incendiary devices to balloons and floating them over the border from Gaza. In Iraq Islamic State has also been burning fields across the center and north of the country to terrorize Iraqi farmers and to target various areas, including Sinjar where members of the Yazidi minority live. More than 2,000 fires have been set in southern Israel and 8,700 acres burned between May 2018 and May 2019, according to the Meir Amit Intelligence and Information Center. The use of balloons to transport burning material over the border has increased according to the Meir Amit report. It is obviously an innovative strategy that Hamas set upon when it realized that its Great Return March mass protests and other activities, such as tunneling, had been thwarted.The relationship between ISIS using burning fields to terrorize people and Hamas using balloons is not clear, but in the past extremist groups have barrowed tactics from Hamas to use across the region and the world. For instance suicide bombings, vehicular attacks, mass stabbings and other attacks became common methods to attack Israel before they became as common abroad.Thousands of acres have been burned in Iraq and Syria in the last months as ISIS began using fire as a weapon. In May ISIS members infiltrated villages near Makhmur, an area that is exposed because it is along the line where Kurdish Peshmerga forces of the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government patrol and where there is a gap between them and the Iraqi army forces. ISIS exploited this gap between Iraqi and Kurdish forces to begin threatening farmers. ISIS demanded taxes or it would burn their fields.

# Las Vegas Sands Sells Pennsylvania Casino to Double Down in Asia

Sands Bethlehem was always an odd resort in Las Vegas Sands' (NYSE: LVS) portfolio. The property isn't in a major city center and isn't in one of the biggest gaming markets in the world, which is where the company normally operates. So, when the opportunity to sell the Pennsylvania property for $1.3 billion came up, it's no surprise management jumped on it. The sale to the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama is now complete, and Las Vegas Sands is even more flush with cash than it was before. Here's where the money might be going. Continue Reading Below The rich get richer You can see in the chart below that Las Vegas Sands doesn't really have a debt problem. Its debt-to-EBITDA ratio is well below 2.0, which is very healthy for a gaming company, and it has capacity to add debt if it expands into new markets. But short term, it would make sense for the funds from Sands Bethlehem's sale to stay on the balance sheet before being paid out to investors as a dividend. Where Las Vegas Sands is investing next Indirectly, some of the cash will be used to expand in Macau and Singapore. Sands Cotai Central in Macau is getting a $1.1 billion face-lift that will add a London-themed resort. In Singapore, a $3.3 billion expansion of Marina Bay Sands is already underway. The new hotel tower will be an attraction for guests, but the big win was keeping exclusivity in the gaming market with other operators clamoring to enter. Advertisement Outside of these two projects, which could easily be funded with cash generated in each market, Las Vegas Sands doesn't really need an extra $1.3 billion for investing in gaming projects. The dream Long term, the hope is that Las Vegas Sands will win one of the gaming licenses in Japan, which could lead to the costliest resort ever built -- as much as $12 billion. Early proposals have been presented to cities in Japan, but no concessions have been granted, and no one knows quite when construction will get underway. Japan is a bit of a conundrum for gaming operators because they have to keep enough powder dry to be able to afford to build there. But keeping cash on the balance sheet isn't a great use of capital in a low-interest-rate environment, so companies like Las Vegas Sands would rather increase dividends or buy back stock if they aren't going to win a bid in Japan. But ultimately, if Japan can be as profitable an investment as Singapore was for Las Vegas Sands, it'll be worth any financial sacrifice. Narrowing the focus Selling Sands Bethlehem isn't just about the cash being generated, it's about focusing Las Vegas Sands' business on the markets where it has differentiation. It's investing in Singapore and Macau and wasn't likely to expand in Pennsylvania anytime soon. That makes it a good time to get out of the regional gaming market, especially when the price tag hits $1.3 billion. 10 stocks we like better than Las Vegas SandsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Las Vegas Sands wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. *Stock Advisor returns as of March 1, 2019<|im_end|>

# A Weakening Economy May Be the Biggest Threat to Donald Trump

On Friday morning, the Labor Department released its jobs report for May, which showed a sharp slowdown in hiring. Donald Trump was still in Ireland, preparing to fly back to Washington. He didn’t immediately react to the news that employers created only seventy-five thousand jobs last month, which wasn’t surprising. Trump hates acknowledging negative developments that occur on his watch, and he is surely aware that a slump in the economy could prove disastrous for his reëlection campaign. Despite all the troubles and strife of his first two and a half years in office, he has been able to point to strong economic growth and a very low unemployment rate as reasons why Americans who aren’t enamored of him personally should support him. If that rationale is removed, what does Trump have left? A weakening economy could well be the biggest political threat he faces. One month of weak jobs data doesn’t translate into a slump, of course. Despite Friday’s report, which also showed a modest fall in wage growth, most economists think that the economy is still in decent shape. When the National Association for Business Economics surveyed more than fifty economic forecasters recently, the average prediction was that the economy would grow by 2.6 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent in 2020. Such an outcome would represent a slowdown from the 2.9 per cent growth recorded in 2018, but a relatively modest slowdown that is unlikely to present very much of a political threat to Trump. (He’d still have to explain why G.D.P. growth hadn’t reached his target of four per cent, of course.) However, even before Friday’s employment report, there were worrying signs of softness in other important economic indicators, particularly capital spending by businesses, and also evidence to suggest that this weakness was tied to Trump’s trade wars. As I noted in a column earlier this week about the resignation of Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, business surveys show that Trump’s tariff threats, particularly those directed at China, are creating a lot of uncertainty, which is reflected in businesses taking a cautious approach to spending and hiring. The Federal Reserve, too, is watching anxiously. “We do not know how or when these issues will be resolved,” its chairman, Jerome Powell, noted in a speech on Tuesday. Powell added that the Fed was “closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion”—a statement which Wall Street took to mean that a cut in interest rates is now a live possibility. To some people, particularly political foes of Trump, Powell’s statement made it look as if the Fed might be preparing to bail out an irresponsible President. But Powell appears to have been responding primarily to developments in the bond market, where yields on long-term government securities have fallen precipitously in recent weeks—an indication that investors think the economy is considerably weaker than it looks. Although the Fed relies on a wide range of data in setting interest rates, the signal from the market is “something I definitely take into account,” John Williams, the president of the New York Fed and a close ally of Powell, said at the Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday. In any case, Powell’s verbal intervention didn’t win him plaudits from Trump, who for months has been tearing into him and his colleagues for raising interest rates too aggressively last year. During an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, in Normandy, France, on Thursday, Trump again targeted Powell, saying, “Who thought he was going to raise interest rates? If we didn’t have that, we’d be at 5.2”—per cent G.D.P. growth—“and the stock market would be up ten thousand points more.” Trump plucked those figures out of nowhere, of course, and they are completely unrealistic. The U.S. economy hasn’t grown at an annual rate of five per cent for thirty-five years, and even if the Fed had stood pat in the second half of last year, when it raised rates twice, the rate of growth now wouldn’t be anywhere near that figure. It’s equally ridiculous to suggest that, but for Powell and his colleagues, the Dow could be standing at thirty-five thousand. In fact, the main thing that investors have been fretting about isn’t higher interest rates: it’s the trade war that Trump himself has created. Much as the President would like to shift the blame, the timing of recent movements in the stock market is unambiguous. At the end of April, the S. & P. 500 stock index hit an all-time high. In May, Trump threatened to impose broader tariffs on China and Mexico, and the Dow fell more than six per cent on the month. It was only after Powell signalled that the Fed may step in to support the economy that stocks rebounded. Trump won’t let reality interfere with his messaging, of course. Having already singled out Powell as his whipping boy for anything that goes wrong in the economy, he is sure to escalate his attacks on the Fed if signs of weakness in the labor market and elsewhere persist. That leaves Powell in a public-relations bind. If the Fed doesn’t move rapidly to cut rates, Trump will assail him. If the Fed does act quickly to try to prolong the economic expansion, it will be accused of caving in to a bully in the Oval Office. For now, the central bank seems likely to keep rates on hold, to give it time for further assessment. The next meeting of the Fed’s policymaking committee will be held on June 18th and 19th. That’s about a week before Trump is due to meet Xi Jinping, the Chinese President, at a G-20 summit in Japan. The Fed, with its eye on trade tensions, seems unlikely to make any big changes before it sees whether that sitdown prompts Trump to abandon (or postpone, at least) his threat to expand greatly his existing tariffs on Chinese goods. Earlier this week, he said he’d reach a decision after the meeting. With the 2020 election seventeen months away, Trump now has a key decision to make: How far is he willing to push his trade wars even as the economy and financial markets are starting to emit some distress signals? This weekend, he stepped back from the brink in his confrontation with Mexico. Tweeting from Air Force One on Friday afternoon, Trump said there was “a good chance” that the two sides would reach a deal to avert the imposition of tariffs, but he added, “If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% level on Monday!” On Friday night, Trump announced that an agreement had been signed, saying, “Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.” In return, he said, Mexico had agreed to “take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border.” The entire Mexico scare was a classic Trump ploy: creating a crisis and then claiming the credit for resolving it. American companies that import a lot of components and finished goods from Mexico will be relieved that the tariff threat has been lifted; so will Mexican exporters. The larger question of where the U.S. economy is heading in 2020 remains unresolved.<|im_end|>

# Six injured in car crash after police pursuit

Three people have been taken to hospital following a crash involving two cars at a Grimsby junction.  It is understood police were in pursuit of a silver ford Focus when it collided at the junction of Dudley Street and Cromwell Road shortly after 2am today.  In total it is believed there were five people travelling in a silver Ford Focus which collided with a black Suzuki carrying two people.  Firefighters said six people suffered injures. Two of the casualties have serious injuries and have been taken to Hull Royal Infirmary.  A third patient was taken to Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital, in Grimsby.  Two of the most seriously injured are understood to be women, one from the silver ford Focus and one from a black Suzuki.  Police spent hours searching for at least one man who fled the scene, through a garden of a property on Littlefield Lane.  Humberside Police Crime Scene Investigators are examining DNA from airbags of the silver car.  It had been driven along Earl Street and into Littlefield Lane before colliding with the Suzuki at the Cromwell Road junction.  Police were first on the scene, swiftly followed by Humberside Fire and Rescue Service crews who used cutting equipment to free a woman trapped in the Suzuki.  Ambulance crews arrived shortly afterwards and found the casualties being treated by residents from Littlefield Lane awoken by the crash.  A woman was trapped in the black Suzuki for nearly two hours, according to a resident.  she said: "The woman's condition had to be stabilised before attempting to free her. There was a lot of spilled fuel on the road so it was very difficult for the rescuers to get her out without igniting the fuel."  A spokesman for East Midlands Ambulance Service said: "We received a call at 2.15am to Cromwell Road in Grimsby. The caller reported there had been a road traffic collision. We sent three crewed ambulances.  "Two patients were taken to Hull Royal Infirmary and one patient was taken to Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital."  A spokesman for Humberside Fire and Rescue Service said there were six casualties in total, four of whom got out before arrival of rescuers.  He said there were two adult female passengers trapped in vehicle.  "One adult female was released by the fire service using hydraulic cutting gear to remove rear door. Second adult female released by Fire Service using hydraulic ram and cutting gear to reform the vehicle.  "Fire Service personnel assisted paramedics in moving casualties from vehicle to awaiting ambulance using long boards," he said.

# Jimmie Rivera Opens Up On Recent Losses • MMA News

UFC bantamweight Jimmie Rivera will be making his Octagon return this Saturday at UFC 238 against Petr Yan inside the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, and he will do so with an opportunity to erase his recent setbacks. After winning a remarkable 20 consecutive fights, Rivera has now lost two of his last three contests at the hands of Marlon Moraes and Aljamain Sterling. In a recent interview on the Pull No Punches podcast, Rivera opened up on both losses, beginning with his first-round knockout loss to Moraes at UFC Fight Night 131 (Transcript via Bloody Elbow):  “For everybody watching that fight, it seemed like two-seconds,” Rivera said. “For me it was 10-15 seconds. I was like ‘body shot, body shot, blocking, blocking. F—k, it’s going to my head and my arm isn’t going hard enough. F—k!’ and he caught me,” Rivera reflected on the head-kick knockout loss. “I learned from that fight.”  Had Jimmie Rivera won that fight, he would have put himself in line for a title shot. But while no one likes to be head kicked into unconsciousness, Rivera feels that the Sterling loss stung even worse:  “Sterling was the worst. I didn’t show up to fight,” Rivera said. There were so many things I could have done. Even my jiu-jitsu is really good. I work with some great guy,” he said. “I got on top of him a couple times and I didn’t do anything… Myself, my coaches were upset. That wasn’t me.”  But those losses are now a thing of the past, and Jimmie Rivera will be entering the Octagon Saturday night with mind afresh and a renewed vigor:  “So many thing have happened in life, personal, with my business and with fighting,” Rivera said. “Sometimes it’s hard to stay on track. That’s what I did for this camp. I just focused on this camp,” Rivera shared. “I took breaks when I needed to take breaks. I took mental days when I needed to. Petr Yan is a tough SOB and I’m excited for the fight.”  How do you believe Jimmie Rivera will bounce back at UFC 238 against Petr Yan?<|im_end|>

# New Fairfield puts on a clinic en route to 3rd straight Class S title

New Fairfield puts on a clinic en route to 3rd straight Class S title  MILFORD — Anyone looking for an instructional video on how to play team lacrosse should do this:  Find a copy of New Fairfield’s performance in the first half of Saturday’s Class S girls state championship game against Stonington at Law High School.  To say the top-seeded Rebels put on a clinic would be an injustice. New Fairfield forced turnovers, won draws, made crisp clearing passes, scooped up groundballs and moved the ball around quickly.  Oh yeah ... the Rebels also scored goals. Lots of them.  Fourteen straight, in fact, to open the contest and send New Fairfield on its way to an 18-5 triumph over third-seeded Stonington and a third consecutive Class S title.  Sports Videos  “We really prepared for this,” New Fairfield coach Karen Nell said. “We broke down the game into pieces and worked on each part and they executed it perfectly. Perfectly.”  Less than 10 minutes into the contest, New Fairfield was ahead 8-0. Two more goals and the lead reached double digits, sending the game clock into running time with 9:13 still to play. Four more goals and it was 14-0 before Stonington got the final goal of the opening half.  The Rebels’ trademark scoring balance was on display, as nine players contributed goals and/or assists during the 14-0 run. Katelyn Sousa and Reagan Tenaglia each had three goals, and Danielle Hernandez, Katelyn Nieves and Daria Bock added two goals apiece.  Equally impressive were New Fairfield defenders Eileen Rattigan, MaryMargaret Orloff, Maddie McCollam, Ailis Wargin and Jordan Siemonsen, and goalie Rachel Mikolay, who made eight of her nine saves in the opening half. Two of Mikolay’s stops came during the first three minutes, as she denied Stonington’s Hannah Lamb and Kate Johnson on free positions to keep the game scoreless.  “Our defense hasn’t given up more than seven goals except for one time ... our only loss of the season (11-10 to Staples),” Nell said. “We’re pretty tough and obviously we have an amazing goalie who takes care of us.”  “We worked really hard on our transitions because we weren’t doing that great on them, and we also worked a lot on offense and creating motion,” Mikolay said. “On defense we were just focused on making sure we had the cutter and we were prepared.”  The Bears began the second half with four unanswered goals — two apiece from Kate Johnson and Hannah Lamb — cutting their deficit to 14-5 and prompting Nell to call a timeout with 14:29 remaining.  When play resumed, New Fairfield regained control. The Rebels scored four goals in six minutes and held Stonington scoreless to close out the victory.  “We knew it was going to be tough, but we didn’t have a great first half ... we thought we could play better than that,” Stonington coach Jeff Medeiros said. “It’s tough when you get down that much to a team like New Fairfield. They do everything well.”  Player of the Game  Rachel Mikolay, New Fairfield. The senior goalie, who will play at Elon University next year, finished with nine saves, including five on free positions for Stonington.  Quoatable  “I couldn’t ask for anything more. They did everything we wanted them to do.” — New Fairfield coach Karen Nell on her team.  NEW FAIRFIELD 18, STONINGTON 5  STONINGTON 1 4 — 5  NEW FAIRFIELD 14 4 — 18  Scoring: New Fairfield - Daria Bock 2g, 5a; Katelyn Sousa 4g, 2a; Reagan Tenaglia 4g, 2a; Katelyn Nieves 3g, 3a; Danielle Hernandez 2g, 2a; Nicole Berry 2g; Julianna Guzi 1g; Samantha Ruggiero 1a; Jordan Siemonsen 1a. Stonington - Hannah Lamb 3g; Kate Johnson 2g, 1a; Emma Sabbadini 2a. Saves: New Fairfield - Rachel Mikolay 9; Stonington - Isabella McCarthy 5, Faith Gately 2.

# Lee6 holds onto one-shot lead at ShopRite Classic

Lee6 holds onto one-shot lead at ShopRite Classic  South Korea's Jeongeun Lee6, coming off her first major championship win at the U.S. Women's Open, fired a 2-under-par 69 on Saturday to stay in front of the field after Round 2 of the ShopRite LPGA Classic in Galloway, N.J.  Lee6, who stands at 10-under 132, leads by a shot at the Seaview Golf Club over Mariah Stackhouse (who shot 67) and two shots over a trio tied for third place at 8 under including No. 4-ranked Lexi Thompson (70), Ally McDonald (67) and Denmark's Nanna Koerstz Madsen (68).  Lee6, the world's fifth ranked player, had an up-and-down round that opened with a birdie-bogey-birdie start. She made the turn at 1 under but dropped two shots with back-to-back bogeys on Nos. 14 and 15. Lee6 finished strong with a birdie at 17 and an eagle at the par-5 18th to put herself in position for a second straight win.  "I kind of wanted to finish strong, and I did, so I'm pretty satisfied with it," said Lee6, who is aiming to become just the fifth player in LPGA history to win the U.S. Women's Open and the tournament immediately after it. Meg Mallon was the last player to do so in 2004.  "I am so glad that a lot of Korean fans are here supporting me and cheering for me. I'm just really happy with that, and so you know, tomorrow, the final round, I'm sure it will be a little more crowded. My goal is wanting to show them -- have a good round, have a good time with everyone, and also, I know I'm going to be a little bit nervous, but I know I'm going to do well tomorrow."  Stackhouse, the 25-year-old Stanford standout in just her third year on the LPGA Tour, has made just two cuts in her previous 10 starts this season but credited her solid play to the confidence she gained from her top-10 finish at last year's event.  "I think that one of the benefits (of) tournaments that you come back to year-in and year-out, or once you have a solid couple rounds out there, you know it's possible to string it together on that course ... and I've done that and I've followed it up again," said Stackhouse, who had five birdies and one bogey on the day. "You know that it's a course that when you're striking it well, it's friendly to you, and it makes you a lot more calm when you come out, definitely."  Thompson, who tied for second at last week's U.S. Women's Open, may have had the most eventful round of the day.  After opening with a double bogey at the first and a bogey at the second, she rebounded with an eagle at the par-5 third before settling into a stretch of four pars. She got momentum rolling again with three straight birdies on Nos. 8-10, but stumbled with bogeys at 13 and 17 before finishing with a birdie at 18.  Koerst Madsen had one bogey and four birdies in her round, including one to cap her day at the 18th.  Defending champion Annie Park shot 3-over 74 and stands tied for 75th at 1-over 143.  --Field Level Media Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.<|im_end|>

# Justin Bieber challenges Tom Cruise to MMA fight

Justin Bieber has bizarrely challenged Tom Cruise to a fight with a post on Twitter on Sunday. Much to the confusion of his 106 million followers on the social media platform, Justin tweeted: “I wanna challenge Tom Cruise to fight in the octagon. Tom if you dont take this fight your (sic) scared and you will never live it down.” He concluded his post by tagging Dana White, the head of the UFC (United Fighting Championship), writing: “Who is willing to put on the fight? @danawhite ?” White has yet to respond to Justin’s request. However, UFC fighter Conor McGregor has already stepped in and offered up his services, tweeting in reply: “If Tom Cruise is man enough to accept this challenge, McGregor Sports and Entertainment will host the bout. Does Cruise have the sprouts to fight, like he does in the movies? Stay tuned to find out!” While the Sorry star’s tweet raised some eyebrows, sources close to the singer told The Blast that he “doesn’t actually want to fight (Tom) himself… he was just having a little fun on social media.” And that’s probably just as well, considering the response from his Twitter followers. Many pointed out the age difference between Justin, 25, and Tom, 56, with one writing: “Tom Cruise is almost 60, were there no 80 year olds to pick a fight with? And BTW he’d still kick your a*s.” Another pointed out that if Justin’s tweet was a publicity bid, it failed, tweeting: “The best part about this is that Tom Cruise is the one trending…not @justinbieber . That’s gotta sting….” Tom has yet to publicly respond to Justin’s fight request.<|im_end|>

# Speakership: Coalition of 35 political parties backs Gbajabiamila – The Sun Nigeria

Samuel Bello, Abuja  A new coalition of 35 registered political parties, the Integrity Political Parties (CIPP), has expressed support for Femi Gbajabiamila to become the speaker of the House of Representatives.  The group’s spokesman, Dr Yakubu Shendam, stated this at the weekend during its inaugural world press conference on the state of the nation in Abuja.  He expressed dismay over the unhealthy approach, utterances and unnecessary legal and media attacks on Gbajabiamila.  Shendam, who is also the National Chairman of New Generation Party (NGP), said Gbajabiamila is not only a fine legislator but a respected one across two chambers of the National Assembly, ’Thus well deserving of his personality, capacity and experience in assuming the mantle of leadership’’.  “CIPP wishes to use this opportunity to announce our firm and unequivocal choice and support for the candidature of Femi Gbajabiamila as the Speaker of the Ninth House of Representatives.  “It will be considered foolhardy that a respected Nigerian citizen who has been elected to the House of Representatives on three occasions and Majority Leader of the House, with all security screenings conducted and concluded without any incident, could be besieged by these lightweight political folks.  ‘‘They should have deployed such energies in winning elections for their political parties to the green chamber in order to have legitimacy in the tussle for who becomes the Speaker of the House.  “All operations of the coalition have been geared towards ensuring successful actualisation of this project and for a better leadership of the House of Representatives and by extension, translate into meaningful policy development and administration for all Nigerians,” he said.  Shendam said CIPP represents a clear breakaway from the old antagonist order of reckless political, verbal and unethical media attacks on the person and office of the president and other respected Nigerian leaders who share in a singleness of commitment.  “It is on this premise that the leaders of all thirty-five political parties thought it wise to this day, {7th of June 2019,} proclaim to all Nigerians and the world at large, the formal formation and establishment of CIPP.”  He further assured that the coalition is very much disposed to deploy all machineries of the various affiliated political parties to play active and responsive participation in making Nigeria a better place.<|im_end|>

# Renault boosted by Ricciardo form ahead of home Grand Prix

Daniel Ricciardo hopes to put on a show at Renault's home French Grand Prix this month after the team doubled their season's points tally in Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix. The Australian finished sixth in Montreal, the seventh race of the year, with German teammate Nico Hulkenberg a close seventh. "The weekend as a whole pretty awesome. Qualified fourth, finished sixth," Ricciardo told Sky Sports. "I'm sure if you'd said to (team boss) Cyril (Abiteboul) before the weekend 'how does this result sound?' He would have probably kissed you. I think we've got to be really happy with that." Renault were eighth overall in the championship before the seventh round of the season but moved up to fifth, on 28 points and just two behind McLaren, who use the same engines. Sunday was the team's first double points finish of the campaign. The next race up is Le Castellet on June 23, with Renault hoping to show clear progress by then after a difficult start to the season. Abiteboul told reporters in Monaco last month Renault had fixed a fundamental engine problem that had slowed both Ricciardo and Hulkenberg and they were now back to full power. "We've certainly got some momentum now and the last few weekends have been stronger," said Ricciardo, who joined from Red Bull at the end of last season. "We've got a few new parts coming." The Australian said he had also been buoyed by keeping Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas, second in the championship to teammate Lewis Hamilton, behind for a number of laps and making him fight to get past. "I think the encouraging thing was for sure a few elbows out with Bottas," he said. "Our straight line speed is certainly much more competitive in race conditions. A lot of positives to take. "We'll see how we go in France. (Hopefully) for the Renault home fans we can pull off another good one." Reuters<|im_end|>

# Arsene Wenger pins hopes on Alexis Sanchez and Alexandre Lacazette forming lethal link-up

ARSENE WENGER is banking on Alexis Sanchez and Alexandre Lacazette striking up a deadly partnership for Arsenal.  Sanchez is fit again and available for today’s Premier League clash at Liverpool — and it opens up the mouth-watering prospect of the Chilean playing alongside £44million club-record buy Lacazette.  Gunners boss Wenger has vowed to do all he can to keep Sanchez at the Emirates for the final year of his contract and persuade him to sign a new deal.  And the Frenchman hopes Lacazette’s arrival will convince Sanchez that, as a strike partnership, they can rip defences apart and seriously compete for the title. He said: “Their co-operation looks promising. The two are good goalscorers, good finishers, good passers, have good assists — that means they can find each other.  “The rest will be more about the desire to play with each other, but usually the good players have that.”  When Luis Suarez moved from Liverpool to Barcelona three years ago, many wondered how well he would do with Neymar and Lionel Messi alongside him.  And Wenger admitted: “That was the question we all had when Suarez went to Barcelona and they had Neymar and Messi. “I had a conversation with ­Javier Mascherano before the ­season when Suarez moved there.  “We both came to the conclusion if it works, it’ll be fantastic, but it can be as well a disaster because they can kill each other.  “But one of the qualities of ­Suarez is he manages to get the best out of people around him. He did that at Liverpool. You had Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling — they scored over 100 goals.  “And that is a quality that is important and sometimes you cannot measure so much because you only look at the number of goals a guy has scored.  “But sometimes the way he can marry with people around him decides the quality of the team. And I think Sanchez and Lacazette should be able to do that. All the ingredients are there.”  Wenger believes that although Lacazette must adapt to English football, his Arsenal team-mates need to adapt to him.  He said: “Alexandre is a player when you look at his numbers, his assist numbers are good as well and he’s not an absolutely obsessed, selfish striker.  “You have many types of strikers and he is the one who is more of a combination player than a finisher. But if you look at his numbers, the quantity of his finishing compared to the rest of Europe is a bit below.  “That means he plays more in situations where he could have taken a shot rather than pass to others. He is a guy who doesn’t shoot a lot but, when he shoots, he finishes.  “You think sometimes during games, ‘Where is he?’ but when you watch the game again, you see he made a good pass here or his team-mates haven’t found him.  most read in football “The team needs to adapt to him and it can take three or four months.”  Wenger admits that Lacazette has had a shock introduction to English football but has no doubt he will be a big success.  He added: “Alexandre is still in an ­adaptation period to the team and to the league. He’s a bit surprised by the intensity of it all in training and in the games.  “He will get there because he is brave and intelligent. The intelligence of his runs and the quality of his technique is very good. Overall I don’t worry for him.  “At the start he was completely taken by the intensity of it and he slowly adapts. I feel every week he is getting better.”  One thing though that is clear already to Wenger is that ­Lacazette has settled in with his team-mates off the pitch and is in a positive frame of mind.  The Gunners boss said: “He’s friendly with everybody. He looks a naturally friendly guy. He comes from a Caribbean family and they are quite extrovert, he smiles ­easily and is a happy boy.”  Arsenal paid Lyon £44m and Wenger added: “I believe he is a bargain compared to the fees being paid for strikers now.”  Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp agrees and is also a fan of summer free transfer Sead Kolasinac, who played against him while the defender was at Schalke.  Klopp said: “They made good signings. SK is a good signing. Lacazette, of course pretty much the whole world thought about him and Arsene got him. A really good team.”  Klopp expects a tough afternoon trying to get the ball from Arsenal.  He added: “We compete for the same ball and then they can play football.  “They are all involved. Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez . . . Walcott, Giroud, Lazacette.  “It’s really difficult to step in but that is part of the game, you cannot play a little bit of football and hope you get anything from Arsenal — they are too strong.”  Keep up to date with ALL the transfer news and gossip on our blog<|im_end|>

# Army Vet To Become Iraq War’s First Living Medal Of Honor Recipient

President Donald Trump will award the Medal of Honor to former Army Staff Sgt. David Bellavia this month, making him the first living veteran of the Iraq War to receive the country’s highest military decoration, the White House said Monday. The Medal of Honor, given to members of the armed forces for distinguished service and bravery, has previously been awarded to five veterans of the Iraq War — all posthumously. Bellavia, 43, will receive the award in a June 25 White House ceremony for his service as a squad leader in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004. When his squad was pinned down by enemy insurgents, Bellavia provided cover fire that saved the lives of the entire squad, according to the White House. “He quickly exchanged an M16 rifle for an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, entered the house where his squad was trapped, and engaged insurgents, providing cover fire so that he and his fellow soldiers could exit safely,” the White House said in a statement. Bellavia later attacked the house alone with an M16, killing at least four enemy fighters. In his six years in the U.S. Army, Bellavia also served in Kosovo. He was released from duty in 2005. In 2018, Bellavia ran as a candidate in the GOP primary for New York’s 27th Congressional District, but withdrew from the race before the election. He’s now a radio host for WBEN in Buffalo, New York.<|im_end|>

Tamil Nadu minister S P Velumani called on Union Commerce and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal in Delhi on Monday and presented a host of demands concerning the state, including release of grant under the 14th Finance Commission. Velumani, the minister for Municipal Administration and Rural Development, said Tamil Nadu has been at the forefront in execution of rural development schemes and is also known for complying with directives of the Union Ministry of Rural Development.  During his brief interaction with Goyal, Velumani requested him to release the performance grant of Rs 560.15 crore for 2017-18 and the second installment of Rs 1,608.03 crore for 2018-19 for the rural and urban local bodies of the state under the 14th Finance Commission, an official statement said.

# Gillibrand wallops de Blasio for president in latest poll

STATEN ISLAND -- New Yorkers would pick Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand over Mayor Bill de Blasio by a wide margin for president, according to a poll released Monday. Among the three New Yorkers running for president including President Donald Trump, Gillibrand did the best, according to the Siena College poll.  “New York Democrats strongly prefer the hometown senator over the hometown mayor. Gillibrand would easily best de Blasio in every region of the state, including New York City,” said Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg. According to the poll, Gillibrand led de Blasio 56 to 29 percent. Even among liberal Democrats, Gillibrand led de Blasio 69 to 18 percent and among older voters the New York senator led by more than 40 percent. Only 29 percent of voters said they would re-elect Trump, while 68 percent said they preferred “someone else.” In hypothetical matchups, Gillibrand led Trump by 24 points and de Blasio led Trump by 12 points, although he did not hit 50 percent. The latest polling came on the heels of a poll released over the weekend of likely Democratic Iowa caucus-goers which found that de Blasio was one of just two Democratic candidates who caucus-goers said would not be their first or second choice for president. Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden was caucus-goers’ top pick for president in the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll. FOLLOW SYDNEY KASHIWAGI ON TWITTER.<|im_end|>

# Article 356 buzz as Modi, Shah meet Bengal governor

Banerjee claimed the advisories were being sent to the state to stop her from investigating cases of electoral malpractices.  New Delhi: The bitter battle over West Bengal moved to the nation’s capital on Monday as governor Keshari Nath Tripathi met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah and apprised them of the situation in the state, that is in the grip of political violence since the Lok Sabha polls. Speculation is rife in Opposition circles that the Centre may be planning to impose President’s Rule in the state ahead of the Assembly elections due in 2021.  However, the governor, who met the PM and Mr Shah, told the media that there was no discussion on imposing President’s Rule. “I have apprised the Prime Minister and the home minister about the situation in West Bengal. I can’t disclose details,” he said.  Mr Tripathi’s visit to New Delhi came a day after the Centre issued an advisory to the West Bengal government over the relentless political violence in the state following the general election, in which the BJP managed to wrest 18 Lok Sabha seats in the state, and the ruling Trinamul Congress’ Lok Sabha tally fell to 22 from 34.  Reacting to the governor’s visit to New Delhi, state chief minister and Trinamul Congress boss Mamata Banerjee claimed that the BJP government at the Centre wanted to “turn Bengal into another Gujarat”. She also evoked Bengali pride and said she would not allow her state’s image to be hurt.  “Who is planning to disturb the peace in Darjeeling and Jangalmahal? Is there not a conspiracy to turn West Bengal into another Gujarat? I request the Centre not to play with fire. Who came from Bangladesh to canvass for the BJP? Is infiltration only by the minorities? This is a planted game,” she said in Kolkata.  Ms Banerjee claimed the advisories were being sent to the state to stop her from investigating cases of electoral malpractices.  On Sunday, in an advisory, the home ministry expressed “deep concern” over the continuing violence in West Bengal, saying the “unabated violence” even after the Lok Sabha polls were over appears to be a failure on the part of the state government.  The Trinamul Congress government in the state had hit back at the Centre saying there were a few “stray post-poll clashes” in West Bengal, and that the situation in the state was “under control”.  Arch-rivals CPI(M), meanwhile, said though the law and order situation in West Bengal was bad, President’s Rule should not be imposed in the state. “In principle, we have always been against President’s Rule. The law and order situation in Bengal is bad, but it does not mean that President’s Rule is imposed in the state,” said CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury.  Sources in the party, however, blamed the Trinamul Congress for the BJP’s stunning performance, saying a large number of anti-incumbency votes turned to the BJP due to the violence unleashed by her after the panchayat polls last year.  The BJP, on its part, said it was not demanding that President’s Rule be imposed, but it would “defy” the Trinamul Congress government’s curbs on its political programmes, including victory processions.  The ruling Trinamul Congress took out victory marches in the seats where it had won in the Lok Sabha polls, but the state government prohibited the saffron party from doing so by imposing Section 144 CrPC, which bars any assembly of five or more people, on the ground that it may lead to violence, BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said.  The BJP has announced a protest in the state on June 12 against the killings of its workers, allegedly by people who are linked to the TMC.<|im_end|>

# NBA Finals 2019: Draymond Green on Warriors' Game 5 performance - 'I think it’s got to be the greatest'

In Toronto for Game 5 of the NBA Finals, the Golden State Warriors' season was on the line and possibly, even their dynasty.  But with their backs against the wall and needing to overcome multiple adversities, the two-time reigning champions continued to battle and eventually staved off elimination with a one-point win. "I think it's got to be the greatest," Draymond Green said postgame of their performance. Draymond Green, often considered the heart and soul of the team, believed the Warriors' performance in Game 5 has got be the greatest of their recent championship run. "When you're down six with a couple minutes to go in an elimination for these guys to win a championship, we could have thrown in the towel. We could have folded, but we didn't. I said it before: I've never seen this group fold. And that stands true still." Playing at center in the team's small ball starting line-up, Green finished just two assists shy of a second triple-double for the series.  💪 @Money23Green (10 PTS, 10 REB, 8 AST) does a little bit of everything as the @warriors win Game 5 in Toronto! #StrengthInNumbers #NBAFinals - NBA (@NBA) June 11, 2019 Game 6: Thursday (6/13), 9pm/et, ABC & TSN pic.twitter.com/xpbAKbnC4k After playing 12 minutes, Kevin Durant was forced to head to the locker room and did return to the game, suffering an Achilles injury. The Warriors injury bug continued to plague them in Game 5, with key rotation big man Kevon Looney missing most of the second half after re-aggravating his upper body injury. Golden State's head coach Steve Kerr credited his team's fight and resilience to force a Game 6 in the face of adversity. "They have accomplished so much over the years, and that doesn't just happen and it doesn't just happen with talent," Kerr said post-game. "There has to be more that goes into it and it's that fight, that competitive desire that I talked about and that ability to stay poised under pressure. It was brilliant to watch." Stephen Curry, who led his team with 31 points, echoed those sentiments, telling reporters that the Warriors just let their play do the talking.  "We want to win this championship," Curry said. "We're going to give everything we got, but I think we're done with proving people wrong or making bold statements with our play, people know who we are." Curry also had a near triple-double with eight rebounds and seven assists. As the shifts back to Oakland for Game 6, can the Warriors force a decisive Game 7 or will the Raptors clinch the franchise's first championship on the road?<|im_end|>

# Detour Planned at I-84/86 Interchange Project East of Burley

Detour Planned at I-84/86 Interchange Project East of Burley TWIN FALLS, Idaho (KLIX)- If you plan to head towards Pocatello this Tuesday from the Magic Valley area you will run into a detour at a major interchange under construction near Declo. The Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) announced plans to reroute traffic at the Salt Lake Interchange project east of Burley Tuesday night beginning at 9 p.m. and extending to 6 a.m. Wednesday morning. The detour will impact eastbound travelers headed towards Pocatello only as crews will work on putting in steel girders for the new bridge. A map provided by ITD shows eastbound traffic will be detoured to the south (as if they were headed to Salt Lake City) to the Yale Road Exit and then double back to the interchange to continue eastward (see map below). The project began in May last year and should be completed later next year. ITD says people driving should continue to watch for reduced speeds in the work zone and pay close attention to signs directing traffic.<|im_end|>

# LG considers selling stakes in IT arm | Yonhap News Agency

SEOUL, June 11 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's major family-controlled conglomerate LG Group said Tuesday it is currently considering selling stakes in its information technology (IT) arm LG CNS. "We plan to sell LG CNS to beef up competitiveness, although nothing in detail has been decided yet," an official from LG Group said. The sale apparently comes in response to the Fair Trade Commission's move to bolster regulations against intra-affiliate trades of family-controlled business groups, market watchers said. Companies at which 20 percent or more of shares are owned by controlling families are subject to tougher regulations. The upcoming measure includes affiliates in which more than 50 percent of shares are owned by such firms.  Accordingly, LG needs to sell more than 35 percent of its stakes in LG CNS to avoid the new regulations.  colin@yna.co.kr (END)<|im_end|>

# Suspect in shooting of David Ortiz to face judge in Dominican Republic

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (WHDH) — One of the suspects behind the shooting of former Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz at a bar in the Dominican Republic over the weekend is expected to be arraigned Tuesday on a charge of being an accomplice to attempted murder.  Ortíz was dining at the Dial Bar and Lounge in Santo Domingo, an open-air hotspot, on Sunday and had his back to the sidewalk as a gunman — a passenger on a motorcycle — got off the bike just before 9 p.m., approached the 43-year-old retired athlete and fired a single shot at close range before escaping, according to Dominican Republic National Police.  The motorcyclist, later identified as 25-year-old Eddy Feliz Garcia, was tackled by a crowd after the shooting and handed over to the police.  Police say Ortiz was shot in the back. The bullet pierced his stomach.  Eliezar Salvador, who was at Dial Bar and Lounge at the time of the shooting, saw Ortiz on the ground and rushed to help him.  “When he fell on the ground, I said give me your hand,” he told 7News. “I pulled him towards me and then I pushed him into my car.”  Salvador says he had to drive into other cars in order to get Ortiz to the hospital because his SUV was trapped between other vehicles.  “I would reach back grabbing his hand and driving with the other,” Salvador said of the ride to the hospital.  Salvador told 7’s Nathalie Pozo that he saw the shooter and that it wasn’t the man who was beaten by the crowd.  Doctors in Santo Domingo removed Ortiz’s gallbladder and part of his intestines. An air ambulance was sent to the island by the Red Sox and was then flown to Boston for further treatment Monday night, undergoing two hours of exploratory surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital.  Ortiz is said to be “stable, awake, and resting comfortably.”  Reports indicate Ortiz does not know Feliz Garcia, who has a criminal record involving drug trafficking.  A spokesperson for the three-time World Series champion, who is fondly called “Big Papi” by fans, doesn’t think the shooting was a robbery attempt.  The motive for the shooting is unknown.

# How Difficult is Recovery from the Labiaplasty Procedure?

If you are considering undergoing the labiaplasty procedure, one of your greatest concerns might be just how difficult the recovery period is going to be. After all, this is a major surgery being done on a very sensitive part of your body. The labiaplasty procedure is growing in popularity as more women feel confident discussing their discomfort and embarrassment over the way that their labia look and feel. It is considered to be a very safe and very effective procedure that offers the patient both cosmetic and good functional benefit.  Recovering from surgery, the first few days The procedure is typically done on an outpatient basis, and you’ll be sent home to recover in comfort once the anaesthesia has worn off. There will be significant swelling and possibly bruising. It’s important that you don’t have the expectation that your labia and the surrounding area will look normal at all. The swelling may even look alarming at first. But it will subside. Applying a cold compress to the area for up to 15 minutes at a time will help to reduce the swelling and also help with the relief of pain. You may have prescription pain relievers, and you should use them if you feel the need to. One of the tips that labiaplasty specialist Dr. Perron offers to his patients is to use a spray bottle filled with cool water when you need to urinate. While this may seem like a silly thing to do, the water will actually help to dilute the urine. Without this, you may feel much more stinging over your incisions. The spray bottle will also help keep you clean so that you can avoid using anything potentially abrasive over your tender skin. Walking and extended periods of sitting may cause discomfort and even pain. Be sure that you can take time off from work for at least the first week after your procedure. How long will the postoperative pain last? By the end of the first week, your pain should have drastically subsided. It’s normal to feel some discomfort for up to a month after surgery, but it should be much more manageable after that first week has passed. Be sure to call your surgeon if the pain is unbearable if you experience excessive drainage or fever. These could be signs of an infection. What else can be expected during recovery? Many patients experience swelling and itching as their incisions heal. The swelling can be seen typically after just about every surgical procedure, as it’s often one of the ways that the body promotes healing after any sort of physical trauma. The swelling will be at its worst around the second and third days after the procedure but then should subside gradually as the weeks go by. Itching is normal, to a degree. It shouldn’t last past the first week, however. If the itching does persist, it’s important that you meet with your surgeon, as itching could be a sign of an infection or allergic reaction that you will need to get treated. Are there any things to do to speed the healing process? Perhaps the best thing that you can do in order to ensure you heal at a healthy pace is to follow the postoperative instructions provided to you by your surgeon. Minimise your activity for the first week after surgery so that you can allow your body to heal at its own healthy pace. It’s important not to be completely stationary, as you want to keep your blood flowing and your body moving slowly after any type of surgical procedure. Cold compresses can help to reduce the swelling, and your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic healing ointment for you to use. Be sure that you are eating a healthy diet and staying hydrated, as this can go a long way toward ensuring that your body is healthy enough to heal without complication.<|im_end|>

# Everything About Boris Johnson Is Phony | Independent Newspapers Nigeria

Rather rashly, Boris Johnson published The Churchill Factor: How One Man Made History in 2015. It was without historical merit, or intellectual insight, but Johnson did not intend readers to learn about Churchill. The biography was not a Churchill biography but a Johnson campaign biography, where we were invited to see our hero as Winston redux, According to Spectator.us.  Both ignored party discipline and conventional routes of advancement, after all. Both were great company. Churchill stayed in the wilderness for years making a fortune from journalism, and so has Johnson. Churchill was a man of principle and so is…  Hold on. That doesn’t work. It doesn’t work at all. For when we talk of principle, the elaborate scaffolding Johnson has erected around himself, the scenery and props, the spotlights and the cameras, fall with a thundering crash. All that remains on stage is a jobbing actor who can play any part convincingly except himself.  The cult of Churchill can be remarkably selective. Certainly, Churchill and others fought appeasement. But he was also the most implacable of diehard imperialists. However I will give him this: Churchill meant what he said – and was prepared to suffer when his beliefs were out of fashion.  Johnson believes in the advance of Johnson. That’s all there is. There’s nothing else. Most politicians, and many of the rest of us, are ambitious, of course. But politicians normally hope to advance a cause as they advance themselves. Johnson would have you believe that he is breaking with the establishment, risking all, because of his sincere conviction that we must advance the cause of saving Britain from the European Union.  His colleagues do not believe him. Nicholas Soames has called him a liar on Twitter. Jerry Hayes called him a ‘copper-bottomed, hypocritical little shit.’ The wonder of it is that they may have been understating the case for the prosecution.  After the Times fired him for making up stories, Johnson ended up as the Telegraph’s Brussels correspondent. Once there, he was seduced by the most corrupting desire to afflict a journalist: the urge to give readers what they want. His tales of the EU punishing the rubber industry for making undersized condoms or ordering the straightening of bananas were so flimsy that, like dandelion puffballs, they collapsed with the first puff of scrutiny. They were a hit with his right-wing readers, but no one who knew him at the time thought that Johnson believed what he was writing. David Usborne, the Independent’s man in Brussels, told Johnson’s acidic biographer Sonia Purnell:  ‘He played the Telegraph game brilliantly [and] compromised his intellectual integrity to get on. I assume that he has done that in the rest of his career.’  Curiously, when he entered parliament in 2001, Johnson stopped playing the right-wing nationalist from the Telegraph foreign desk and presented himself as liberal Tory. Chris Cook, an aide to David Willetts, told Purnell:  ‘He was clearly not on the right wing, but actually quite europhile in Tory terms. He liked to come into our office to gossip and bitch about the right-wingers he thought had screwed up the party.’  As Mayor of London, Johnson never called emergency conferences on the alleged EU tyranny, which surely must have fettered him, if it was as oppressive as he is now claiming. He never allied with Daniel Hannan, Charles Moore, Nigel Farage, George Galloway, Bill Cash and the rest of the ‘out’ crowd. The subject was of no interest to him – until he returned to Parliament to concentrate on the sole subject that does interest him: the leadership of the Conservative party.  If you doubt his slipperiness, examine his supposed declaration of support for withdrawal in 2016. It is not as unequivocal as it seems. A crucial line tied Johnson to a fantasy pushed by Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott of the Tory campaign group Vote Leave:  ‘There is only one way to get the change we need and that is to vote to go, because all EU history says that they only really listen to a population when it says no.’  We will vote to leave, in other words, but we will not actually go, because the EU will give us more.  To Johnson watchers, his shiftiness was no surprise. At Oxford he ran for the presidency of the Oxford Union as a Tory. He lost to a state school boy called Neil Sherlock, a liberal, who secured victory by mocking the old Etonian’s sense of entitlement.  In 1985, Johnson tried again and won, but now and all of sudden Johnson was a liberal too, who was opposed to Margaret Thatcher and in favor of proportional representation. Johnson has ‘no core beliefs’ an understandably flabbergasted Sherlock concluded. He would do anything.  The same disease afflicts him now. Charlatans from Donald Trump to Piers Morgan invite us to forget about our own concerns and revel vicariously in their career-advancing machinations, in much the same way that TV crime capers invite you to celebrate conmen and despise their gormless marks. So I beg you do not admire Johnson’s maneuvers as he climbs to the top over the bodies of his colleagues. Just understand them lest you find yourself his mark one day.  As I have said before, Johnson bears few resemblances to Churchill, and far too many to Winston’s shifty sidekick Brendan Bracken, who became propaganda minister during the war. Bracken too was careless with the facts. He invented stories about his childhood to con his way into high society. He was an energetic manipulator of the press in both Churchill’s interest and his own. (Whenever he gave dinner parties he instructed his butler to make up a story that the prime minister was on the phone and announce the news loudly to his guests). Evelyn Waugh couldn’t stand him, and in Brideshead turned Bracken into Rex Motram, who marries the wealthy but naive Julia because ‘he wanted a woman; he wanted the best on the market, and he wanted her cheap; that was what it amounted to’. Inevitably, he betrays her, within in months of the honeymoon.  ‘Rex isn’t anybody at all,’ Julia concludes of Mottram/Bracken. ‘He just doesn’t exist.’  A fine line, which applies well to Johnson. But I prefer a snub the historian Piers Brendon credits to an unnamed journalist who met Bracken in a 1930s club. Growing ever more infuriated by Bracken’s trickiness and double-dealing, the unknown hack cried  ‘You’re phony! Everything about you is phony! Even your hair that looks like a wig – isn’t!’  Bracken had a mop of red hair to match Johnson’s mop of blond. The next time I see our future prime minister I will give it a good hard yank, just to check.<|im_end|>

# Revealed: Joey’s phone call to Junior as Blues prepare for Pearce resurrection

The Blues’ greatest halfback of all time, Andrew Johns, has picked up the phone to the No.7 that NSW believe can salvage the State of Origin series – and it’s Mitchell Pearce. Currently in career-best form with the Newcastle Knights and on a six-match winning roll, the Blues went close to turning to Pearce for the opening game of the series. As always, Johns was one of his biggest supporters. Live stream the 2019 NRL Telstra Premiership on KAYO SPORTS. Every game of every round live & anytime on your TV or favourite device. Get your 14 day free trial > EXILE FILES: Former NRL star denied entry into UK FIVE-ROUND FLIP: Crazy NRL ladder on recent form But a groin issue convinced NSW coach Brad Fittler to persevere with incumbent No.7 Nathan Cleary. While Cleary was “solid” in his fourth State of Origin appearance, there is a strong view NSW needs a more dominant and in-form playmaker who can also threaten with the ball. Which is why Johns, one of the Blues assistant coaches, has picked up the phone to Pearce. And the Knights playmaker is believed to have been all ears. The Blues also appear set to make up to five changes due to injury and form. MORE NRL NEWS ‘HE’LL BE A DISTRACTION’: Gould’s stern Origin warning over Latrell ‘KALYN LOVES NEWCASTLE’: Brown has faith in Ponga despite exit fears With no more second chances, it’s now firming that Pearce will be wearing the sky blue for NSW in State of Origin II in Perth. The caveat on all of this is Fittler will be wary of locking in any selections too early. When Fittler first took over coaching the Blues, Phil Gould famously told him: “Don’t pick your team too early”. There was never a truer word spoken leading into Origin I. Just 48 hours out from the team being named, chaos ensued when Luke Keary was badly knocked out and ruled out for up to six weeks due to concussion. The Blues were banking on a Keary-Nathan Cleary partnership. Then 24 hours later, after Pearce had been ruled out with a groin injury and the Blues had shifted to Cody Walker as five-eighth, Adam Reynolds suddenly came rocketing into contention. The obvious appeal was the South Sydney playmaking combination of Damien Cook, Walker and Reynolds. Midway through the first half against Wests Tigers, with Reynolds in career-best touch, the Rabbitohs No.7 came reeling out of a tackle clutching at his leg. Reynolds finished the night in a leg brace and the Blues went back to the drawing board before settling on a Cleary-Walker partnership. Which is now all ancient history as the Blues cast forward and try to square up the series 1-1. The football gods couldn’t have set it up any better for Pearce. On Saturday afternoon the Knights travel to Melbourne to take on Cameron Smith and Cameron Munster at AAMI Park. If Pearce steers the Knights to a seventh straight win, stop the fight. Sure, there will be a negative narrative from north of the border about Pearce’s Origin demons and his previous campaigns. In fairness, he was playing against a Queensland side containing Cameron Smith, Billy Slater, Johnathan Thurston, Greg Inglis and Cooper Cronk. Even some of the Blues’ greatest-ever champions would have struggled to beat these Maroons. The other predicted changes due to injury and form centre around the front row, outside backs and the bench. With forward pack leader David Klemmer ruled out with a broken wrist, Matt Lodge is on target to make his State of Origin debut. Tom Trbojevic’s return from a hamstring injury is also timely. Not that Nick Cotric was bad on debut but Trbojevic has far more big-game experience. Blues five-eighth Walker is fighting to save his spot, with Jack Wighton submitting a superb performance for the Raiders last Friday. Bench forward Angus Crichton is also playing for his spot, with the Blues possibly making as many as five changes when the team is announced on Sunday.<|im_end|>

# Boat captain faces 20 years in jail for rescuing migrants from the Mediterranean

A German boat captain faces 20 years in an Italian prison for rescuing drowning migrants who are fleeing war zones.  Pia Klemp said rescuing people had become ‘criminalised’ and condemned Italy for what she said would be a ‘year-long show trial.’  Pia’s supporters have hailed her as a humanitarian who has been personally responsible for hundreds of rescue missions.  But the Italian authorities have accused her in assisting illegal immigration and impounded her boat.  Pia, 35, said she is now prepared for a lengthy and expensive legal battle, which could end up in the EU court of human rights.  She added: ‘We are accused of aiding and abetting illegal entry. On it stands up to 20 years imprisonment and horrendous fines.  ‘We are facing a year-long show trial. The legal and legal costs alone will amount to over 300,000 euros (£266,000) plus travel and campaign costs.’  Italy, under the influence of far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini, has accused Pia of colluding with smugglers.  Pictures allegedly show human traffickers ‘escorting’ vessels packed with asylum seekers before they are transferred to aid boats.  Pia has said that these pictures were taken off the coast of Malta, not Italy, and said she always followed international law while captaining the Iuventa vessel.  Speaking to Swiss paper Basler Zeitung, she added: ‘We have only followed international law, especially the law of the sea, where the highest priority is to save people from distress.  ‘The rescue is criminalised. We are already paralysed. And that’s why people are dying on the Mediterranean.’  Since 2014, more than 12,000 people have died in the Mediterranean trying to flee Libya to Europe.  The UN refugee agency has called it the ‘world’s deadliest sea crossing.’  Pia already has the backing of some 80,000 people who have signed a petition urging Italy to drop the charges.  Petition organisers said that Pia’s imprisonment would represent ‘the surrender of humanity’ in Europe.  Pia, from Bonn, said she was ‘bitter’ that money raised for her defence could not be spent instead on rescue missions.  Salvini leads the powerful right-wing League party in the ruling coalition and has seen his popularity soar with his hard line stance.  He has repeatedly refused entry to Mediterranean migrants and turned away rescue ships operated by NGOs.<|im_end|>

Students from Rotherham College will be making an appearance on BBC Gardeners World after their volunteer work in Worksop.  Callum Gregory and Tommie Hamilton have been volunteering at the Oasis Community Gardens based in Worksop. The aim of Oasis Community Gardens is to improve the lives of those in the neighbouring community by offering social events and activities but also educational opportunities, including allowing volunteers to help in the gardens and grow their gardening skills. BBC Gardeners’ World have been filming at the Oasis Community Garden as part of a segment they are running on gardens within the community and the difference these gardens have on people’s lives and the surrounding community. Callum and Tommie, both based at Rotherham College Dinnington Campus, got involved in the filming by making hanging baskets with presenter, Adam Frost and were able to share their favourite things about volunteering at the Gardens. Callum said: “I love to do everything here at the garden, my favourite thing is to do the composting. We also get to play football here after we’ve done our gardening work. “At College, we have been learning about woodwork, cooking and gardening, but I really enjoy gardening so I love helping out at the Oasis Community Gardens. “I’m really excited to appear on Gardeners’ World, it’s really exciting to have a film crew with us.” Tommie said: “I love getting involved with everything there is to do here in the garden. “Sewing seeds is my favourite job but I also like planting and watering the plants.” The work Callum and Tommie are doing at the Oasis Community Gardens is a part of their ‘Tomorrow People’ award which was set up to inspire young people to get involved with making a difference in their community. Callum and Tommie have to complete a set number of volunteering hours and decided to work within the Oasis Community Garden as a result. Steve Williams, centre manager at the Oasis Community Garden, said: “The garden has over 20 regular volunteers and has come on a long way since being a derelict youth centre and abandoned playing field. “It wouldn’t have been possible without the help of volunteers like Callum and Tommie. “It’s really exciting that the Oasis Community Garden has the opportunity to appear on national television to showcase everyone’s hard work over the years.”<|im_end|>

Flash floods triggered by heavy rains washed away a bridge in Arin village of Bandipora connecting Arin with Bapora village. Several villages including Lowdara, Kulhama, Lankreshipora, Kunzpora and Gund Jahengeer were inundated due to incessant rains since Tuesday. Flash floods also damaged agricultural crops in Ajas, Lowdara, Kulhama and Kunzpora village. Water also entered several residential houses in these villages, causing fear among the residents. Flash floods also damaged several transmission lines in the area. Several houses were inundated in Kaloosa locality after water breach from Madumati stream, which prompted residents to stage an anti-administration protest.  They blocked Bandiproa-Sopore road to protest against the district administration, alleging use of sub-standard material in the construction of embankments. Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner Bandipora Shabaz Mirza along with a team of officers visited many affected villages to take the stock of the damage People in various villages of Bandipora district are spending sleepless nights amid the flood fear since Wednesday. Residents complain of weak embankments around various streams like Arin, Bonar, Ajas and Madhumati Nallahs. Inhabitants located around Wular Lake are also concerned about the increasing water level in the Lake, while low lying areas in many habitations like-Leharwalpora, Kulhama,Ningli,Kanyari,Kanbahti and Zooriman- are partially inundated after Wular Lake starts swelling due to continuous heavy raining Though the gauge the level at Asham is flowing below the normal level, however, Wular Lake is swelling after the increasing water level in incoming rivers like Madhumati, Arin, Ajas, Bonar and Nallah. The lower parts in hamlets located around Wular like Kulhama, Leharwalpora, Banyari, Zooranz and Kanibathi was inundated due to Wular waters. Though locals termed the increasing water level a routine matter but continuous rain has caused fears among them. Residents fear the swelling of river Jhelum and various streams like Madhumati and Arin Nallah will breach and flood their settlement anytime as the embankments around these streams are very weak.  “We fear the floods and destruction as embankments are weak at many spots around Arin Nallah “said Nazir Ahmed a resident of Shokbaba. “Most of the embankment portion near Shokbaba is worn out due to lack of maintenance and the gushing waters have started damaging the embankment,” the locals said. According to officials the embankments around the Arin Nallah from Shokhbaba to Gamooora and of Nallah Maduhmati from Shalhoi to Muslimabad are at high risk and remain vulnerable to breaches. The level of both streams at these portions is more than that of surrounding localities.  “We are not sure if it is going to withstand the water pressure,” locals residing around Mahdumati in Kaloosa said. Residents in Muslim Abad and Gamoora said the settlements have been facing flood problems since past 20 years and the administration has overlooked their plight. The looming threat of embankment breach along the Hajin, Sumbal, Preng, Madvan, Chrengpora and Mukhdamyari other adjoin area located around Jehulum poses great to the localities. Residents in villages like Banyari,Kanyari,Nangli, Markundal,Saidunara and other adjoining villages told Rising Kashmir that the increasing water level in in streams flowing from mountains into the Wular has created panicky as 2014 floods have washed most of the abatement's yet to be repaired. Although the administration claims of spending crores under Central Sponsored project to repair the embankments, many argue that it is just a temporary fix and that streams and canals coming under this project are still prone to flooding. The officer in the disaster Management wing told Rising Kashmir there are no reports of floods from any part of the district.  Deputy Commissioner Bandipora Shahbaz Mirza said the situation is not alarming and the administration has deputed teams to vulnerable areas. “Few areas are partially inundated where teams have been dispatched. There is nothing to worry as authorities are ready to face a situation,” he said.<|im_end|>

# United Technologies CEO: New aerospace giant has 'unlimited potential to grow'

Continue Reading Below “I know Bill [Ackman] and Dan [Loeb] are not perhaps happy with this deal because of the short-term dilution -- but you have to take the long view here,” said Hayes to Maria Bartiromo. “And as Tom and I have talked over these last 6 months, we have unlimited potential to grow this business through the innovation agenda, through all of these 60 thousand engineers we have. We have $8 billion in R&D. We will meet all of our customers’ needs and provide big value to our customers over time.” Raytheon and United Technologies announced plans to merge in an all-stock deal, that they call a merger of equals, creating a company named Raytheon Technologies Corporation that is expected to have $74 billion in sales annually. Activist investor Bill Ackman, in a letter to Hayes, wrote that the deal would “significantly lower the business quality” of its aerospace business. While Loeb also reportedly opposes the deal. Advertisement However Kennedy said the merger will allow the company to utilize underlying technology, which supports the defense and commercial parts of business. “I can’t imagine a better deal than coming together in a merger of equals where you bring two great companies together,” said Hayes. “And you can have not just great financial performance but putting innovation at the forefront of what customers want and need.” Although Hayes has not yet spoken to Ackman regarding his apprehensions, he said he plans to reach out over the “next day or two.” Raytheon produces defense technologies and Tomahawk missiles, and United Technologies makes Pratt & Whitney engines, which power the Airbus A320neo, Airbus A220-100 and -300 series as well as the F-35 fighter jet.

# Bengal post-poll violence: Governor calls meet of major parties

As the post-poll violence continues unabated in Bengal, Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi has called for a meeting of four major political parties at Raj Bhawan on Thursday, to ensure prevalence of peace in the state. The move from the Governor comes days after he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah and apprised them of the present law and order situation here.  “In the context of reported incidents of post-poll violence in the state, Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi has convened a meeting of four major political parties in West Bengal which will be useful in creating a harmonious situation whereby peace and harmony prevails in the State for the benefit of the citizens,” said a release issued by Governor’s press secretary.  “The meeting will be held at Rajbhavan on 13/06/2019 at 4 pm. The invitees are Dr. Partha Chatterjee (AITMC), Dilip Ghosh( BJP), Dr. Surjyakanto Mishra (CPM) and Soumendra Nath Mitra (Congress),” it read.  Not the first time Governor has stepped in This is not the first time Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi has decided to intervene. In 2017, he had stepped in and spoken to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee after a riot broke out at Baduria. The Chief Minister had then accused him of speaking like a BJP leader. Since then, the relationship between the state government and the Governor has remained strained. The BJP welcomed the Governor’s move and said its leaders will attend the meeting. “The Governor has played his role as the constitutional guardian of the state by convening the meeting. Our leaders will definitely attend it. We will place our statements before him,” said West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh. The TMC will also attend the meeting.  “Yes, the Governor has invited us for the meeting and our representative will attend it. There is no problem in that,” said TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee.  Responding to a query on this, Abhishek said, “I will place my question before the Governor of Uttar Pradesh that why should not President’s Rule be imposed there after 25 Yadavs were killed and a two-year-old girl was raped and killed? Journalists are being beaten up and arrested there. So, if President’s Rule is needed in Bengal, then it is also needed in Uttar Pradesh. There is a demand for this because the people of Bengal have not bowed their heads before the Centre.”  Commenting on the role of the Governor, Abhishek further said, “I respect the post of the Governor…A Governor is someone who should be representing the right picture of the state to the authorities concerned at the Centre. I would have appreciated if it would have taken place that way.”<|im_end|>

# Wendie Renard scores comical own goal for France v Norway in Women's World Cup

France made a terrific start to their home World Cup by beating South Korea 4-0 in the opening game of the tournament.  Next up, though, was a tough clash against Norway.  There may have been no goals in the opening 45 minutes, but it was end-to-end stuff.   But the second half soon came alive.  Valerie Gauvin scored within one minute of the restart to give the hosts the lead.  England v Scotland sets new UK audience record Nikita Parris not feeling pressure of WC debut More than 10m people watching France's opener But Norway found themselves level after a rather embarrassing own goal by Wendie Renard.  The centre-back scored twice against South Korea in the first game but inexplicably turned the ball into her own net under no pressure.  Well, we say no pressure. She’s got the pressure of an entire nation on her shoulders to be fair.  Funnily enough, a report emerged before the match that Norway had been preparing to face the 6'2" defender in training with the help of the team's media manager, Terje Skeie.  "It's absolutely true that we have used him," manager Martin Sjogren confirmed. "He can do a little of everything. Today he was Renard... but I actually think Renard is better off than Terje is."  Turns out Renard wasn't a danger in Norway's penalty area but her own...  Renard was rescued by Eugenie Le Sommer and VAR, though.  France were awarded a controversial penalty with 20 minutes remaining, which Le Sommer stuck away.  They held on to make it six points from their first two games and secure qualification into the knockout stages.  Next up for France is Nigeria, with Les Bleus hoping to make it three wins out of three to conclude their group stage.<|im_end|>

# PICTURED: Backpacker who was kidnapped and raped by a pig farmer

Belgian backpacker is pictured for the first time as she reveals how she escaped the Gumtree rapist who chained her up in a pig shed and put a gun against her back in horrific attack Davine, 24, was kidnapped and raped on a remote farm in South Australia The backpacker was promised work on the farm by Gene Bristow, 54 She has spoken out about how she managed to alert authorities and survive The Belgian used hooks in the pig shed where she was being held to break free She sent distress signals to family and friends, as well as SA Police Davine (pictured) has spoken about how she escaped the violent Gumtree rapist A backpacker who was chained up in a pig shed by the Gumtree rapist has spoken for the first time and revealed how she escaped her attacker. Davine, 24, from Belgium posted a Gumtree advertisement seeking short-term work in Australia. She was offered employment on a remote pig farm in Meningie, 150km southeast of Adelaide, in February 2017 but when she arrived her nightmare began. Gene Charles Bristow, 54, kidnapped her after pressing what turned out to be a fake gun against her back. 'He was telling me to stop moving and stay still but I wouldn't let him. I was struggling and he put something against my back,' she told 60 Minutes. Davine, 24, posted a Gumtree advertisement seeking short term work and was offered employment on a remote pig farm in Meningie, 150km southeast of Adelaide, in February 2017 Davine, breaking her silence for the first time since the ordeal, revealed how she outsmarted the hobby farmer to alert authorities and save her life. She said she used discarded hooks in the pig shed where she was being held captive to break free from the chains. Bristow took her phone but left her luggage holding her laptop in the shed with her. She freed herself from the chains and managed to send distress signals to family and friends, as well as South Australia police. Davine didn't know her exact location but was able to tell police she was picked up by a man in a red ute at Murray Bridge. From there, police were able to track her location. Davine said she was initially surprised her plan worked but knew she had to be calculated in her next move. Gene Charles Bristow lured a 24-year-old backpacker to his hobby farm in Meningie under false pretenses in February 2017 The images were shown to the court before Bristow was found guilty of six charges, including aggravated kidnapping, indecent assault and rape (pictured is the couch) So instead of attempting a daring escape, she chained herself back up so as to not alert her captor and trusted that authorities would come to her rescue. Bristow released Davine the following day after police swarmed the area in search of the missing backpacker. He was found guilty by a jury in March of one count of aggravated kidnapping, two counts of rape, two counts of indecent ­assault, and one count of attempted rape. Davine previously told the court she was certain she would die. 'I was feeling terrible and I would think about my family a lot. I thought I wouldn't see them again. (I thought) I was going to die there,' she said. Bristow (pictured left) had taken her phone, but left her luggage holding her laptop in the shed with her Further evidence, which was not included in the trial, revealed the farmer had conducted internet searches for Rohypnol, commonly known as a date-rape drug, and Tasers just four weeks before he abducted Davina. He also reportedly searched on eBay for handcuffs, shackles, and a toy gun in the weeks prior to the assault. Authorities never found drugs or Tasers but prosecutors argued the searches proved the attack was premeditated. The full interview will air on Channel 9 on Sunday night at 7pm Bristow used a toy gun (pictured) to contain the backpacker while he shackled her to the bed in the run down pig shed on his family's farm Davina was seen weeping when evidence, including the ties she was shackled with, were tendered to the court (pictured are chains used to detain the woman in the shed) The horrific scene where a Belgian backpacker was held captive with shackles and raped by a farmer who lured her with the promise of work (pictured) Bristow, 54, had lured the young woman to the property (pictured) with the promise of farm work when he kidnapped her and kept her captive before raping her repeatedly<|im_end|>

# Students miss gaokao after being stuck in hotel elevator for 40 minutes, say that their lives are ruined

ix students in Shandong province say that their young lives have been “ruined” after missing part of China’s all-important university entrance exam because they were trapped in a hotel elevator. The students were trapped inside the elevator in the city of Jining for 40 minutes, between 2:15 pm to 2:55 pm on Saturday afternoon. One of the students told reporters that they had pleaded with a hotel worker to call the police for help but that the worker had replied that the situation would be resolved in five minutes.  As five minutes became 10 and then 15, the students became increasingly anxious. In order to be admitted into the English portion of the gaokao, they had to arrive at the testing center by 2:45 pm. Finally, workers did end up calling the police and the boys were rescued just two minutes after their arrival. However, by that time, it was already too late.  With tears in their eyes, the students told local reporters that their lives had been “ruined” because of the mishap. For many teens in China, the annual gaokao is the most important moment of their young lives. The test plays a defining role in determining their future by being the deciding factor in where they will end up going to university.  The hotel has offered to pay the parents of each student 5,000 yuan ($722) in compensation. However, the parents are not satisfied with the offer. “The future of these kids has been affected. They have been studying hard for all these years,” one parent told reporters. “We demanded an explanation from the hotel but the representative didn’t show up.”  Local officials have said that they will investigate the incident and help the students to retake the English portion of the exam.<|im_end|>

# Aspirus one step closer to building downtown clinic as part of YMCA expansion

WAUSAU - People looking for more medical services on the east side of Wausau are one step closer to having a new clinic downtown. The Wausau City Council unanimously approved a development agreement Tuesday night that allows the downtown Aspirus clinic to move forward. Mary Thao was the only council member not present, as she did not attend the prior closed session meeting on the Aspirus agreement and did not stay for the vote afterward. The new clinic will be around 36,000 square feet and will require permanent road closures, including sections of McIndoe Street and North Second Street, council members said Tuesday. In the proposal from Aspirus, Second Street would become additional parking and McIndoe Street would be a drive-up, covered drop-off spot for patients at the clinic, Lindman said. The city is not providing any funding or incentives for the project, according to Director of Public Works Eric Lindman. However, the city plans to pay to reroute State Highway 52 and Business 51, which the council will consider funding for at a later date. A map provided by the city engineering department shows reroutes on Scott and Fifth streets downtown. Aspirus has not given the city any timelines for beginning construction. The city is waiting on Aspirus to complete its clinic design, Lindman said. The agreement approved Tuesday shows that the city plans to change the TID, or tax incremental district, to include the new clinic within a specific tax revenue area. Lindman said the boundary changes haven't happened yet but if approved, it would make it so that the taxes from the clinic project will go into the tax district the city moves the project into. The property that Aspirus will buy to build the clinic is between McIndoe and Fulton streets on the east-west side and Second and Third streets on the north-south side,about a block from the Cloverbelt Credit Union downtown near the Riverlife project. An August news release announcing the YMCA expansion and new Aspirus facility said the clinic would cost about $20 million to build. The Aspirus clinic component of the YMCA expansion was already fully funded, according to the same release. The Aspirus clinic will be connected to the new YMCA by a skywalk. It will provide primary and walk-in care, imaging and laboratory services, according to the news release. The design has not yet been finalized. Council member Tom Neal said he was close to opposing the agreement, because it doesn't include any dollar amounts for tax revenue the city can expect. His worry: that Aspirus could soon switch the clinic to a hospital, which would make it tax-exempt and the city would lose out on that income. Aspirus representatives said Tuesday night that such a change wouldn't happen and they intended to build a taxable project. Council President Lisa Rasmussen said the city should celebrate the approval it's been waiting for, as the development will bring more workers and vibrancy to downtown Wausau. It also creates more medical services on the city's east side, as many are now concentrated on the west side of town, she said.<|im_end|>

# Steph Curry’s Mother Sonya Curry Was Ruthlessly Heckled By Toronto Raptors Fans

Canada’s reputation for being friendly and cordial is taking a major hit this week, and it seems the NBA Finals is to blame. The Toronto Raptors are one game away from winning it all for the first time in franchise history, but being this close to a ring is bringing out the worst in the country’s basketball fans.  After Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant re-injured his achilles in Game 5 of the NBA Finals on Monday (June 10), fans were heard cheering his misfortune and were subsequently dragged on social media for it. Now, though, classlessness has gone to a whole another level.  Sonya Curry, the mother of Warriors point guard Stephen Curry, encountered some angry Toronto Raptors fans outside of her hotel on Sunday night. Video shows Mrs. Curry walking from her vehicle to the hotel with fans booing at her and at least one yelling “F**k you!” Sonya then walks over to confront the men with some pretty impressive courage.         View this post on Instagram     #SonyaCurry – mother of #GoldenState Warriors champion #StephCurry – was recently on the receiving end of some negative remarks, as she encountered some angry Toronto Raptors fans outside of her hotel on Sunday night (6/9/19). Men can be heard repeatedly screaming at Sonya: “F*ck you!” See the full story on #theJasmineBRAND.com  The Golden State Warriors – the team on which Steph plays – ended up winning just 24 hours later, 106-105 over the Raptors to force Game 6. The two teams will clash on Thursday as Toronto remains ahead in the series 3-2. Hopefully fans on both sides will keep it classy for the rest of the series.

# ICC World Cup 2019: Bhojpuri Song 'Jila Top Lagelu' Gets The British Jamming On London Streets

With the ICC World Cup 2019 in full stride, not only are Virat Kohli and the Men in Blue winning games with their brilliant display of bowling and batting attacks but the Indian culture is also taking over the streets of England and Wales at the speed of light.  Just after the match against Aaron Finch's Team Australia on Sunday, the video of a British man, Agnus Denoon, selling Kolkata's special 'Jhal Muri' in front of The Oval stadium in London surfaced and was loved by the people from all over the nation and the world.  And now, yet another video has surfaced that shows hundreds of Englishmen dancing to the tune of the extremely popular and timeless Bhojpuri folk song, 'Jila Top Lagelu' during the match between the two titans at the Oval last weekend.  This only goes on to show how much of an influence the Indian culture has become over the past few years.

# Two men facing gun, interference charges after Davenport shots fired incident

A shots fired incident late Wednesday afternoon lead to the arrest of two Davenport felons on gun and interference charges. Tray E. Miller, 23, faces charges of possession of a firearm by a felon and interference with a weapon. Each charge is a Class D felony punishable by up to five years in prison. Shawn P. Housby, 20, faces charges of possession of a firearm by a felon and interference with official acts, a simple misdemeanor. Bond was set at $5,000 cash-only. Both men have a preliminary hearing June 21. At 4:50 p.m. Wednesday, Davenport police responded to the 1000 block of Grand Avenue for a report of shots fired. Officers found several shell casings at Grand Avenue and Riverview Place. No damage or injuries were reported. During the canvass, officers developed information that lead them to an apartment at 7 Riverview Place, where the men live. Officers commanded them to come out, but they did not, according to an affidavits filed in Scott County District Court. Officers could see Miller through the window with two different pistols. After about 15 minutes of negotiator commands, the men came out and were taken into custody. A search of Miller’s apartment turned up a Silver Smith and Wesson .357-caliber Magnum revolver with the serial number filed off and a 9mm Hi Point handgun loaded with the silver and brass casings located at the scene. Miller has drug and gun convictions in Iowa and is prohibited from owning or possessing a weapon. In Housby’s apartment, officers found a loaded 12-gauge pump action shotgun hidden under a mattress, and 5 12-gauge Winchester shotgun shells, once chambered. Housby admitted to having the gun about a week before while in a neighbor’s apartment. He was adjudicated delinquent for third-degree sex abuse in 2012 and is prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm. Housby also is wanted on an interstate detainer out of Rock Island County.<|im_end|>

# Joe Biden Is Catching Up To His Party's Shifting Views On Abortion

The Democratic Party is edging more solidly leftward in its attitude toward abortion. In recent days, so has Joe Biden. Last week, the 2020 hopeful announced that he’d changed his mind on the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds for most abortions in the U.S. Up until then, Biden — who voted for the legislation in 1976 — was the only Democratic presidential candidate to still offer his support. He insisted the move wasn’t driven by political expediency, citing a spate of restrictive new state laws governing abortion. “I can’t justify leaving millions of women without the health care they need,” he said. “If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support [the amendment].” Biden isn’t the only Democrat who has shifted views on both the Hyde Amendment and abortion more broadly ― a shift that could potentially be amplified by the latest restrictions on abortion access. As recently as the summer of 2016, Democrats were close to evenly split on the Hyde Amendment, with 41% supporting the legislation and 44% opposing it. Now, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, support within the party has fallen to just 31%, with opposition rising to 55%. (Among the general public, support for the Hyde Amendment has remained relatively stable, moving from 55% to 51%.) A growing majority of Democrats also say they would support their state providing funding for women to receive abortions that are neither medically necessary nor a result of incest or rape. And Democrats are 14 points likelier now than they were three years ago to say they’d strongly support their state’s doing so. The debate over the Hyde Amendment won’t necessarily leave a defining mark on the Democratic primary. Only a quarter of Democrats say they have heard a lot about the Hyde Amendment in the news recently, and only about a third say it would be very important to their votes. With the entire 2020 Democratic field now in agreement, it’s unlikely that the legislation will continue to receive as much attention through the remaining months of the campaign cycle. Democrats remain far from unified on the broader issue of abortion, and there’s still significant wariness among some blocs, including those characterized by The New York Times as ”less educated, more moderate, more religious, more rural, more likely to be nonwhite and to live in the South.” But there’s also a rising trend in support for abortion rights within the party. Last year, according to the General Social Survey, 62% of Democrats said that it should be possible for a woman to obtain a legal abortion if she wanted one for any reason ― a 10-point rise in just two years. And a record number of party members now describe themselves as pro-choice. The recent crop of anti-abortion laws, many restrictive enough to be unpopular even among some abortion opponents, may help unify Democrats further as well as raise — at least for the moment — the prominence of reproductive rights issues. Americans are more likely to say they had heard a lot of recent news about state abortion bans than they are to report similar attention to other issues, such as investigations into President Donald Trump, debates over Trump’s impeachment, the 2020 primary, and rising tensions with Iran, according to a new report produced by the Democratic polling group Navigator Research. That may be especially true for Democratic women. Although there’s generally not much of a gender gap in views about abortion, recent polling suggests that it holds more resonance for women in the party. In another HuffPost/YouGov poll, female Democrats were more than 20 points likelier than male Democrats to say the issue of abortion would be very important to their presidential votes. And a recent Monmouth survey of Nevada showed that 22% of female Democratic voters mentioned reproductive rights or related issues as among the most important to their vote, ranking it second only to health care. Only 6% of their male counterparts brought it up.

# President Of The Rhode Island Hells Angels Chapter Arrested

President Of The Rhode Island Hells Angels Chapter Arrested  The president of the Hells Angels Rhode Island chapter was arrested on felony assault charges Wednesday, according to a statement from Rhode Island State Police.  Joseph M. Lancia, 28, was arrested in connection with an investigation into reports of shots fired near the Hells Angels Motorcycle Clubhouse. Police searched the building following his arrest, the statement read. The investigation is ongoing, and Lancia is expected to have an arraignment hearing Thursday. He may face additional charges, the statement read.  Hells Angels is one of the biggest biker clubs with 466 chapters spanning five continents, according to their website. They have a history of violence, and were recently banned from the Netherlands because of such activity, according to BBC. (RELATED: Motorcycle Riding Veterans Love America. Here’s Why)  The city of Utrecht court ruled in May that “the violence is often so serious and causes so much social unrest that it can be considered in contravention of social order,” BBC reported.  The biker club was originally founded in California, and members typically ride Harley-Davidson bikes. They have faced allegations of drug dealing, gunrunning, extortion and more.

# Julian Castro admits Hatch Act 'mistake,' calls for Kellyanne Conway's termination, in Fox News Town Hall

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro told Fox News on Thursday night White House adviser Kellyanne Conway should be fired for violating the Hatch Act — the same federal law that Castro himself was found to have violated in 2016.  The 2020 White House contender’s remarks came in a Fox News Town Hall in Tempe, Ariz., hosted by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. Separately, the Democrat tried to defend the Hillary Clinton campaign’s decision to fund an opposition research dossier written by a British ex-spy, even as he condemned President Trump for saying this week that he would be open to opposition research from foreign actors.  Castro, who served in the Obama administration, qualified on Thursday to participate in the Democrats’ first presidential primary debate, along with more than a dozen other candidates.  But, the day also brought an unwelcome spotlight on Castro’s past. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) recommended Thursday that Conway violated the Hatch Act on “numerous occasions,” and concluded that she should be removed from federal service.  The Hatch Act is a federal law that limits the political activities of certain federal employees. In 2016, “OSC concluded that Secretary Castro violated the Hatch Act by advocating for and against Presidential candidates,” the watchdog wrote in a letter to Obama. “Secretary Castro’s statements during [a televised] interview impermissibly mixed his personal political views with official agency business despite his efforts to clarify that some answers were being given in his personal capacity.”  The Obama White House took no action. Castro, pressed by Baier, argued that his case was different from Conway’s.  “Instead of saying, ‘Look, I’m going to take these efforts to make sure that doesn’t happen again,'” Castro said, “she said, ‘To hell with that, I’m going to do it.'”  Castro added that Conway’s lack of remorse was disqualifying: “Because she repeatedly violated it, even though she was told it was a violation, she should be removed from office.”  Baier and MacCallum also pushed for Castro to explain his condemnation of Trump’s recent statement that he would accept foreign political opposition research if offered. In 2017, Brian Fallon, a former Clinton campaign spokesperson, told The Washington Post that foreign-generated opposition research was a normal part of the political process.  “The first I learned of Christopher Steele or saw any dossier was after the election,” Fallon said. “But if I had gotten handed it last fall, I would have had no problem passing it along and urging reporters to look into it. Opposition research happens on every campaign, and here you had probably the most shadowy guy ever running for president, and the FBI certainly has seen fit to look into it. I probably would have volunteered to go to Europe myself to try and verify if it would have helped get more of this out there before the election.”  Republicans have pressed for answers on the Hillary Clinton campaign and DNC’s role in the creation of the infamous Steele dossier, written by British ex-spy Christopher Steele. The Clinton campaign and DNC, through the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, funded the dossier’s creation by the foreign national.  A key source for Steele was an ex-Russian intelligence officer, according to notes obtained by The Hill and written by Justice Department official Bruce Ohr. “Much of the collection about the Trump campaign ties to Russia comes from a former Russian intelligence officer (? not entirely clear) who lives in the U.S.,” Ohr wrote.  The FBI went on to cite the dossier to obtain a secret surveillance warrant to monitor former Trump aide Carter Page. Numerous problems with the Steele dossier’s reliability have surfaced, including several issues that were brought to the FBI’s attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals.  “Democrats and even some Republicans are criticziing the preisdent for saying he would listen to opposition research from a foreign government if it was offered,” MacCallum said, “but one of the questions from the other side that comes up, is how is that really different from the Democrats funding the Steele dossier in 2016 through a British operative that they knew had Russian sources?”  Castro deflected: “Well, first of all, I don’t think we should distract our situation from the fact that he have an unprecedented situation here, of a president of the United States, who if I remember the video correctly, was actually sitting in the Oval Office bbehind his desk saying that he would take intelligence against his political opponent from a foreign government.”  Pressed on Fallon’s remarks about the Clinton team’s funding of the Steele dossier, Castro asserted that the situations were simply “completely different,” without explaining.  “I think it’s safe to say we have never seen that moment in American history, and I don’t think that’s a good thing,” Castro said, referring to Trump’s comments. “I don’t understand why, on this network and in many conservative circles, people are still talking about Hillary Clinton.”  Toward the end of the town hall, even as he expressed his opposition to the Hyde Amendment that bans federal funding for abortion, Castro pointedly refused to condemn Biden’s recent flip-flop on the issue.  “We’re not on the debate stage,” Castro, considered a potential vice presidential pick, responded. “The fact is, I need to introduce myself to a lot of people who don’t know who I am yet.”  Immigration also featured prominently early in the town hall, with Castro saying the issue was “personal” to him — and that Obama, his former boss, had demonstrated real “compassion on the issue.”  “I think the crisis that exists is driven by conditions in countries like Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala,” Castro said. “I believe we have a crisis of leadership.”  Fox News’ Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum contributed to this report.<|im_end|>

# Inmates to Entrepreneurs graduates 2nd Wilmington class

Program helps former offenders become business-owners after release  WILMINGTON -- After Lacy Tate was released from federal prison last year, he hit roadblock after roadblock on his path back to normal life. Tate, 50, had served about 13 years of a 20-year sentence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and heroin. Despite getting his N.C. Peer Support Specialist certification while behind bars -- a program in which people recovering from mental illness or substance abuse are trained to help others -- Tate struggled to get a foothold in Wilmington. After living in a halfway house, he had trouble getting subsidized housing through the Wilmington Housing Authority, where he remains on the waitlist. When he applied to get food stamps, he was turned away due to his felony drug conviction. Accessing his disability checks brought another mountain of paperwork. "After 13 years, both of my parents passed, so I came out without anything," Tate said. "I was wrong for what I did -- I sold drugs -- but I'm trying to get to start over." Eventually, he found helping hands. Tate enrolled in a vocational rehab program, and found a psychologist at MedNorth Health Center. Wilmington non-profit Leading Into New Communities, Inc. (LINC, Inc.), which has a council for former prisoners reentering society in New Hanover County, connected him with resources. Finally, there was Inmates to Entrepreneurs. Wednesday night, Inmates to Entrepreneurs graduated its second class from the Wilmington area. The organization, which opened a Wilmington office in 2018, helps North Carolinians with criminal backgrounds to start their own businesses. Growing demand Wednesday's class of 15 graduates included an aspiring handyman, painter, Christian minister, and one woman who has already launched a dessert business called Heavenly Treats. Founder Brian Hamilton said due to a growing demand in the Wilmington area, the organization plans to add a second class this year. Each year, more than 22,000 men and women are released from North Carolina's prison system, according to the Department of Public Safety. But Hamilton said anyone who's been charged with a crime can face stigma and difficulties finding gainful employment. "We don’t just serve people in prison, but we also serve people who have been judicially involved," he said. "They have this record on the Internet. Even if they haven’t gone to prison, they still have the mugshot, and that’s really a big obstacle for them." Hamilton also praised Cape Fear Community College's Small Business Center -- and its director, Jerry Coleman -- for housing Inmates to Entrepreneurs this year. "There's a high need in Wilmington, and we obviously look forward to continuing," he said. Moving forward Among the graduates Wednesday was Tate, who after completing the 4-week course is opening a trucking business: Moving it Forward. Inmates to Entrepreneurs helped him incorporate with the state, get an Employer Identification Number (EIN), and set up a domain with an email address. It also connected him with Self-Help Credit Union, where he's started an account to build up his credit after a credit card rejection from Bank of America. After graduation, he'll be connected with a local mentor. The only thing he's waiting on is for his son, Ah'God Lacy Tate, 22, to be released from prison in October. The younger Tate, in jail since age 17 on convictions for assault with a deadly weapon and attempted robbery, took a commercial driver's license course while in prison. Tate's dream is to give his son employment that keeps him from re-offending. "I don’t want him back out in these streets," he said. "When I talk to (my other son), when he tells me, 'Dad, I don’t see nothing,' it's dark. It's real, real sad. And it's not just him, it's almost all the youth that I encounter out here." Tate said he recommends Inmates to Entrepreneurs to anyone feeling directionless after release from prison. "I thank God so, so much to have another opportunity," he said. "I truly, truly thank God."

# WATCH: Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaks about leaving the White House

Sarah Huckabee Sanders is leaving the White House, where she has spent more than two years as the president’s press secretary and one of his closest aides. After President Donald Trump announced her departure on Twitter, he gave her the podium at an event on inmates returning to the workforce. Sanders called her time as Trump’s chief spokesperson “the honor of a lifetime” and said she will “continue to be one of the most outspoken and loyal supporters of the president and his agenda.”  Sanders will leave at the end of June to return to her home state of Arkansas. Her father, Mike Huckabee, is a former governor of the state — and Trump said Thursday he hoped she’d run for the job, too.  Sanders took over as press secretary in 2017, after the resignation of Sean Spicer. Before that, she worked on the White House communications staff and as a key member of Trump’s 2016 campaign.  Her full comments are below.  Thank you. Thank you so much. I’ll try not to get emotional because I know that crying can make us look weak sometimes right?  This has been the honor of a lifetime, the opportunity of a lifetime. I couldn’t be prouder to have had the opportunity to serve my country and particularly to work for this president. He has accomplished so much in these two and a half years, and it’s truly been something I will treasure forever. It’s one of the greatest jobs I could ever have. I’ve loved every minute even the hard minutes I have loved it. I love the president. I love the team that I’ve had the opportunity to work for. The president is surrounded by some of the most incredible and most talented people you could ever imagine. And it’s truly the most special experience.  The only one I can think of that might top it just a little bit is the fact that I’m a mom. I have three amazing kids, and I’m going to spend a little more time with them. And in the meantime, I’m going to continue to be one of the most outspoken and loyal supporters of the president and his agenda. And I know he’s going to have an incredible six more years and get a whole lot more done like what we’re here to celebrate today. And I don’t want to take away from that, so I certainly want to get back to the tremendous thing that the people behind me have done. And thank you so much Mr. President. It’s truly an honor<|im_end|>

# Colombian Radio Journalist, Peace Advocate Shot Dead

Montenegro, 42, dedicated himself to covering the region’s peace-related issues among a number of other topics.  The death of a Colombian radio journalist shook the community of Samaniego, Nariño this week after he was shot dead Tuesday night in a motorcycle drive-by, authorities said.  Radio Journalist Libardo Montenegro’s death has been ruled a homicide, the Foundation for Press Freedom (FLIP) confirmed following a briefing with Nariño municipal authorities.  Montenegro, 42, dedicated himself to covering the region’s peace-related issues, among a number of other topics. A television interview on the morning of his death revealed he was organizing a meeting for “the defense of life and human rights in Samaniego.”  He was well liked in his profession and had worked tirelessly as a journalist for some 20 years. His final tenure was with Samaniego Estereo, a member of the Community Radio Stations for Peace and Coexistence project supported by the European Union. The movement works towards the “construction of a Culture of Peace in the Territories."  President Ivan Duque wrote on Twitter, “We strongly reject the murder of Journalist Libardo Montenegro. … I have asked authorities to advance investigations and find those responsible for this crime.”  According to reports, Montenegro was near his girlfriend’s home in Samaniego when a pair of motorcyclists overtook him and shot him several times, Colonel William Peña said. Police investigators have not made any conclusions about whether the radio host was targeted for a deadly assault based on his profession or his personal projects.  However, a pattern has emerged this year, with some 15 human rights activists killed in the Department of Nariño.  FLIP condemned the deadly act, writing, “The appraisal made by the police is not only on shaky ground but contradicts the work that Montenegro carried out in the town. Although the relationship of his murder to his profession is in the process of being documented, there is not a single piece of evidence for the police to disregard his role as a journalist.  “When the authorities disregard the role of a journalist, the official figures that register and track incidences of violence against the press can be affected. The impact of that reaction – reckless – is starker in municipalities such as Samaniego, where the regional press is scarce and vulnerable,” the organization said.  Since 2017, six journalists were murdered in Colombia.<|im_end|>

# Sheriff's office warns of scam call impersonating deputy

WATERLOO – Sheriff’s deputies are warning residents about a phone scam where the con man is impersonating one of their own. The caller claims to be Sgt. Chad Hagarty, and the caller ID sometimes identifies the call as coming from the Black Hawk County Sheriff’s Office. You have free articles remaining.  The fake sergeant tells the residents that they have a civil warrant that can turn into a criminal warrant if they don’t take care of it immediately over the phone. The caller also claims there will be an arrest warrant issued if they hang up without making a payment. Deputies said residents receiving the call should tell the caller they know it’s a scam and report it to the sheriff’s office. They should avoid disclosing personal and financial information during the calls and not call the number back.<|im_end|>

# Commentary: Foreign election meddling is wrong, Mr. President

It was extraordinary to hear a U.S. president declare that the FBI director is “wrong” for saying that candidates should report to the FBI — as the law clearly intends — any effort by foreign agents to aid a political candidate by passing along opposition research. President Donald Trump does not understand the value of the law prohibiting campaigns from such aid, nor does he appear to have any intention of following it.  For all the different interpretations of the Mueller report, there is one aspect of it where there should be no debate among Republicans and Democrats: The threat of foreign meddling in U.S. elections has increased, it must not be tolerated or abetted, and campaigns must be held accountable for assisting in policing this national security imperative.  On this issue, the standard for ethical and patriotic behavior should not be whether someone engages in a criminal conspiracy. It should be whether someone acts with honor in rebuffing — and reporting — attempts at foreign influence. That did not happen in 2016, and unless Congress acts soon, we may see an even worse breach in 2020.  The National Republican Campaign Committee has refused to pledge, as its Democratic counterpart has, not to use hacked or stolen materials. And now the president has indicated that his re-election campaign would be open to using them, too. The Russians — to say nothing of the North Koreans — must be grinning ear to ear.  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, led by Dan Coats, noted two years ago that Russia’s interference in the 2016 election represented a “significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort” compared with previous attempts. Special Counsel Robert Mueller agreed, calling the Russian efforts “sweeping and systematic.”  Although a lot of this mischief took place in the digital realm of hackers and social-media trolls, a shocking amount happened face-to-face — and all the while the public was in the dark. Russian nationals or intermediaries had at least 140 contacts with key figures employed by or associated with Donald Trump’s campaign and transition teams.  Stopping campaigns from engaging in bouts of international footsie should be easy — far easier than addressing the multifaceted cyber-operations (run not only by Russia but also by China, Iran and other nations seeking to influence American politics). Congress can start by passing the Foreign Influence Reporting in Elections Act, sponsored by Senator Mark Warner of Virginia.  This sensible legislation would require campaign officials to maintain a basic compliance system to monitor election-related contacts with foreign nationals, and to report any such contacts to the Federal Election Commission. Elected office-holders and staff who meet with foreigners in an official capacity would be exempt.  Campaigns would need to alert the FEC within one week of receiving any offer of information, services or donations from a foreign national, and provide a summary description of who was involved and what was proposed. The FEC would then notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Anyone who knowingly violates the law would be subject to fines and imprisonment. That should limit the kind of misdirection employed by the Trump team in 2016, when high-ranking campaign figures, including the candidate himself, repeatedly denied any contacts with Russians.  By now it is abundantly clear that the public cannot simply trust campaign officials to act as honorably as Al Gore’s campaign did in 2000, when it came into possession of a Bush campaign briefing book and other materials and turned them over to the FBI. We should expect that kind of principled behavior. But we should not pretend every campaign is capable of it without legal compulsion.  This legislation alone is not enough to end foreign attempts at election interference. The vulnerabilities of U.S. infrastructure are too great and the potential rewards of manipulation, too enticing. But by making explicit what is out of bounds for American political campaigns, and reinforcing the rules with serious penalties, the proposed law should shore up at least one political norm, and perhaps some small measure of public confidence, damaged in the 2016 election.  Still, the larger problem remains: the absence in the Oval Office of an understanding that patriotism requires ethical actions that transcend one’s own fortunes.  Michael R.

# Update On Ethanol And Archer-Daniels-Midland

In the United States, the ethanol mandate requires a blend of gasoline and the biofuel to power automobiles. Last century, the introduction of the blend served three purposes. First, it lowered US dependence on imported oil from the Middle East, which was likely the primary reason for the regulation. Second, environmentalists consider ethanol cleaner fuel when it comes to emissions. Finally, another demand vertical for corn supports US farmers who are the leading producers and exporters of the grain in the world. Recently, the Trump administration lifted a ban on E15, a 15% ethanol blend, which is 5% higher than the standard mandate. With US farmers facing the economic hardship of tariffs on China, and record crude oil production in the United States, the ethanol mandate in 2019 provides a backdoor subsidy for farmers as environmental concerns have taken a backseat, and the US is no longer dependent on Middle Eastern crude oil.  Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) is a diversified agricultural processing company that is active in processing corn into the biofuel. Some of ADM's earnings depend on the margin of processing the gain into the fuel. Just because the price of ethanol has moved significantly higher since late 2019 does not translate into profits, because it is the relationship between the price of the input, corn, and the value of the output, ethanol, that determines if ADM's profits rise or fall.  A low in late 2018  Source: CQG  As the quarterly chart highlights, the price had never traded below $1.25 per gallon, but last year it fell below the $1.20 level.  Ethanol prices declined during a time that was almost a perfect bearish storm for the biofuel. The price of crude oil was falling from a high at $76.90 on October 1 to a low at $49.41 during the week of November 26 on its way to a bottom at $42.36 in late December. Additionally, the price of nearby corn futures traded to a low at $3.5525 per bushel during the final week of November which also put pressure on the price of the ethanol futures and sent them to what turned out to be a significant bottom at $1.1980 per gallon.  Higher lows and higher highs lead to a break to the upside  The price of ethanol ignored the action in the oil and stock market last December, and the price began to recover. It turned out that ethanol at under $1.20 per gallon was an unsustainable level for the biofuel futures.  Source: CQG  As the weekly chart illustrates, ethanol began to make higher lows and higher highs in December 2018, which set the stage for the significant rally that occurred in May. The level of technical resistance that ended the pattern of lower highs and lower lows in the ethanol futures market stood at the high from the week of August 6, 2018, at $1.49 per gallon. During the week of May 28, 2019, the price rose to a peak at $1.525, which was only one penny shy of the 2018 peak at $1.535 from mid-March 2018. After reaching a record low, the ethanol futures market turned around and ended the bearish price pattern that had been in place since December 2016. On Thursday, June 13, the price of nearby ethanol futures was trading around the $1.544 per gallon level, which was the highest price since September 2017.  Meanwhile, the prices of crude oil and gasoline have weakened while ethanol went the other way.  Crude oil has stabilized, for now  Source: CQG  Source: CQG  Meanwhile, NYMEX gasoline futures fell from $2.1559 per gallon during the same week, to $1.7175 on June 13, or 20.3% over the same period. However, ethanol futures rose to a new high on June 13.  Corn recovered which lit a fire under the biofuel  While the price of ethanol is sensitive to oil and gasoline prices, corn is the ingredient in its production, so the price of the grain is the most significant factor when it comes to the path of least resistance for the price of the biofuel.  Source: CQG  The chart shows that the price of corn futures blasted higher since mid-May. Even though agricultural commodities are in the crosshairs of the trade dispute between the US and China, a higher force was responsible for the rise in the price of corn. Each year is always a new adventure when it comes to the production of agricultural commodities, and it is the weather conditions across the fertile plains of the United States and growing areas around the world that determine price direction. Floods across critical growing regions in the US delayed planting, which led to the sharp rally and recovery in the corn futures market since May. As the weekly chart shows, nearby CBOT corn futures moved from a low at $3.3550 to a high at $4.4275 per bushel since mid-May, a rise of 32% over the period. The bottom line is that corn has taken the price of ethanol higher because of concerns that the late planting of 2019 could lead to lower yields during the fall harvest season. Ethanol processors are now paying a lot more for the primary ingredient in the biofuel, which is forcing the price of ethanol futures higher.  How has ethanol's price rise impacted ADM shares?  Since November, the price of ethanol moved from $1.198 to $1.556 per gallon, a rise of 30%. Meanwhile, corn rose from $3.5525 to $4.4275 or 24.6% over the same period. The higher percentage move in the price of the biofuel tells us that refiners are earning increased profits processing the grain into ethanol. However, the recent price spike in the corn market since May came as a surprise and could be problematic for companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland if it did not load up on corn at much lower prices. Since the week of May 13, the price of corn exploded by 32%, while ethanol's price moved from $1.276 to $1.556 per gallon or 21.9%. Timing is everything in markets, and the price action in ADM shares could be telling that the latest move in corn compared to ethanol has not been helpful for the company's bottom line.  Source: Barchart  ADM shares hit a low at $39.16 in late December when the stock market, crude oil, ethanol, and corn were under pressure. The prices of all four have moved significantly higher as of June 13, but ADM shares were at $41 per share, just 4.7% higher. The price action in ADM shares is telling that while ethanol prices have moved higher, the company has not experienced an increase in earnings from its ethanol refining business. While the prices of corn and other grains have increased because of delayed planting, the threat of less volume for the company in 2019 is weighing on its share price. The bottom line is that ADM is not participating in the corn and ethanol rallies, which could be weighing on the company's earnings.  ADM is a company that is a supermarket to the world. The diversified agricultural company has many business verticals. ADM has a market cap of $22.967 billion and trades over 3.6 million shares each day. The company pays shareholders a dividend of 3.65%. ADM is a company that will continue to thrive, but the price action in markets and in the company's shares could mean that it will test lower levels in the coming weeks and perhaps months.  Source: Barchart  The long-term chart shows that ADM probed below its first level of technical support at the November 2017 low at $38.59 per share when it reached $37.77 in late May. The next level of support stands at the January 2016 bottom at $29.86 per share. At $41 on June 13, a correction in the stock could lead to a buying opportunity. I would be a scale-down buyer of ADM shares or a seller of put options during a correction where a rise in the VIX causes option premium to expand at below the $40 per share level.  The price action in the ethanol refining spread and potential problems for 2019 crops could weigh on ADM's earnings. I would view a correction as an opportunity as I expect the early 2016 low at just under the $30 per share level to hold.

# Shirley Defends His Crown in Hell Tour Opener

KANKAKEE, IL — June 13, 2019 — Defending DIRTcar Summer Nationals Champion Brian Shirley kicked off this year’s Hell Tour in true champ fashion, leading all but the first lap of the Feature to score his 20th all-time Summer Nationals win and first-ever win at Kankakee County Speedway.    With his $5,000 check secured, the Chatham, IL driver commended the track for making it easy on him. “It’s got that old characteristic of dirt that makes things better,” he said. “It’s a little easier on the equipment.”    After qualifying third in his flight and winning his Heat to line up second in the Feature, Shirley stole the lead from Frank Heckenast Jr on lap two of the tour opener and went on to lead the remaining 38 laps. Meanwhile, Heckenast fell back to third but regained second on a lap 18 restart — car trouble for Shannon Babbs — leaving Fast Qualifier Rusty Schlenk to settle for third. The McClure, OH driver started the night with a 14.110-second lap around the quarter-mile.    Completing the top five were Jason Feger and Ryan Unzicker, claiming the Hard Charger Award after having advanced thirteen positions.    Babb drew two cautions during the 40-lap feature — on lap six and lap 18 — due to electrical issues, and was forced to leave the field after the second. “The gauges went out, and I had no power,” he said. While the crew was still working to find the issue on the 18 car, they were yet determined to continue the tour to Sycamore Speedway as planned.    The intensity was high at Kankakee County Speedway after rain claimed the original kickoff at Peoria Speedway the night prior — and despite the previous year’s champion taking the prize, the night was not without its surprises as several strong contenders — Babb, Dennis Erb Jr, and last weekend’s Dirt Late Model Dream winner Brandon Sheppard— experienced unrecoverable setbacks. Twenty-nine DIRTcar Late Models checked in with 38 UMP Modifieds.    The DIRTcar Summer Nationals advances to the Sycamore Speedway in Maple Park, IL on Friday June 14th, 2019.

# Raptors dethrone Warriors to capture first NBA crown

The Toronto Raptors captured their first NBA crown on Thursday, defeating Golden State 114-110 to become the first league champion from outside the United States by dethroning the defending titleholders. Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam each scored 26 points while Kawhi Leonard and reserve Fred VanVleet each added 22 as Toronto won the best-of-seven series four games to two. Leonard was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player for the second time in his career after the first in 2014 with San Antonio, which traded him to Toronto last July. “Last summer I was going through a lot. I just kept working hard and had my mind set on this goal right here,” Leonard said. “This is why I play basketball. This is what I work hard for. I’m glad to see it all pay off.” 
 The Raptors became the first Canadian club to win a major North American sports title since the 1993 Toronto Blue Jays captured Major League Baseball’s World Series. Klay Thompson scored 30 points to lead the Warriors but left the game with a left knee injury late in the third quarter after landing awkwardly on his left leg. Injury-hit Golden State was already without two-time NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Kevin Durant, who returned in game five Monday after being sidelined for a month only to suffer a ruptured right Achilles tendon. Andre Iguodala added 22 points for the Warriors, Stephen Curry had 21 and Draymond Green contributed 11 points, 18 rebounds, and 13 assists. “Everybody on this team played with a lot of heart,” Green said. “We just came up a little short.” Golden State had a final shot to win trailing 111-110 but Curry missed a 3-pointer and Green called a timeout when the team had none, setting up three final free throws by Leonard to seal the victory. Leonard was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player for the second time in his career after the first in 2014 with San Antonio. The Raptors spoiled the Warriors’ farewell appearance at Oracle Arena. Golden State’s home since 1971 will be replaced by a new $1 billion venue in San Francisco next season. Toronto’s triumph made this first NBA Finals where road teams won five consecutive games. Lowry scored 21 points in the first half to give Toronto a 60-57 lead, hitting 7-of-10 shots from the floor and 4-of-5 from 3-point range. Thompson led the Warriors with 18 first-half points.

# Trump on ‘Fox & Friends’: I will not fire Kellyanne Conway after watchdog rebuke

President Trump, in an exclusive interview Friday morning with “Fox & Friends,” said he will not fire adviser Kellyanne Conway in the wake of a government watchdog’s recommendation that she be removed over violations of the Hatch Act. “I’m not gonna fire her. I think she’s a terrific person. She’s a tremendous spokesperson,” Trump said. The Hatch Act limits certain political activities of federal employees. In an explosive report released a day earlier, the Office of Special Counsel (which is separate from the office with a similar name previously run by Robert Mueller) cited Conway for repeatedly violating the law with political statements about Democratic presidential candidates in media interviews and on Twitter. Trump, though, said: “It looks to me like they’re trying to take away her right of free speech.” He even suggested he would not counsel Conway to tone it down. “It doesn’t work that way,” Trump said, arguing that Conway was merely responding to political attacks against him. “A person wouldn’t be able to express themselves, and I just don’t see it.” Trump noted that he will be getting a briefing on the findings. Special Counsel Henry Kerner, meanwhile, defended his office’s work in an interview with Fox News on Thursday. Still, he was deferential to Trump, making clear the decision on whether to remove Conway is his alone. “We respect his decision and, of course, the president has any option he’d like—to reprimand or not to reprimand,” Kerner said. “It is up to the president’s discretion and we respect that.” In the interview, Kerner said his office had “several discussions” with the White House counsel and they had the OSC report “for weeks.” He said this was “not some sort of a drop it-on-them situation.” “I am a Trump appointee—I have no animus toward Kellyanne whatsoever,” he added. “My job is to make sure the federal workforce stay as depoliticized and as fair as possible.” The White House on Thursday had slammed the report as “unprecedented” and suggested it was politically influenced. Kerner, though, said not offering recommendations for disciplinary action was “a bad signal to federal workers.” The OSC report itself stated that in one Feb. 19 interview on "Fox & Friends," Conway “insinuated that Senator Booker was ‘sexist’ and a ‘tinny’ ‘motivational speaker,’” and claimed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was “'lying'” about her ethnicity. Conway also “attacked” former Rep. Beto O’Rourke for not “thinking the women running are good enough to be President.” In its conclusion, the OSC said that Conway “has substantial knowledge of the Hatch Act and was previously found to have violated the law by engaging in similar conduct.”<|im_end|>

# Queen's cousin the Duke of Kent, 83, involved in 60mph road smash months after Prince Philip rolled Land Rover at Sandringham

THE Duke of Kent was involved in a 60mph car crash with a 21-year-old student - just months after Prince Philip rolled his Land Rover.  Prince Edward, 83, the Queen's cousin, was driving a Jaguar when he allegedly pulled out in front of Olivia Fellows' Mini on the A27 near Brighton.  Miss Fellows, from Hastings in East Sussex, said she was left "badly shaken" following the collision at 8.30pm on June 2.  Police inquiries are ongoing. The 21-year-old, who is studying neuroscience at the University of Sussex, said she had not had any contact from either the Duke or the palace after the crash.  Her Mini was written off in the smash.  She told the Daily Mail Online: "I was driving north at 60mph and suddenly this Jaguar pulled out in front of me.  "I saw the Jag to my left and it looked like he was going to go, then hesitated and changed his mind and went to go again. "He shot across the road. But it was so close that if I hadn't emergency braked I would have gone straight into the middle of his car.  "As I put on the brakes, my car span towards the central reservation and smashed into it. I clipped the curb and buckled the wheel arch of my car.  "The airbags went off and there was smoke coming from the engine."  A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said: "A royal household vehicle was indirectly involved in a collision on June 2 in Sussex.  "All the relevant details have been passed to the police."  A spokesman for Sussex Police said: "Police were called to a collision on the A27 at Firle around 8.30pm on Sunday 2 June.  "A vehicle collided with the central reservation close to the junction with Lacys Hill, reportedly after avoiding colliding with another vehicle.  "No injuries were reported and enquiries are ongoing."  MOST READ IN NEWS The incident comes just five months after Prince Philip was involved in a serious car crash.  The Land Rover Freelander he was driving flipped over after being hit by another vehicle carrying two women and a baby near the Sandringham estate in January.  The duke, who was miraculously unhurt, had to be rescued through the window by a passing motorist.  Philip faced criticism for taking too long to contact the occupants of the other car and for being seen driving without his seat belt in the days that followed.  Passenger Emma Fairweather, who broke her wrist, called for Philip to be prosecuted if he was found to be at fault.  The duke later apologised for his part in the crash and voluntarily surrendered his licence, with the Crown Prosecution Service saying he would face no further action.  We pay for your stories!

# Man arrested for East London taxi driver’s murder

Police flying squad officers in Mdantsane in East London, with the assistance of community members of Nciba locality, Ngquthu village near Kei Bridge, Butterworth, have arrested a 27-year-old man in connection with the murder of a metered taxi driver on Friday, Eastern Cape police said.  It was alleged that a meter taxi owner received a call from an unknown man to pick him up at Vincent in East London just before 4am on Friday morning, Captain Jackson Manatha said.  The man apparently wanted to be driven from Vincent to Amalinda. The owner of the meter taxi phoned his driver to go and fetch the person. Later, when the driver was phoned by his girlfriend at about 6am, he did not answer his phone, he said.  The girlfriend then phoned the taxi owner, telling him that her boyfriend had not come home and was not answering his phone. The matter was reported to police and the investigation led police towards Butterworth.  ”The suspect was spotted along [the] N2 near Kei Bridge, Butterworth. When the suspect was stopped, it is alleged that he became vicious and fought with the police. Community members came to the rescue of the police and assisted in arresting the suspect [at about 8am] near Nciba locality, Ngquthu village along Kei Cuttings, Butterworth.”  The 39-year-old taxi driver’s body was found on the back seat of the car. He had been stabbed. The suspect had been charged with murder, kidnapping, and car hijacking. The motive for the murder was not known, and it was not yet clear where the taxi driver had been murdered. The 27-year-old suspect would appear in the Butterworth Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, Manatha said.  – African News Agency (ANA)<|im_end|>

# Asda is selling sausage and egg muffins that 'taste like McDonald's McMuffins'

Are you a fan of the McDonald’s McMuffin? You’ll be pleased to know that Asda is selling a very similar product at a cheaper price. Not only is it more affordable, it also allows you to enjoy the fast food favourite in the comfort of your own home. Here’s everything you need to know about the product. Asda is selling its Breakfast Muffin Sausage & Egg for a quid. The £1 breakfast item is £1.49 cheaper than McDonald’s best-selling version. And according to some shoppers, it tastes just as good as Maccies’ food. When a picture of the brekkie treat was posted to the Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK Group, it received an overwhelmingly positive response. The snap racked up 270 likes and more than 400 comments. One commenter wrote: “Warmer than maccies and taste better.” Another said: “Apparently these taste exactly the same so I have heard from a few people.” A third added: “They taste better.” Even though dozens of shoppers said they were fans of the product, some think it doesn’t compare to McDonald’s version. A fast food fan admitted: “I’ve had these a few times, they’re not the worst things I’ve tasted but they’re nowhere near as McDonald’s.” A second commented: “These are nice but no way near McDonald’s taste.” Another remarked: “Very much doubt they’re even close to McDs!”<|im_end|>

# Why HK's extradition bill fuelled protests

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has delayed indefinitely a proposed law that would allow extraditions to mainland China, in a dramatic retreat after anger over the bill sparked the biggest street protests in three decades. WHAT DOES THE EXTRADITION BILL INVOLVE? The Hong Kong government first launched the proposals in February, putting forward sweeping changes that would simplify case-by-case extraditions of criminal suspects to countries beyond the 20 which Hong Kong already has existing extradition treaties with. It explicitly allows extraditions from Hong Kong to greater China - including the mainland, Taiwan and Macau - for the first time, closing what Hong Kong government officials have repeatedly described as a "loophole" that they claim has allowed the city to become a haven for criminals from the mainland. Hong Kong's leader would start and finally approve an extradition following a request from a foreign jurisdiction but only after court hearings, including any possible appeals. However, the bill removes Legislative Council oversight of extradition arrangements. If the bill becomes law, it will be possible for mainland Chinese courts to request Hong Kong courts to freeze and confiscate assets related to crimes committed on the mainland, beyond an existing provision covering the proceeds of drug offences. HOW STRONG IS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL? Concern about the amendments has spiralled in recent weeks, taking in pro-business and pro-Beijing elements usually loath to publicly contradict the Hong Kong or Chinese governments. Senior Hong Kong judges have privately expressed alarm, and mainland commercial lawyers based in Hong Kong have echoed their fears, saying the mainland system cannot be trusted to meet even basic standards of judicial fairness. Hong Kong lawyers' groups have issued detailed submissions to the government, hoping to force a postponement. Some opposition politicians say the issue now represents a turning point for the city's free status. WILL THE GOVERNMENT DROP THE BILL? Several pro-Beijing politicians and a senior advisor to Lam said discussion of the bill should be shelved for the time being. Lam said the city's legislature would now stop all work on the bill and that the next steps would be decided after consultations with various parties.<|im_end|>

# Stockton woman dislocates her hip in Download Festival mudbath

A Stockton music lover's Download Festival trip turned into a nightmare after dislocating her hip as rain turned the site into a mudpit.  The metal festival has been dubbed Drownload after storms caused carnage.  And Samantha Gibben left after just six hours - before a note was even played - after she dislocated her hip on the ground.  The rock lover has EDS and Hypermobility which makes it especially easy to dislocate her joints.  She said: "On solid ground it isn't an issue, but on mud like that it was.  "We were there by about 3pm in the afternoon, and it was already ankle deep mud in the village.  "It felt like no preparation had been made to prevent that."  However, she says she's been "misquoted" in other media outlets after an initial private post was picked up.  "As a result of just saying my hips dislocated without the context of the fact I have EDS and Hypermobility, as you can imagine it's led to some pretty awful comments being made.  "At no point did the rain bother me. You can protect against rain. For me the issue was the mud."  However the sun eventually DID come out - just as Teesside rock legend David Coverdale took up the stage as Whitesnake played to one of the biggest crowds of the festival so far.  The Saltburn rocker, 67, wheeled out hits including 'Is This Love' and 'Here I Go Again' and 'Still Of The Night'. There were huge cheers during the hour-long set on Friday afternoon while the conditions on site have improved dramatically.  Organisers have put down more hay over the mud overnight which has also largely dried in the sun, with temperatures topping 18 degrees. And there's more sun predicted on Saturday - although the Met Office has also warned of showers.  After several other festival goers reported issues with the early mud, festival bosses tweeted: "A big thank you to all of you for keeping up the amazing Download spirit. No one is tougher than you guys."  The festival is being headlined by Tool, Slipknot and Def Leppard.<|im_end|>

# Sherif Love Island: Is this the reason why Sherif left Love Island?

Love Island 2019 took audiences on an emotional rollercoaster this week after Sherif Lanre quit the show. No specific reason was given for why he left by either ITV or Sherif – apart from a rule being broken. However, Sherif has spoken out now in a new interview. Sherif said he the reason for his exit was because he accidentally kicked Molly-Mae Hague in the groin area. He said he then used “offensive” language following the play fight with Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury. In an interview with The Sun, Sherif explained: “I did kick Molly-Mae in the groin area but it was an accident and she 100 per cent was not injured afterwards. She did appear to be in pain at first but then she stood up and seemed fine and we started laughing about it. “I turned to Tommy and said, ‘That was a c**t punt.’ I realise now that was wrong and I would like to apologise. “I’ve never used the word before and I don’t know where it came from. I think I have heard other people saying it and it just popped out. “But I realise it can be offensive and, as someone that was raised by a strong and loving mother, I want to say that I would never intentionally harm a woman.” Sherif went on to say: “I know I have been stupid and let myself down but I was not being malicious. This has been blown out of all proportion and I have been made to look like a terrible person when I am not.” A spokesperson for ITV told Express.co.uk: “Sherif fully accepted and agreed that he broke the rules and that he should leave. “We have a duty of care towards all of the Islanders and as such we would not make public the details of the breach of code.” Sherif’s interview comes after he and ITV jointly released a statement earlier this week after news of his exit broke. The statement at the time read: “After breaking the villa rules Sherif had conversations with the producers and it was mutually agreed that he would leave the Love Island villa.” “In a case of poor judgement, I broke the villa rules and as a result agreed with the producers that it was best for me to leave the villa. “I regret that I didn’t conduct myself in the right way and, as a 20-year-old guy, it’s something I know I will take on board and learn from.” Sherif concluded: “I really enjoyed my time in the villa and look forward to catching up with everyone on the outside." After leaving the villa, Sherif took to social media to reassure fans he was doing well. He was previously coupled up with Anna Vakili but she is now single since he left and in danger of being dumped from the villa. Love Island is known for constantly shaking up its contestants, so perhaps Anna could meet another man if another boy is introduced to the show. Love Island airs daily on ITV2 at 9pm<|im_end|>

# Yeo fights to be fit for Essendon as Naitanui eyes AFL return

Star West Coast on-baller Elliot Yeo will race the clock to be fit to play against Essendon in Perth on Thursday while big cult figure Nic Naitanui ponders when to make his anticipated comeback. Naitanui and West Coast coach Adam Simpson will weigh up whether to confront the Bombers or resume through WAFL ranks from an 11-month recovery from a full knee reconstruction. Yeo is battling a calf strain that is understood to be a three-to-four week injury after the reigning West Coast club champion missed a seven-goal thumping from Sydney ahead of last weekend’s bye. Yeo, 25, is tipped to miss confronting the free-wheeling Bombers. The dual Eagles club champion is pivotal in his side’s midfield operations with an average of 24 disposals an outing, along with six clearances and around seven tackles an outing this season. West Coast must also find replacements for livewire small forward Willie Rioli and premiership ruckman Nathan Vardy who will both serve one-match bans from offences against the Swans. Premiership captain Shannon Hurn is expected back from a hamstring strain that forced the All-Australian defender to miss his side’s loss to Sydney, when the Eagles back-line was cracked open by five-goal outings from Lance Franklin and Tom Papley. Naitanui, 29, will be considered as a direct replacement for Vardy. The influential Naitanui is ready for a return after missing all of the 2019 season so far with a second knee ACL injury setback inside two years. He is also on the verge of announcing a new three-year contract extension tipped to be in the region of $2.5million. Naitanui could be carefully managed with around 60 minutes across a return at the top level in tandem with first-year recruit Tom Hickey. West Coast heavy hitters are making last-minute calls on whether the preferred lead ruckman should be run straight back into the highest level or spend at least a week in the Eagles reserves team. Ironically, if Naitanui plays WAFL on Saturday it will be at East Fremantle where he played a pre-season practice game ahead of an emotion-charged AFL return in the opening round of last year after missing the entire 2017 season. Naitanui suffered his second ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in the Eagles' stirring round 17 win over eventual grand final opponent Collingwood. He has been back into full training for at least a month and dominating Eagles match simulation drills against the inconsistent Vardy and Hickey. Other Eagles replacements are expected to include exciting teenager Jarrod Cameron in a debut to fill opportunist forward-pocket duties from Rioli. Premiership utility Dan Venables is also tipped to present for recall as he recovers from a heavy concussion he copped against Melbourne in Perth a month ago.<|im_end|>

# Warriors' injuries, Lakers' acquisition makes Western Conference wide open

Toronto earned its NBA championship and wild Canada-wide celebration. Kawhi Leonard deserves an elevated platform and for more of us to wonder if he is actually the best player in the NBA right now.  In the aftermath of all of it, though, we are left to digest what Golden State’s injuries — in combination with news that the Lakers are trading for Anthony Davis — mean in the big picture of the NBA.  Kevin Durant’s torn Achilles and Klay Thompson’s torn ACL — both occurring, by the way, on the same legs that kept both players out of action in the early part of the series — are not short-term injuries. An already uncertain offseason for the Warriors became truly chaotic.  Durant might sign elsewhere … or he could opt in for one more year with Golden State that would be used almost exclusively (or completely) for rehabbing his injury. Thompson, also a free agent, could return to the Warriors. But he, too, will spend most or all of next season trying to return to health.  That leaves the NBA’s Western Conference, Golden State’s domain for the past five seasons, very much up for grabs — at least in 2019-20.  For teams that feel they are on the cusp of contention, that has to have an impact on roster-building strategies — and perhaps it’s no coincidence that the Davis-to-the-Lakers news broke before the etchings on the Larry O’Brien Trophy even had a chance to cool down.  Some oddsmakers already have installed the Lakers as the championship favorites next season, when LeBron James and Davis could give Los Angeles a lethal combination. They vaulted past the Bucks, who were the pre-trade odds-on favorites. Golden State sits at 10-to-1 odds, which is fourth in the pecking order.  Regardless, next season feels wide open. The year after next and beyond? They feel VERY wide open. If the James-Davis pairing fails to take root, the haul Los Angeles gave up — including three players, three first-round picks and the right for New Orleans to swap picks in the 2023 draft — could make it hard on the Lakers to restock on years to come.  Golden State could be dangerous in a year, but free agency looms over the Warriors. The era of Golden State being the defined, prohibitive favorite is over.  What does that mean for the Wolves? Good question. In the short term, probably not much. They sit at 100-to-1 odds to win next year’s title in two different online books, tied for the longest odds with a handful of other teams.  But things can change quickly. Even changing slowly would be meaningful.  • • •  As if you needed a reminder of how fast things can change in sports, the Twins won just 78 games last season. Even after Sunday’s loss, Minnesota at 47-23 is on pace for 109 victories.  • • •  And as if you needed a reminder that baseball has no clock: Friday’s Twins victory took just 2 hours, 21 minutes — their second-fastest game of the season. Sunday’s Twins loss took 4 hours — their second-slowest game of the season.  • • •  I don’t think I was adequately excited for the Women’s World Cup. But after watching three matches over the weekend, including Team USA’s 3-0 victory over Chile on Sunday to advance to the knockout round, I’m hooked.<|im_end|>

# California Gov. Gavin Newsom Discusses His Decision To Halt State Executions

California Gov. Gavin Newsom Discusses His Decision To Halt State Executions  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  The state of California currently has 737 people on death row. For about the next three years, at least, none of them will be executed. That's because, earlier this week, that state's governor, Democrat Gavin Newsom, granted all of them temporary reprieves because he says the death penalty is inconsistent with the bedrock values of being a Californian. Gavin Newsom has long opposed capital punishment. When I spoke with him earlier today, he explained how he thinks about the death penalty differently now that he sits in a governor's office.  GAVIN NEWSOM: It's no longer an intellectual exercise. It's no longer a campaign. It's real. I am entrusted, pursuant to my role and responsibility as governor of California, to make a determination about life or death, to give the order to execute. I just cannot in good conscience do that knowing how racially skewed our criminal justice system is and knowing that it's likely that there are more than a few dozen people on death row in California that are there, wrongly convicted.  CORNISH: Is that something that you know for a fact?  NEWSOM: Well, we know that 164 people, for a fact, have been exonerated from death row since 1973. Academy of Science estimates 4 percent of those on death row are likely to be innocent. You put that in perspective - 737, 4 percent. That's - 30 human beings could be executed under my watch while I have to sleep at night knowing they were innocent.  CORNISH: At the same time, there's roughly 25 people who have exhausted their appeals, which means they've had trials, they have had appeals. They have been through a very lengthy process. What's your response to families who have also had to endure that process? Are you taking away their measure of justice?  NEWSOM: No. And that's the hardest part about this. I've met with dozens of victims, some that are outraged by my reprieve, others that actually and interestingly celebrated it. I met a mother of a 19-year-old who was killed and said, you do not have the right as governor to take away another life in my daughter's name. You will not be doing that. If you do it for my family, you'll be doing that to my family. Very raw, it's very real...  CORNISH: What kind of conversations have you had with people who have said the opposite?  NEWSOM: I was told directly that my job is to eradicate evil. And by executing the person that was responsible for killing this man's daughter, I would be doing that. And while that may be true, it's not just that one individual case that's in front of me. Again, it's hundreds and hundreds of cases, of which two-thirds are people of color, of which one-third are mentally ill in a criminal justice system that not only is skewed racially but also financially. I don't think it is the right thing to do, to execute people with those kind of disparities that are so self-evident in our country.  CORNISH: In 2012, there was a ballot measure that would've eliminated the death penalty that was defeated. Just in 2016, there was a ballot measure that would've eliminated the death penalty. It was defeated.  NEWSOM: Yeah.  CORNISH: California voters have very much spoken on this topic. Are you usurping their will?  NEWSOM: Look, a year after we adjudicated that at the ballot box, someone was exonerated and released from death row. Look, I have the right pursuit to the Constitution, the will of the voters to advance reprieves. Consider this...  CORNISH: And I'm not at all I think trying to challenge your right as a governor to do so. The question is - what do you say to all those people who have voted, repeatedly, in support of the death penalty?  NEWSOM: Well, in many cases, they're the same that voted to give the governor the right to reprieve, which is...  CORNISH: Meaning, by electing you, you think they're also voting on this in some way?  NEWSOM: I think they voted for me for my judgment.  CORNISH: Now, in making this argument the way you are - not just in the state but nationally, right? You're on a media tour right now. Have you essentially given up on a legislative or a voter-driven repeal of the death penalty in California?  NEWSOM: No, I want to end the death penalty in California. As someone who twice, not once, was very public in my opposition in the last two efforts, I hope we bring it back. I'm also considering commutations. It's also afforded to me under the Constitution. And I feel very strongly about that...  CORNISH: I ask because it seems like it's - essentially, you're now doing something single-handedly, right?  NEWSOM: Well, that's - the governor has the right to do that, by the way. This is not unique nor are there - a number of other governors in other states have done this, none, of course, in a state as large as California. And, yes. To answer your question, I do want to end the death penalty in the United States of America. I think it's barbaric. You can still hold people accountable. You could still advance justice by doing the right thing and not perpetuating violence by premeditated executions.  CORNISH: Gavin Newsom is the Democratic governor from California. Thank you for speaking with ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.  NEWSOM: Thank you.

# PrettyLittleThing blasted by shopper, 20, over outrageous bikini sizing

A furious shopper has vowed never to shop at a major online retailer ever again.  Lydia Ramsey took aim at PrettyLittleThing over the shopping favourite's sizing.  The fuming 20-year-old took to social media to blast the company.  She fumed at the firm after ordering a bikini only to find her boobs spilled out of the top.  The mishap came despite buying one bigger than her usual size.  She shared a photo of herself squashed into a blue bikini.  But she told followers on Twitter, in a post which subsequently went viral, that she’s never buying anything from the brand again.  She ordered a size 16 bikini - two sizes up from what she normally wears.  But it still didn’t fit when it arrived, she revealed.  She tweeted: “Never buying a bikini from @OfficialPLT again, sizing is not right.  “This is two sizes bigger than my actual size.”  The bikini cost £25.  “Cannot believe this!” one follower replied.  “I am howling," a second chipped in.  “Happens to me every time and I even size up three sizes for bikini tops," added a frustrated third.  PrettyLittleThing replied, writing: “Sorry to hear about this! Pop us a DM and we'll be able to look into it for you.”<|im_end|>

# Variability of Additive Manufacturing Processes Part 5

Tensile test coupon and check part construction for the six AM processes are described below. FDM The test used the Stratasys Fortus 900mc Aircraft Interiors Configuration with Certified ULTEM 9085™ material. Build parameters were set to the Aircraft Interiors Certification settings. Following the builds, supports were manually removed. Note that material property testing used three discrete batches of Certified ULTEM 9085 to include variances in materials in the overall variability analysis. This was a requirement of the National Institute of Aviation Research (NIAR), under which FDM was tested for the purpose of determining variation and providing a materials dataset. Also note that per NIAR testing standards, 24 tensile test coupons were constructed for XY and ZX orientations. MJF An HP 4200 printer, using the mechanical grade settings for build parameters, produced the test parts in HP’s High Reusability PA 12 material (partially recycled). After removal from the machine, all test parts were media blasted to remove excess powder. Note that five coupons were excluded from the mechanical properties testing because of “jaw breaks” in the tensile testing machine. SLA All test parts were produced in a 3D Systems SLA 7000 using Somos Watershed XC material using the standard build style suggested by DSM (the material manufacturer). Following the builds, test parts were cleaned of excess resin and post-cured for 30 minutes. Note that the SLA 7000 is a legacy printer. However, it was selected for its ability to run Watershed XC, a widely used material. Additionally, the source of the parts confirmed that any differences between the SLA 7000 and the contemporary ProJet 7000 would have minor, if any, effect on the test results. Due to procedural errors, mechanical properties testing used 18 test coupons for the XY orientation and 21 for the ZX orientation rather than the 30 each prescribed in the test plan. However, upon review, the COV results were consistent across the tested coupons, thus making the procedural error negligible. SLS The test used 3D Systems’ Sinterstation 2500 Plus HS machine with EOS PA2201 material (partially recycled). The build parameters used were those for the 42-Watt setting. Test parts received a media blast, after the build, to remove excess powder. Note that three coupons were excluded from the mechanical properties testing because of “jaw breaks” in the tensile testing machine. Also note that the Sinterstation 2500 Plus HS is a legacy machine, but the source of the parts confirmed any difference from contemporary machines would have minor, if any, effect on the test results. FFF Markforged’s Onyx thermoplastic material was used for all test parts, which were constructed in a Markforged Mark X printer (which has since been rebranded as X7). The build parameters include a 100-micron slice and triangular infill with default settings. Following the builds, support structures were manually removed. Note that of the planned 30 test coupons for the vertical (ZX) orientation only fifteen were made. The vertical build orientation for a tall, thin part is unsupported, and after review of the fifteen samples, the production of the balance was cancelled. Also note that the check parts had significant warpage (curl) that prevented measurement. To resolve this, the check parts were heated to 100 °C and then fixtured to remove the warpage. Following this procedure, the flatness of the check parts was within 0.050 in. CLIP Carbon’s M1 printer, with its RPU 70 material, was used to create the test parts. After building, all parts were cleaned in an agitated alcohol bath for three to five minutes and allowed to dry for one hour. The parts were then thermally post-cured for four hours at 120 °C. Note that due to the size of the build area, tensile coupons in the horizontal orientation (XY) and the check part were not compatible with the M1. Test Methods: Mechanical Properties Mechanical properties, including tensile strength, tensile modulus and elongation at break (EAB) were tested by a third-party laboratory according to ASTM D638 testing standards. The coupons (tensile bars) were ASTM D638 Type I with a thickness of 0.130 in. FDM testing was performed in an America Makes program and conducted by RP+M (Avon Lake, Ohio). The testing methodology and procedures followed the National Institute of Aviation Research’s (NIAR) National Center for Advanced Materials and Process (NCAMP) procedures. All testing for the other AM processes was performed by Element Materials Technology (Duarte, Calif.). For each AM process (see Figure 16), 60 coupons were requested. Thirty of these were constructed in a horizontal orientation (flat), which is referred to as ‘XY’. The balance was constructed in a vertical orientation (upright) and are labeled ‘ZX’. To evaluate variation between machines, half (15) of the XY and ZX coupons were built on one machine, and the balance were built on a second machine. Each build contained five coupons, which yielded 12 builds across two machines. The layout for each build was one coupon in the center and one each in the four corners. This layout plan was designed to capture any variation within the AM machines’ build areas. Variability was evaluated through the coefficient of variation (COV). It is a measure of the relative variability that accommodates comparison when the mechanical properties of the AM materials vary significantly. The COV calculation (below) is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean (average). Test Methods: Dimensional Measurements The dimensional inspection was performed with a Mitutoyo QV 606 CMM using a touch probe, which is calibrated annually, and a pre-programmed inspection routine. The inspection routine included 43 separate measurements on 19 features. For each AM process, six check parts were produced in six builds (Figure 17). The builds were split, three each, over two machines. In each build, the check part was located at the center of the build platform and oriented in the XY plane. The intent of the study was to evaluate dimensional accuracy and precision across the extents of the processes’ build areas. Therefore, testing used a check part measuring 9 in. x 9 in. (Figure 18). Due to the significantly smaller build area of the CLIP M1 machine, versus others in this study, this study design element prevented dimensional inspection for CLIP. The check part has three categories of features’ for inspection: large; small, positive; and small, negative. The large features, labeled A, B, C, and D in Figure 18, were measured in multiple locations along both the X and Y axes. Note that for features C and D, the dimensional analysis considers the wall thickness, not the overall size. Figures 19 and 20 show the location of each of these measurements. The small features are mirrored along the centerline (X axis) of the check part, and they are reversed to have identical features that are both positive (cylindrical bosses and rectangular standoffs) and negative (holes, slots and cutouts). The small, positive features are located on the lower left of the check part. These are labeled in Figure 18 as E, F, G, H, I and J. To indicate the axes of measurement, each label has an ‘x’ or ‘y’ appended to the labels for rectangular features. The small, negative features are located on the upper left. These features use the same labeling convention as that for the positive features with the addition of a prime symbol (‘). The locations of the measurements for small features are shown in Figures 21. Note that due to impediments to the CMM inspection routine, three measurements were omitted, H, G‘x and G‘y. Feature H, a cylindrical boss, was eliminated after discovery of a CMM programming error that caused the touch probe to contact feature F. Feature G’ was too narrow for the CMM touch probe to enter.

# Toddler nearly impaled by flying umbrella at North Myrtle Beach

MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (FOX 46 CHARLOTTE) - A child narrowly missed being hit by a beach umbrella flying down a South Carolina shore. His mother is now warning other parents and beachgoers about the potential danger that has resulted in death in the past. Ashton Duggan of Waxhaw was with her husband and son in North Myrtle Beach over the weekend. She was taking a video of the toddler hanging out by the shoreline around 10 a.m. when their umbrella came flying through, nearly slamming into little Henry. "Out of nowhere this umbrella just flies and misses him probably by six inches. It was terrifying," Duggan said. Luckily, the toddler caught sight of it and moved out of the way just in time. He got away unscathed, but his mother was left shaken by the incident. She says a lifeguard had dug the hold for their umbrella, and they felt sure it was secure. "He was probably about five to six yards away from me. The beach was pretty empty at the time. When that happened, I didn't know what to do. I think I threw down my phone and said 'oh my gosh,' and I just ran." Duggan says the lifeguard was horrified by the event as well. She says he came over and apologized, hugging the family. "You just never know what's going to happen and how life could change in the blink of an eye." She says it wasn't too windy that day, but when a strong gust came along, Duggan says it picked up about six umbrellas along the beach. She says it was good the beach was so empty at the time. "Be super aware of your surroundings," Duggan said. "A flying umbrella almost flipped our world upside down." She says she wanted to share the video to raise awareness for others of the quickly a dangerous situation can strike. "I really do think that God's hands had ahold of Henry that morning and I'm thankful for the outcome and that I was able to capture something like this to spread awareness for others. I hope to save a life this summer and summers to come." "You do hear these stories happening every year, and you never really believe it until you see it with your own eyes." She's warning beachgoers to be watchful and stay safe this summer. "I think it's really important to be aware of your surroundings at all times of the day," Duggan said. "Everyone just needs to be on the lookout at all times."<|im_end|>

# Mehul Choksi claims he left India for medical check-up, not because of PNB scam

Diamond merchant Mehul Choksi, who is accused of defrauding the Punjab National Bank of Rs 13,000 crore along with his nephew Nirav Modi, told the Bombay High Court on Monday that he left India for a medical check-up and not because of the scam, PTI reported. In January, he surrendered his Indian citizenship and passport to authorities in Antigua and Barbuda. This came five months after he claimed to have “lawfully applied” to become a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda to expand his business interests in the Caribbean. In the affidavit filed through his advocate Vijay Aggarwal on Monday, Choksi reiterated his claims that he is unable to return to India because of health problems. The Enforcement Directorate had earlier this month called these claims a facade, and pointed out that he can seek treatment in India. “I have not left the country under suspicious circumstances,” Choksi said in the affidavit. “I undertake to travel to India as soon as I am medically fit to travel.” “I am currently residing in Antigua and willing to co-operate in the investigation,” he added, according to ANI. “If court may deem it fit, it may direct the investigating officer to travel to Antigua.” Choksi’s affidavit was in connection with two petitions he has filed in the High Court – one against the Enforcement Directorate’s petition seeking his declaration as a fugitive economic offender, and the other to allow him to cross-examine the persons whose statements form the basis of the agency’s petition. Earlier this month, the Enforcement Directorate told the court that the diamond merchant was a “fugitive and absconder” and his Antiguan citizenship showed he had no intention to return to India for the inquiry against him. The agency said Choksi siphoned off and laundered around Rs 6,097 crore in the alleged scam at Punjab National Bank that was unearthed in February 2018. “It is apparent that the applicant [Choksi] has left India to avoid criminal prosecution for the offence of money laundering under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and continues to refuse to return to India to face criminal prosecution,” the directorate had said. “The sole purpose of the [Fugitive Economic Offenders] Act is to compel the fugitive to return to India and face the proceedings initiated against him.”<|im_end|>

# On the Town: Women’s organization holds annual tea, honors one of its members

The Glendale Women’s Athletic Club is one of the city’s best-kept secrets.  It doesn’t put on any huge fundraisers. Its clubhouse is on the edge of town. Its members would rather hike and do acrobatic yoga. And its 103 members include 12 hardy men.  The club was founded in 1924, in an age when women generally stayed home, few would become world-class athletes.  On June 4, the club held its annual Tea — yes, they do drink tea — featuring the awarding of the Glendale News-Press Perpetual Trophy for Outstanding Sportsmanship by yours truly.  The winner was the very fit Emiko Miller, who has been in the club’s hiking department since 2005. Besides hiking, she doesn’t shirk domestic duties, having put in many hours in the club’s kitchen, washing dishes and cleaning up after meetings. Add good sport to her accolades.  Miller’s family comes from Kyoto, Japan, where she was born and raised.  About 50 years ago, Miller moved to the United States, where she met her second husband. Together, they travel the world on trains, planes and automobiles. Their itinerary also includes river cruises.  This fall, China is on the agenda.  Miller’s activities also include playing mahjong, singing with a choral group and doing yoga.  Following the award ceremony, officers for the 2019-20 year were installed. They included Colleen Shier, president; Susan Edwards, immediate past president; Charlie Bennison, co-president; Sylvia Carson, first vice president; and Elke Allwelt, who will be in charge of membership and the club bulletin.  As a nod to women’s more traditional activities, there is a club quilting department with about 35 members. Their quits are donated to at-risk children in the community and to patients at Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.  “Paint and Sip” was the theme of an evening activity on May 30, put on by the Relief Society at the La Crescenta Stake building of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  The sipping was strictly from sodas and sparkling water. The painting was led by La Crescenta first Ward member and artist Suzi Reil.  Reil went through, step by step, the sketching and painting of a bird. About 40 participants followed her lead and painted their own version of Reil’s bird.  Each attendee had their own acrylic paints, palate and canvas at the ready. Rags were provided for any oopsies.  Kiana Hughes, 6, listened to her inner artist and painted her own version of a bird. Her mom, Jennifer, encouraged her from the sidelines.  The church’s Relief Society was organized on March 17, 1842, in Nauvoo, Ill. Twenty women were present that day.  The society, organized under the mission of charity, adopted the motto, “Charity Never Faileth.”  Membership is free and open to all women in the church 18 years old and older. Today, there are approximately 71 million members in more than 188 countries and territories.  Relief Society members in La Crescenta have recently made baby blankets, quilts and hygiene kits for the community’s homeless and refugee populations, as well as donated school supplies to local needy school children.

# Michigan autonomous ride sharing design has tech where and when you need it

NOVI, Mich. (FOX 2) - In the next decade or so, autonomous vehicles will be all over the roads of Michigan and the country. A southeast Michigan company is developing some tech that will be readily available when you need it. Yanfeng Automotive Interiors has the North American headquarters based in Novi, where they've developed the Xim 20 - which will eventually be built into an electric, autonomous vehicle meant for ride sharing. Tyler Newkirk gave us a tour and showed how shy-tech is going to be readily available for things like your coffee cup. "It senses as soon as it is needed it becomes a feature," Newkirk said, as Roop Raj set his coffee cup down. "It's becoming a cupholder. " The front cabin looks like a coffee shop on wheels. It has a bamboo surface with the shy-tech, which really is high-tech, but it's hidden. It's only revealed when you need it - like when you need to charge your phone. When you call for an Uber or Lyft in the year 2030, maybe you'll be calling this. And you could be riding with a stranger - who is listening to their own music, without headphones. It's tech you've never heard of before that Yangeng says is coming soon. "The system understands where our eyes are, just tracking where our head will be and that approximates where our ears are and there's some special transducers overhead that are sending sound, through energy waves that only become sound at your actual ears," Newkirk said. Don't worry about germs. It cleans itself using UV rays between riders. Execs say you'll start seeing these pop up in the next few years. By the 2030s it will be on the market and by 2040, they say you'll see them everywhere. Jeff Stout with Yanfeng says this is a chance for automakers to provide even more for the riders. "What is the role of the auto maker as they move toward mobility services? Do they provide the ride or do they only provide the car to a mobility service provider? And how do I leverage data to make that ride more affordable?" Stout said.<|im_end|>

# Chelsea news: Merson makes interesting Frank Lampard comparison with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer

That is according to former Arsenal midfielder and Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson, who thinks Chelsea’a transfer ban could be a blessing in disguise for Lampard. Lampard is favourite to take over at Stamford Bridge after the Blues confirmed that Maurizio Sarri has returned to his native Italy to take the reigns at Serie A champions Juventus. Reports suggest Chelsea made their all-time top goalscorer Lampard their top ‘priority’ to replace Sarri when they were sure that he was leaving for Turin. They have not yet approached Lampard’s current club Derby County over buying out his contract, which would cost £4m, but an official bid could is expected to be made in the coming days.   The 40-year-old guided Derby to the Championship play-off final last season, only for them to miss out on a return to the Premier League with defeat to Aston Villa. While he is certainly still inexperienced as a manager, Merson thinks that he could be coming to Chelsea at just the right time where the pressure would not be so great. “He's done a bit of an apprenticeship at Derby. They did great to get into the Championship play-off final,” he told Sky Sports. “But it's not like you're bringing in a manager who's going to be dealing with £70, 80, 90m transfer deals with the pressure on him to bring in players, especially when you haven't been in that situation before and you're talking about inexperience. “The fans will be patient with him because he's a legend” Paul Merson “(Ole Gunnar) Solskjaer - he's been manager of Molde, didn't do great at Cardiff and he's got to be bringing in players of that level. But with Frank, he comes in and the team's there, the fans will be patient with him because he's a legend. I think he ticks the boxes. “If he comes in too, Jody Morris has already been at the club, he knows the kids who are coming through. There are a lot more of those kids at Chelsea and it is more of a chance to give them a chance instead of bringing players in and the crowd asking what they brought him in for.” Merson had a word of warning for the club, however, that they may regret their indifference towards Sarri despite the Italian guiding them to third place in the Premier League, the Europa League title and the final of the Carabao Cup. Sarri reportedly also found transfer chief Marina Granovskaia difficult to deal with and was jeered at times from the stands. “The football hasn't been great under Sarri,” Merson added. “Season wise though, it's not been bad. I hope we don't look back next season and think, cor, he was good - they only finished behind Liverpool and Manchester City. “To come third and winning a European final - it's the tournament they were in too, they didn't drop out of the Champions League - could they have done much more? “The pressure was: he didn't really play (Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi), was predictable with Jorginho, and the football at Stamford Bridge wasn't great, it started off entertaining and then fizzled out. “It was a catalogue of things in the end. But you don't want to be sitting there asking why they let him go next season.”<|im_end|>

# Sources: J.P. Morgan working on a secretive digital banking project based out of London – TechCrunch

A number of incumbent backs are known to be developing new digital-first products in a bid to keep the new wave of challenger banks at bay and now it appears that the latest to make that move is J.P. Morgan.  According to sources, the investment bank has begun recruiting for a secretive skunkworks project within London’s burgeoning fintech industry. Very few details are known about what exactly J.P. Morgan plans to build, although TechCrunch understands the bank is busy hiring high level developers with full-stack and cloud-based dev skills for the new project, along with other personnel.  One source tells me that interested candidates are being asked to sign an NDA, and that the project is still in its formative stages. They say the plan is to essentially build a startup within a corporation that will be run independently and entirely separately from J.P. Morgan’s existing technology and businesses. The bank is only hiring for permanent positions rather than contractors in order to keep it “secret,” another source tells me.  Meanwhile, for the few people I’ve spoken to who have heard about the project there’s speculation that J.P. Morgan is developing a competitor to “Marcus,” the digital bank launched by Goldman Sachs that focuses on savings and offers a competitive interest rate. That would also put it up against challenger banks such as Atom, Tandem and savings marketplace Raisin.  However, one source tells me they’ve heard that J.P. Morgan’s skunkworks project could in fact be a much more ambitious cloud-based banking platform on which numerous products can be launched. That would be more akin to a core banking SaaS platform or “AWS for Banking,” along the lines of Starling’s core banking product or Germany’s solarisBank or London’s 11:FS Foundry.<|im_end|>

# Airbus launches 'long range' plane that can fly huge distances

Airbus has launched a long-range plane that will mean more direct long-haul flights from the UK to India and the USA.  The A321XLR jet, which is part of the A321neo family, will also mean more new routes to countries including China and Australia.  The plane has a 30 per cent lower fuel burn per seat than previous-generation competitor aircraft and will have a range of 4,700 nautical miles (5,400 miles).  The aircraft was revealed at the Paris Airshow and is due to go into operation in 2023.  A spokesperson for Airbus said: "With this added range, airlines will be able to operate a lower-cost single-aisle aircraft on longer and less heavily travelled routes – many of which can now only be served by larger and less efficient wide-body aircraft.  "This will enable operators to open new world-wide routes such as India to Europe or China to Australia, as well as further extending the Family’s non-stop reach on direct transatlantic flights between continental Europe and the Americas.  “For passengers, the A321XLR’s new Airspace cabin will provide the best travel experience, while offering seats in all classes with the same high-comfort as on long-haul widebody aircraft.”  The new plane has new permanent Rear Centre Tank (RCT) for more fuel volume; a modified landing gear for an increased maximum take-off weight of 101 metric tonnes; and an optimised wing trailing-edge flap configuration to preserve the same take-off performance and engine thrust requirements as today’s A321neo.  The new tank will be able to hold more fuel, while taking up less space in the cargo hold, freeing-up underfloor volume for additional cargo and baggage on long range routes.  The A320neo family is the world’s best-selling single aisle aircraft with over 6,500 orders from more than 100 customers since its launch in 2010.  It incorporates new-generation engines and wing-tip devices plus other improvements which bring double-digit fuel savings over its predecessor.

# The six running to become Britain's PM - Journal du Cameroun

The six contenders left in the race to replace Theresa May as Britain’s prime minister are scrambling for votes in Tuesday’s second ballot of the 313 Conservative MPs.  Any candidate with fewer than 33 votes on Tuesday drops out, otherwise the one with the lowest tally is eliminated.  The campaign is being fought over their Brexit positions.  Here are the last six standing:  – Boris Johnson –  First round votes: 114  The former foreign secretary, 54, says he would get Britain out of the EU “deal or no deal” when the October 31 deadline set by EU leaders comes around.  But he has also said a no-deal Brexit would be “a last resort, not something that anybody desires”.  He has threatened to withhold the country’s Brexit bill if the EU does not offer improved withdrawal terms, and to scrap a controversial provision for the Irish border contained in the current divorce deal — both of which would be unacceptable to Brussels.  A figurehead in the 2016 campaign to leave the EU, he was May’s foreign secretary until he resigned over her Brexit strategy last year.  Charismatic and popular with grassroots Conservatives, he swept the first round and won the backing of eliminated candidates Matt Hancock and Esther McVey.  – Jeremy Hunt –  First round votes: 43  The current foreign secretary supported remaining in the EU but has switched since then.  The former businessman is a resilient politician, having headed the National Health Service for six years during a funding crisis.  The 52-year-old says he will push hard for a new deal with Brussels, but is prepared to leave without a deal if no new offer is forthcoming.  Thursday’s vote left him in pole position to join Johnson in the final two, when grassroots Conservative members pick their party’s new leader.  – Michael Gove –  First round votes: 37  The cerebral 51-year-old is among the most ardent eurosceptics left in May’s government but is seen as a possible unifying figure between the two wings of the party.  Considered the second favourite, his campaign got off to a rocky start when he admitted using cocaine two decades ago.  Gove has signalled he could be open to delaying Brexit again rather than leave without a deal on October 31.  If he makes the final two, a Johnson versus Gove clash could be mouthwatering. Gove backed Johnson in the 2016 leadership contest, but then politically knifed him to run himself.  – Dominic Raab –  First round votes: 27  An ardent eurosceptic with a black belt in karate, the 45-year-old former Brexit minister resigned in protest at May’s negotiating strategy with Brussels in November.  He says Britain should be ready to walk away from the EU without an agreement while still trying to negotiate a better deal than the one May signed.  Raab sparked controversy by saying he would be willing to suspend parliament to force through a no-deal departure if necessary.  – Sajid Javid –  First round votes: 23  A former investment banker and the son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver, Javid, 49, wants to be the face of a modern, multi-cultural and meritocratic Britain.  An economic liberal, Javid voted for Britain to stay in the EU in 2016 but has since become an advocate of Brexit.  He wants to leave on October 31, preferably with a deal but would prefer no deal over no Brexit.  He has the notable endorsement of Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson.  Javid said Monday he was “extremely confident” of reaching the 33-vote threshold.  – Rory Stewart –  First round votes: 19  The international development secretary, 46, is a former Foreign Office official who served in the coalition administration in Iraq following the US-led invasion in 2003. He says a no-deal would be “damaging”.  Initially a rank outsider, his social media-driven campaign has garnered momentum as the most opposed to a no-deal Brexit.  However, the people he needs to win over are not non-Conservatives on Twitter but the 50 MPs who voted Thursday for candidates who have dropped out.  He says he now has 33 backers “if they do what they say”.<|im_end|>

# Sheyi Ojo: Rangers sign Liverpool winger on season-long loan

Sheyi Ojo: Rangers sign Liverpool winger on season-long loan  Liverpool winger Sheyi Ojo has joined Rangers on a season-long loan. Ojo, who has 88 club appearances, spent last season on loan at Stade Reims in France before signing a new five-year deal at European champions Liverpool. The 21-year-old arrived at the Ibrox club's training centre on Monday and is their fifth summer signing after Steven Davis, Jordan Jones, Jake Hastie and Greg Stewart all joined. Ojo's move is subject to international clearance. "The last 18 months to two years I've not had that consistent opportunity," he told Rangers TV. "When I heard Rangers were involved I spoke to my representatives, the gaffer and Steven Gerrard. I believed this was the right destination for me. "With Rangers this season it is to play how I've always played, freely and just enjoy my football." Steven Gerrard's side begin their season in the Europa League next month.

# Blackstone chief donates $188 million to Oxford University

LONDON (Reuters) - The head of private equity firm Blackstone has pledged 150 million pounds ($188.37 million) to Oxford University, the biggest single donation in its history, to fund a centre for humanities that would also house an institute to study the ethics of artificial intelligence. Stephen Schwarzman, chairman, chief executive and co-founder of Blackstone which has about $500 billion in assets, said the donation would fund the Schwarzman Centre that would support programmes ranging from history to music. The centre will also house a new Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence (AI). “For nearly 1,000 years, the study of the humanities at Oxford has been core to Western civilisation and scholarship. We need to ensure that its insights and principles can be adapted to today’s dynamic world,” Schwarzman said in a statement. The university said the centre would consider the impact of AI, which could “challenge the very nature of what it means to be human and transform most aspects of our lives”. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, said in the statement: “If AI is to benefit humanity we must understand its moral and ethical implications. Oxford with its rich history in humanities and philosophy is ideally placed to do this.” About a quarter of Oxford University students study humanities, including modern languages, theology, philosophy and English. New facilities funded by the donation would include a 500-seat concert hall and a 250-seat auditorium. Schwarzman has also donated to U.S. universities, including $350 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and $150 million to Yale. He founded a $575 million international scholarship programme in 2013 at China’s Tsinghua University. ($1 = 0.7963 pounds) Reporting by Simon Jessop; Editing by Edmund Blair<|im_end|>

# Maine moose biologist honored by colleagues with award

Maine’s state moose biologist was honored by his peers last week when he was given the Distinguished Moose Biologist award at the 53rd North American Moose Conference, which was held at Sugarloaf in Carrabassett Valley.  Lee Kantar of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife was recognized for his extensive field research, which includes designing, conducting and overseeing the state’s moose survival study, and his other roles as the point person in Maine’s moose management effort.  Peter Pekins, a professor of wildlife ecology at the University of New Hampshire, has worked with Kantar and is a past recipient of the same award. He praised Kantar’s efforts at the conference in a DIF&W press release.  “Maine has the most progressive and scientific moose management program in the United States, and Lee is the engine that drives that. He is most deserving of the award,” Pekins said.  The award was established in 1981 to honor and publicize the outstanding contribution of individuals and/or organizations to moose management. It is not given out every year.  Since its inception, recipients include those from the United States, Canada, Sweden, Finland and Norway.  Kantar was hired as the state’s deer biologist in 2005 and volunteered to add moose to his responsibilities two years later. He worked on both species for five years before focusing his attention solely on moose beginning in 2012.  Maine has the largest moose herd — more than 60,000 animals — in the lower 48 states. According to the release, unregulated hunting, the clearing of forest land for farming and an increase in brainworm associated with a growing deer population resulted in the herd shrinking to about 2,000 in the early 1900s.  Kantar was nominated for the award by Walter Jakubas, head of the DIF&W’s mammal group.  “Since his hire, he has transformed and built a moose management program that is arguably one of the most modern and comprehensive programs in the States,” Jakubas said.”He has become a pillar of moose management in the northeastern U.S. and North America, and without question, is deserving of this honor and recognition.”  Jakubas cited Kantar’s work in putting radio collars on more than 500 moose over a five-year span, and his cooperative efforts with biologists in New Hampshire and Vermont, which will help researchers better understand moose on a more regional level.  “Lee’s work and dedication to Maine’s moose is exceptional,” DIF&W commissioner Judy Camuso said. “Maine’s moose survival study is pioneering in both its scope and numbers and has been a model for other states and provinces.”<|im_end|>

# Enquiry called into Conwy Council’s ‘witch hunt’ against farmer - Farming UK News

A farming union has called for an enquiry into Conwy Council’s 'witch hunt' against the farmer who beat thousands of other hopefuls to take over a farm for just £1 a year. The council's prosecution against Daniel Jones, a fourth-generation farmer from Anglesey, dramatically collapsed earlier in June. He made international headlines in 2016 when he was named new shepherd for the 124-acre Parc Farm in Great Orme, North Wales. Mr Jones had originally faced twenty charges brought on by the council, including failure to dispose of three dead sheep carcases and failure to keep a register of animal movements. But the Farmers’ Union of Wales (FUW) has now demanded Conwy Borough County Council to conduct a full investigation into its decision to 'aggressively pursue' a case against Mr Jones after the case against him collapsed. When the council decided to drop charges and abandon the case district judge Gwyn Jones told Mr Jones: “Your good name remains.” However, to pay for his legal defence Mr Jones, who is married with a young son, has had to borrow £50,000 from his family. He's also had to sell 300 sheep and farm machinery. And despite the case having collapsed, there is little prospect of any costs awarded by the court coming close to covering the Jones’ expenses. In a letter to Conwy Council's Chief Executive, Iwan Davies, the FUW accuses the council of having adopted an “...aggressive approach which seemed to stand in stark contrast to those adopted by most Local Authorities”. It adds: “As matters progressed, it became clear to those who have dealt with other such cases across Wales that the council had taken a decision to aggressively pursue Mr Jones in what has rightly been compared to a ‘witch hunt’.” The letter goes on to highlight that the financial and mental impact for the family has been 'tremendous' and will have 'long-lasting effects' on Mr Jones, his wife, son and their wider family. It says the approach adopted by the council has also brought it into 'significant disrepute' locally, and across the UK, with the case being reported in national newspapers. The letter concludes that: “Given such an array of damaging impacts, both on a personal level for the Jones family and a reputational level for the council, we believe a full investigation into the decision to pursue this case and the methods adopted by council officials is warranted, and that this should be instigated as soon as possible.”<|im_end|>

# Tempo driver who clashed with Delhi cops was earlier booked for assaulting gurdwara sevadar

NEW DELHI: A tempo driver, who was thrashed by policemen allegedly after he attacked one of them with a sword in northwest Delhi, was booked in April for assaulting the 'sevadar' of the Bangla Sahib Gurdwara, police said.  The driver, Sarabjeet Singh, had brushes with the law earlier as well.  He had been booked under preventive sections (107/151 CrPC ) in the years 2006, 2011 and 2013 by the Delhi Police.  While section 107 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) pertains to the apprehension of breach of peace and tranquillity of an area, section 151 pertains to arrest to prevent the commission of cognisable offences.  In April this year, he allegedly assaulted sevadar Mangal Singh when the latter asked him why he and his son were sleeping near the 'sarovar' for the last three-four days.  Mangal Singh alleged in his complaint that when he and his colleague asked them about their whereabouts and why they were sleeping there, the driver got furious and started arguing with him.  The complainant informed the gurudwara manager about it and while they were taking the two to the gurudwara, his son tried to escape.  However, he was caught and Sarabjeet Singh assaulted the complainant.  A complaint was lodged against Sarabjeet Singh at the Parliament Street Police Station.  Meanwhile, the police said that the Crime Branch would go through the videos of the Mukherjee Nagar incident.  The case had been transferred to the Crime Branch which would "independently" probe the two cross FIRs registered on the statements of the police personnel and the driver.  A senior crime branch official said they were yet to receive the files, but officials had already scanned through four-five CCTV footages of the incident.  Videos that had gone viral soon after the incident would also be scanned thoroughly to establish the exact sequence of events.  Statements would be recorded of all those seen in the clips, the official said.  Some of the onlookers had been identified and they would be questioned to understand the cause of the incident.  Statements of the police personnel and the tempo driver would also be taken, the official added.  The AAP's auto rickshaw wing on Tuesday urged Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik to ensure the safety of auto drivers and that incidents of violence like the Mukherjee Nagar one do not recur.  Meanwhile, the situation in the area continued to remain tense with the police beefing up security to ensure that no untoward incident takes place.  On Sunday evening, a brawl between the tempo driver, and policemen at northwest Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar went viral on social media.  In one of the purported videos, the tempo driver was seen chasing the policemen with a sword following which other policemen arrived at the scene and they thrashed the driver and his son with batons while overpowering them.  The police said the altercation between took place after the tempo driver's vehicle collided with a police van.  Eight police personnel were injured in the scuffle, the police said.  Swinging into action, the Delhi Police had suspended three policemen for "unprofessional behaviour" and initiated a probe.  Joint Commissioner of Police (Northern Range) Manish Kumar Agarwal is separately conducting a detailed inquiry into the matter.<|im_end|>

# Citizens Insurance reduces rate hike

Citizens Property Insurance is scaling back a proposed rate hike after lawmakers and Gov. Ron DeSantis approved an overhaul that the state-backed insurer has long pursued. Members of Citizens’ Actuarial and Underwriting Committee advanced a plan Tuesday to the full Board of Governors to lower a proposed average residential premium increase from 8.2 percent to 4.7 percent. The board will take up the issue Wednesday. The 8.2 percent increase was approved in December but has not taken effect. The reduction in the overall hike is possible, according to Citizens officials, following passage of a new law (HB 7065) that overhauled the controversial practice known as assignment of benefits, which involves policyholders signing over insurance claims to contractors. The initial rate hike was approved with members blaming water-damage claims and related litigation, particularly in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, for driving up costs in the broader property-insurance market.<|im_end|>

# E-wallet firms tussle for bigger slice of the pie - VnExpress International

Vimo Technology JSC, a mobile wallet provider, and Vietnam mPOS Technology JSC, which develops portable point-of-sale technology, recently merged into one entity called NextPay Holdings. NextPay Holdings aims to raise $30 million from foreign investors as it seeks an upper hand in the Vietnamese fintech market. NextPay CEO Nguyen Huu Tuat said that the fintech industry has a small profit margin, and only two or three companies with the highest number of customers can thrive in this crowded market. The merger will give NextPay a wider customer base and be more competitive, he told VnExpress International. "We now account for about 13-15 percent of Vietnam’s point of sales market, and we want to bring this number to 40-50 percent in the next three years." The company is also eyeing Myanmar and Indonesia in its expansion plan next year. Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup last month acquired digital wallet app MonPay to integrate cashless payment service into its VinID app where customers can accumulate points through goods and services bought from the group’s ecosystem. MoMo, the most popular e-wallet in the country, earlier this year raised $100 million from U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus, following previous investments of $25 million from Standard Chartered and $3 million from Goldman Sachs. Economist Nguyen Tri Hieu said that the mergers and acquisitions in the fintech industry show that companies are seeing an urgent need to increase their market share. "If a company cannot change the spending habit of a large number of users, it won’t make a profit and will lose in the race," he said. Vietnam has seen robust expansion of fintech companies in recent years as the government encourages cashless transactions.. There were 29 licensed payment service providers apart from local banks as of February, according to the State Bank of Vietnam. Among these, 20 offer e-wallets. Between 2016-2018, the number of fintech companies in Vietnam rose from 40 to almost 100, among the 26 are payment service providers which have received government’s permission. The government is working to accelerate the use of cashless transactions. In a resolution released January, it tasked the central bank to come up with solutions that would promote the use of e-wallets, which allow users to deposit cash into their e-wallets without the need for a bank account. Vietnam’s fintech market was valued at $4.4 billion in 2017 and is estimated to reach $7.8 billion in 2020, according to market research firm Solidiance. The use of cash in Vietnam remains high. World Bank statistics released last year showed that the country had the lowest percentage of cashless transactions in the region with only 4.9 percent, while this value for China and Thailand were 26.1 percent and 59.7 percent respectively.<|im_end|>

# VIDEO: Birth siblings connect 73 years later - Williams Lake Tribune

A Williams Lake man who found his birth sister after 73 years said the experience has been nothing but positive.  “It’s been really great and so awesome for this to happen,” Clayton Myers said as he sat beside his sister Donna Smith and held her hand.  Last week Donna made her first trip to Williams Lake, travelling with her daughter and son-in-law.  The two siblings said they first met through letters, then a conference call at the prompting of an adoption agency in Saskatchewan.  After that, Clayton, and his wife Karen travelled to Abbotsford to meet Donna and her husband at their home.  To this day Karen still thinks it was amazing how welcoming Donna was right away.  “She didn’t know anything about us and yet she invited us into her home,” Karen said.  Donna said she believes God brought them together.  “We’ve been able to have a few visits in person and we talk on the phone and text,” she said. “We’ve learned so much about our family.”  It was curiosity about their medical histories that first inspired Clayton and Donna to inquire about their backgrounds.  “Being adopted you don’t know what kind of health problems you may have in the future,” Clayton said.  Initially he received a 45-page package from the adoption agency, but said there was no medical information included.  Around the same time, Donna was also making inquiries because her children wanted to know about her medical background.  Clayton was born in Regina in 1934 and Donna was born in Saskatoon in1936. They shared the same birth mother and father.  Once Clayton and Donna were put in touch with their birth family, they discovered their parents were married in 1937 and went on to have five more children — two boys and three girls.  Their birth mother died at age 93 in 2007 and their birth father died on their 50th wedding anniversary.  Growing up, the five other siblings knew nothing about Clayton and Donna and were totally shocked to learn about them, Donna said.  “I think there was skepticism about whether we belonged in the family or not, but you cannot blame them, after all these years,” Clayton said. “I think after they saw how much Donna was like their mother, it put the icing on the cake.”  Clayton first learned he was adopted from his older sister when he was about 15 or 16 years old.  “My sister was living in Saskatoon at the time and I went in to visit her and she told me. I cried over it, because looking back at all the years I didn’t even know that. Then she tried to deny it, but I said, ‘no, you’ve told me and it’s got to be true.’ It was OK. I accepted it, but it was a shock.”  When he talked to his adoptive parents about it, he never learned why they had kept it a secret.  “I think it’s the way those things went in the early years. I knew another boy at school who was adopted and some of the kids found out and they made his life pretty terrible. They teased him. It was pretty tough for him.”  Donna was five years old when a neighbour girl got angry at her and told her she was adopted.  “I’d never heard the term before so I went home crying to mom so she sat me down and told me babies came from two different ways,” she said. “‘God gives them to mommies and daddies or you write a letter,’ she said. ‘We got you as a letter baby so we chose you.’ So I said to my brother, ‘they had to take you, but they chose me.’”  Her adoptive mother told her her background, but Donna said at the time she wasn’t interested.  “I told them ‘I love you, you’re my mom and dad and I don’t care about anything else.’ I was young, I wasn’t thinking ahead.”  Donna was born at the Salvation Army unwed mother home in Saskatoon.  “When I was two weeks old I came up on the train to my parents with a welfare worker to Melfort, Sask.,” Donna said.  Her adoptive mom had been in a car accident and was told she would never have children so they put in for adoption.  “Eighteen months after I was adopted she had my brother and then 14 and 17 years later had two more girls after I was 16. I was so excited. Mom cried because she thought I’d be so embarrassed.”  Donna said the beauty of her life is that with her adoption she was never treated any differently than her siblings growing up.  “They were blonde and blue-eyed so I said I was the black sheep of the family. But my dad had dark hair and when they wrote to the welfare department for adoption a letter came back with four babies described. Dad chose the baby with dark hair and blue eyes. By the time I got to them two weeks later my eyes had turned brown, but they kept me anyway.” Clayton’s older sister was adopted as well, but she was quite a bit older than him so he did not have a lot of time with her, he said.  Donna has four children, 21 grandchildren and an 18th great grandchild due in August.  Her husband died last year after they had been married for 63 years.  Clay has three children and three grandchildren.  “Being apart the way we are, with our age and our health, it’s difficult and I would just love Clay to meet all of my family,” Donna said.  Smiling Karen said she had enjoyed watching the two siblings making oatmeal together in the kitchen.  “It has just been such a miracle that they even met,” she said.<|im_end|>

# dpr-nscdc-begin-clampdown-on-illegal-cooking-gas-dealers

Uche Usim, Abuja  A concerted effort to prevent fire outbreak and other environmental hazards has led to the clampdown on illegal cooking gas dealers nationwide by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).  The two agencies commenced the onslaught in Abuja on Wednesday where they raided various areas in the Federal Capital Territory to flush out LPG (cooking gas) retailers and skid operators. Five illegal operators were arrested during the raid and will be prosecuted to serve as sufficient deterrent to potential culprits of illegal cooking gas sales.  The team went to Galadimawa, Lokogoma (particularly Sunny Vale estate) and other areas within the city.  The team nabbed various illegal operators dispensing gas in very dangerous circumstances without recourse to laid down safety precautions.  Commenting on the development while sacking illegal outlets in Galadimawa, DPR Head of Gas, Umar Gwandu said the environment could easily be engulfed by fire in an accident.  “This place can easily explode if there is any spark, even with a very tiny leakage. Once there is a spark, this place is gone.  “We have come here severally as you can see from our seal. These people are not ready to comply. If there is any spark here this place can go up in flames in seconds. Look at the immediate environment with gas,” Gwandu stated.  According to him, basic/standard minimum requirements like fire extinguishers/detectors, water sprinkler, temperature gauge, pressure and volume gauge among others were usually not available various illegal facilities.  In an interview after the raid, the Zonal Operations Controller DPR Abuja Zonal Office, Buba Abubakar said the team visited about 16 retail plants on Wednesday, adding that 14 illegal outlets were sealed.  “The reason we went out today was to make sure everybody has permit to operate. If you don’t have permit, you should come to the office and with the necessary requirements you will get your permit. We are looking at the safety of the people, their lives and property. By the time you come to the office, we will be able to tell you the things you need to have a retail outlet.   “But the way it is now, somebody just wakes up one day and before you know it, he has a retail outlet which is not acceptable. We are here to help every Nigerian. If you really want to have a retail outlet or LPG plant, you come to the office, we will tell you all the necessary requirement in terms of documentation and safety and by the time you get these things done we will process them for you before you are allowed to run a legal outlet”, he explained.  On requirements and cost of set up, Abubakar said: “I can’t tell you how much is required to set up but the requirements are that you have to have your company papers, the site must meet our requirement. You can’t go to a government land and mount your vessel there and start selling. We will tell you the size of the land, measurement from vessel to the fence and whether it is residential, school or mosque.”  On whether the clampdown was consistent with federal government’s policy to encourage LPG penetration, he said: “Yes, we want this gas to be everywhere but let it be done legally. And in line with the Federal government’s ease of doing business, that’s why we tell them to come to the office, we are ready to assist any marketer that wants to establish any facility for LPG or retail outlet to assist and make sure they get their permit very fast.  Abubakar added that those arrested have been handed to the NSCDC for further actions and prosecution.  With regard to how the illegal gas dealers get their supplies he said: “They have gas marketers that they get these things from. That is why we sensitise even the major players that they should not just be selling gas to anyhow retailer because he has to present his permit before you sell gas because gas is very volatile than PMS,” he added.<|im_end|>

# Andrew Scheer’s climate plan to focus on ‘tech not taxes’ with investment rules - National | Globalnews.ca

Andrew Scheer’s climate plan to focus on ‘tech not taxes’ with investment rules  Andrew Scheer‘s long-awaited climate plan will put emphasis on private-sector green technology investments and affirm a commitment to meeting Canada’s emission reduction targets under the Paris Agreements.  A Conservative official told Global News ahead of the plan’s scheduled release on Wednesday evening that “tech, not taxes” is the guiding focus for the Conservative leader’s plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and spur private-sector investment in green technology. The plan, which Scheer has previously said will include cutting the carbon tax, would set emissions standards requiring major emitters to cut greenhouse gases by an as-yet-unclear amount and which will force them to invest in private-sector research and development of green technology. Those amounts will fluctuate based on the standards set for varying industries but would not be finalized unless the Conservatives are elected. CBC News reported on Tuesday night that the plan would apply to large-scale polluters with more than 40 kilotonnes per year in emissions. Under the current Liberal carbon tax, emission caps kick in for polluters that emit more than 50 kilotonnes per year. WATCH BELOW: Scheer says Canada needs ‘real plan’ to tackle climate change as flooding continues  Under the standards described by the official, big polluters could meet those investment requirements by investing in subsidiaries of Canadian companies to do eligible research and development for emissions-reducing technology, a pool of industrial research and development green tech investments, and Canadian green bonds or financial tools focusing on emissions-reducing technology. They could also invest in Canadian clean technology companies that are piloting or adopting similar technology to reduce emissions, or into programs at Canadian colleges or universities focused on developing clean technology. The official said the intent of the plan is to put Canada in the “best position” to hit its emission reduction targets under the Paris Agreement while also ensuring that any money generated as a result of the reduction standards placed on industry stays in the private sector. Canada’s commitment under the Paris Agreement is to reduce its emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, based off 2005 levels. The Parliamentary Budget Officer said last week that the government may need a higher carbon tax in order to reduce emissions to hit that target but the Liberals maintain that they are on track and remain committed to hitting the targeted reduction levels. Climate change has become a significant political issue for the governing Liberals, who frequently use Scheer’s lack of a plan to lambaste him as a leader who will not prioritize the risks of a changing climate if elected as prime minister. Scheer promised last year to release a climate plan but has taken until now to do so.  © 2019 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.<|im_end|>

# US military drone shot down by Iranian missile – American official

A US military drone has been shot down by an Iranian missile near to the country's airspace. Unnamed US officials quoted by Reuters and AP news agencies said the intelligence drone was downed in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz, south of Iran.  This contradicts reports by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency which said the country's Revolutionary Guard had shot down an American drone in its airspace  IRNA said the drone was hit when it entered Iranian airspace near the Kouhmobarak district in southern Iran's Hormozgan province. Citing the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, IRNA identified the drone as an RQ-4 Global Hawk, a high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aircraft designed to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.  Navy Captain Bill Urban, a US Central Command spokesman, earlier denied the reports. "No US aircraft were operating in Iranian airspace today," he said.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said President Donald Trump had been "briefed on the reports of a missile strike in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia". "We are closely monitoring the situation and continuing to consult with or partners and allies," she added. It comes a day after Washington announced it was sending another 1,000 troops to the Middle East in response to what it described as "hostile behaviour" by Iranian forces. The US has blamed Iran for attacks on tankers and cargo ships in the Gulf of Oman and Strait of Hormuz, a major transit route for global oil supplies. On Wednesday the US navy released pictures of pieces of mines recovered after the attacks which it said "strikingly" resemble those belonging to Iran. Officials showed debris and a magnet recovered, they said, from the tanker Kokuka Courageous to reporters at the US navy's 5th Fleet base near Fujairah, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  Iran's Revolutionary Guard left them behind when they removed an unexploded limpet mine after the attack, the officials claimed. Tehran has denied any involvement. Tensions between the two countries have increased since Mr Trump last year withdrew America from the 2015 international nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Iran has threatened to pull out of its commitments under the Obama-era agreement and increase its uranium enrichment to 20% if new and better terms with world powers are not reached on its nuclear programme. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani issued the 60-day ultimatum to the remaining signatories of the nuclear deal - Britain, China, the European Union, France and Germany - in May. The 2015 deal limits Iran to enriching uranium to 3.67%, which can fuel a commercial nuclear power plant. Weapons-grade uranium needs to be enriched to around 90%. However, once a country enriches uranium to around 20%, scientists say the time needed to reach 90% is halved.<|im_end|>

# Rockwell Pond park input needed

public input meetings to hear what residents want to see included in a future park to be built just north of Rockwell Pond. Two meetings have already been held and three more are scheduled. Recreation and Community Services Director Mikal Kirchner said getting public input is a crucial part of the process as the City must qualify and earn as many points as possible to be moved higher up the priority list as the state decides which park will get funding. Other criteria include having household incomes under $47,000 and having fewer than three acres of park space per 1,000 people in town. “Our goal, since the city owns Rockwell Pond, is to put in bike and walking trails and maybe a water feature and a new bridge to tie into the new developments around Wal-Mart,” Kirchner said at the June 13 meeting. A small group of residents gathered in the northwest section of Pioneer Village where the meetings are taking place. Hosting the meetings within a half-mile of the project helps the City get more points as well, Kirchner said. The City is hoping to receive anywhere from $3-6 million to develop the park. Kirchner provided some background on previous efforts to get public input and shared some ideas proposed at an initial meeting. “There are no right or wrong answers,” he said. The grant however will focus on building amenities that can be used by a broad spectrum of residents, and not just very specific interest groups. At a previous meeting June 11, residents’ ideas included soccer fields, an amphitheater, spray park, special-needs playground, picnic shelters, walking and biking trails, remote-control racetracks, concession stand and a community garden. To give attendees an idea of how large the proposed park would be, Kirchner said Shaffer Park is almost 22 acres and the Rockwell Pond park would be at least seven acres larger than that. Many residents are asking for just open grassy park space since after-school sports groups can no longer use school grounds after school like they used to years ago. “Every school now has after-school programs, so youth soccer and football are always looking for space,” Kirchner said. In attendance at this session was long-time wrestler Robert Sepulveda who said he’s been wrestling since he was nine years old. He now coaches Team Selma wrestling and is eager to see a facility built that would be large enough to accommodate even larger tournaments than they can host at Selma High. He’s also eager to see a location where residents could enjoy physical fitness routines in a more natural setting than running laps in a circle. “It gives me a good feeling that there are people who see that there’s a need for a facility. I didn’t realize it was a concern of our community. Within the wrestling group, it’s a concern of 99 percent of the people, but to see other community members agree that there’s a need, that made feel really good right now.” Selma Mayor Scott Robertson attended this session as well and said he’d like to see a park created that would give residents more fitness opportunities. “I’m excited about bringing more park space to Selma since we haven’t had any [new parks] since we built Shaffer in the 1980s. It’s just been too long. We need to get something the community can use and have Selma better and more livable.” Also, having a new park situated just off Highway 99 would draw in more visitors to town who would then likely make purchases while visiting. Those additional tax dollars would be a boost to the local economy as well. “You bring them into the park and then they could buy boots, a car or get some dinner. There are just a lot of opportunities for Selma to grow since [the park] would be the first attraction along 99,” Robertson said. Kirchner said since there would be an increase in traffic once the park is built, the city would look to improve Floral Avenue and widen Dewolf Avenue in time. Also, the City is working with Caltrans to develop an overpass on Dinuba Boulevard to give residents another route to the heavily visited area of town. One suggestion at a Council meeting was to fill Rockwell Pond or move the earth to allow more of the area to be developed into a park. However, since the Rockwell Pond is needed to collect excessive rain water, that land must be used for groundwater recharge. Thus, the park would be developed on the 28 acres to the north of Rockwell Pond. The deadline to submit an application for the grant monies is coming up in August and then the city would have to wait to hear back from the state, most likely in January. “Then we can make plans, on that basis, about acquiring more land,” Robertson said. Kirchner said it’s always been a goal of his to have a community center and two more parks built in Selma as having a place for children to simply run and play is needed throughout the community. “You want to take your kids and play Frisbee or a pick-up game. There’s nothing like going to the park and letting your kids run and play. They like that because then they have their space.”<|im_end|>

# 5 Must-See Announcements From Shopify's Unite Conference

On Wednesday, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), the leading provider of e-commerce tools for businesses of all sizes, hosted Shopify Unite, the annual conference that brings together its global partner and developer community. At the yearly event, Shopify provided a laundry list of updates regarding platform additions and enhancements designed to give merchants the tools they need to build and manage an online business. Investors got a boost of confidence from these developments, driving the stock up more than 7% in the wake of the announcements. Continue Reading Below Let's take a look at some of the most noteworthy revelations and how they're positioning Shopify -- and its merchants -- for the future. 1. Shopify Fulfillment Network Taking a page from Amazon.com, the master of e-commerce, the company debuted the Shopify Fulfillment Network, "a new way to get orders to your customers quickly and easily." Qualifying merchants in the U.S. will be eligible to apply for early access to the program, which offers a dedicated network of fulfillment centers and smart inventory-allocation technology. The system, which is powered by artificial intelligence (AI), helps determine the closest fulfillment center and optimal level of inventory at each location to help ensure both fast and low-cost delivery. By offering a solution that not only lowers delivery costs but accelerates shipments, Shopify is providing services that are typically reserved for larger, more established merchants -- and making its services stickier in the process. 2. Shopify Plus gets a makeover Advertisement After initially focusing on small- and medium-sized merchants, Shopify realized that some of its more established sellers were outgrowing its services. The company developed its Shopify Plus platform to cater to the unique needs of enterprise level e-commerce merchants, who can operate dozens of stores across a multitude of geographies. Shopify has overhauled its Shopify Plus platform to offer a centralized view that aggregates data from multiple locations. The system also allows enhanced user control and permissions for businesses with multiple users, while allowing them to add new stores to the system quickly and easily. The company also expanded the capability of Shopify Flow, an integration tool that helps simplify workflows by connecting applications and automating repetitive tasks. The more robust Shopify Plus platform will be available later this year. Enterprise is a fast-growing opportunity for the company. In the first quarter, Shopify Plus merchants contributed 26% of the company's monthly recurring revenue, up from 22% in the prior-year quarter, and now accounts for 8% of Shopify's subscription-solutions revenue. 3. Next-gen POS software The merchant of today exists across a variety of sales platforms, selling in both brick-and-mortar and online stores. In order to cater to the needs of both facets of a growing business, Shopify is adding to the existing capabilities of its point-of-sale (POS) software. The latest iteration is designed to simplify the checkout experience by "creating new customer profiles, sorting collection lists, finding top products, and checking out." The system also allows store managers to set individual permissions for store employees, giving each a unique login and level of access that can be accessed from any store during any shift. The system can also be customized to integrate with customer loyalty and rewards programs and promotions. 4. Increasingly global capabilities Merchants that deal with international and cross border sales face a host of unique challenges, including language and currency issues. Shopify has been making significant investments in recent months to localize its platform in a variety of global markets. That trend continued this week, with the addition of 11 new languages to the Shopify platform -- on top of the six that were added last year. The platform also permits international merchants to sell products in multiple currencies while getting paid in the currency of their choosing. The system automatically updates product prices based on current exchange rates so customers get the most up-to-date information. Shopify is also providing a Translations feature that can be used on buyer-facing content, product descriptions, and blog posts. 5. Customer-engagement tools The ability to offer a customized experience to shoppers is one of the hallmarks of e-commerce, and this fact hasn't been lost on Shopify. The company introduced tools that allow merchants to customize the look and feel of any page in their online store quickly and easily, without having to rewrite the computer code. In addition to these improved editing tools, Shopify is adding new, more robust customer-engagement features, like the ability to display products using video, 3D, and augmented reality, all within the Shopify platform. Investor takeaway E-commerce is the wave of the future, and businesses that don't adopt and embrace this reality will surely be left behind. Shopify's bread and butter is providing merchants with the tools they need to succeed. Each of the announcements highlighted above shows the lengths to which Shopify is going to empower their merchants and help them to prosper. In the end, it will be Shopify -- and its investors -- that will reap the rewards. 10 stocks we like better than ShopifyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

# World Productivity Day: Benefits of AI for productivity are “second to none”

Today is World Productivity Day, a day for businesses to rethink their strategies for boosting productivity. According to the Office for National Statistics,workers’ productivity was lower over the past decade than at any time in the 20th Century, with productivity continuing to fall in the last quarter of 2018. However, combined with this, a recent report from the Centre for Labour and Social Studies found that almost half of UK workers have noticed an increase in stress and workload in the past 12 months. This suggests that long hours and wage stagnation have had a negative impact on productivity, indicating an urgent need for change. The answer to this may lie with technology, specifically Artificial Intelligence. Despite widespread reporting that AI poses a threat to human workers, research by PWC suggests that in reality only 3% of jobs will be at risk due to automation by the early 2020s. The acceleration of AI adoption is instead predicted to have a significant impact on productivity. With tools such as attended and unattended robotic process automation, natural language processing, and virtual assistants, the amount of time human workers spend on mundane or repetitive tasks will be significantly reduced. According to Forbes, automation could handle up to 45% of repetitive work, giving workers more time for higher value tasks such as problem-solving, training and creative thinking. Furthermore, by streamlining and automating some of their daily tasks, there is less of a chance employees will become overworked, with research from the University of Warwick showing that happy employees are 12% more productive. This World Productivity day, two experts weigh in on what this could mean for business. “The benefits to productivity are second to none”  John Gikopolous, head of AI & automation at Infosys Consulting, believes that organisations must embrace the benefits of AI and humans working together to see real returns when it comes to productivity:  “‘AI will take our jobs and render us useless’. This is a statement that in recent years has dominated the media landscape. But is this statement entirely true or will AI and automation actually help individuals and organisations exceed their productivity in the long run? “There are mixed feelings towards new technologies that have the knowledge that even the most intelligent humans don’t possess. However, that’s not to say that there’s no benefits to be had from humans and robots working together. All organisations are striving towards the same end goal – to be as efficient and productive as possible so that they can succeed. This is exactly what AI and automation has the potential to do. “Research has shown that by 2035, AI will have the power to increase productivity by 40%. The manufacturing industry in particular will see their results flourish with the introduction of these new technologies, with certain tasks becoming automated to increase efficiency. “In essence, AI has the opportunity to replace those jobs that involve particularly repetitive and mundane tasks, to allow workers to focus on more important and creative tasks. The benefits to productivity are second to none and AI has the potential to improve employees’ working lives.   3 Things That Will Change the World Today  “This World Productivity Day, we ought to be celebrating the technological progress we have made to date. AI and automation technologies are changing our lives inside and outside of the workplace. Forget the stereotype that AI is stealing our jobs. It’s not. What it is doing, is facilitating a more productive workforce that can truly benefit organisations in the long term. “Organisations need to embrace this mentality and ensure that technologies work in unison with their employees to facilitate a more productive and efficient workforce.” “AI is by no means a replacement for humans”  Sandra Schroeter, International Head, Customer Engagement Technologies at LogMeIn believes that AI complements the work of humans and makes them more productive:  “Technology is permeating every area of business today and customer experience is not immune to this. Specifically, AI, chatbots and NLP are helping companies in virtually every industry to provide better customer service at scale without having to rely on the contact centre to resolve every customer query manually. “That being said, AI is by no means a replacement for humans. Instead, it complements the work of human agents and enables them to be more productive. By using NLP and machine learning to suggest appropriate responses to customer enquiries, AI helps to manage customer interactions and drives improved operational efficiency, faster resolutions and more personalised customer engagement. This is a win win for businesses and customers alike. “This World Productivity Day, companies should look to leverage the capabilities of AI to increase employee productivity and to enable consumer satisfaction in turn giving them a competitive advantage.”<|im_end|>

# 89-year-old Paradise Valley woman hikes Mount Kilimanjaro for second time

PARADISE VALLEY, AZ (3TV/CBS 5) -- About 5 years ago, we caught up with 85-year old Anne Lorimor who hiked Mount Kilimanjaro. She lives in Paradise Valley, and she wanted to make history with that hike by becoming the oldest woman to ever reach the summit. Someone else from Russia broke that record. So now she's doing it again. She's hoping her hike gets attention and will help raise money for her non-profit that benefits underprivileged kids. Four years later, she is doing it again! [VIDEO: 89-year-old hiker set to beat record] Lorimor is about to set off on her second hike up the tallest stand-alone mountain in the world. She plans to be even more ready for this hike than she was for the past. "It was the most challenging thing at that point. Some of it was not difficult, but the day I got a touch of flu it was very, very difficult. I am going to be more prepared and I have a personal trainer and he works me pretty hard," Lorimor says. Lorimor is hoping the Guinness Book will officially rank her as the oldest person to ever make that hike. Three generations of her family have helped kids in need, her father owned an orphanage years ago. Lorimor keeps the tradition going with her organization called, Creating Exciting Futures. "I don't, at my age I don't try to make any speed records. I'm gonna do the age record and that's what I try to do is get up and get down. I want all the time to steer people back to the foundation and the kids cause that's what it's all about," she said. "I like climbing. I don't care if I get records or not. [READ MORE: CBS 5 This Morning stories] "It is my mission in life. I do want to help kids because if they don't know what their chances are, they will just sit down and not do anything that's a shame." Lorimor is planning to take a group of kids on a trip later this year. She's trying to raise money on this hike to do that. For more on Lorimor's non-profit for kids, click HERE.

# Next 50 is Taking Care of Our Elders - OUT FRONT

There may be nothing else on this earth that queer people resist more than growing old. And while clichés about gay men lying about their age and queer folks living forever can be funny, there’s a very real reason we’re afraid of aging. There aren’t always people there to take care of us. That’s where the Next 50 Initiative comes in.  “I’m particularly interested in helping LGBTQ individuals, and particularly the older population, just given the disparities they face,” said Carey Candrian, PhD, co-director of the Next 50 Initiative with Dr. Hillary Lum. “Older LGBTQ individuals are more likely to go back into the closet, and many are living in poverty and less likely to have kids, be married, or have caregivers. They are more likely to live alone and be lonely.”  The Next 50 Initiative is a grant initiative that helps with advanced care planning for LGBTQ and other hi-risk elders. The Denver Hospice and the CU School of Medicine are working together under this umbrella to try and make sure queer elders have the help they need.  They realize that there is distress within the elder queer community that there are not enough people who can help, and there is a reluctance to seek care because of stigma. Advanced care planning is essentially the process of making sure that things are in place for folks once they reach their later years. It’s not just for older folks, either. Advanced care planning can be important for young and middle-aged people so they can plan what life will be like later on.  Still, that’s easier said than done for a lot of folks in the community who don’t have the resources to be taken care of. So, Next 50 wants to use the young folks of today to help care of our queer elders.   “We are using an untapped resource in the community—volunteers, particularly more from LGBT community organizations,” Candrian added. “They go through a 16-hour free training, certification, get skills in advanced care planning, get skills in communication. Then, the goal is for them to go back out and talk to their peers and their friends and to sort of start the change on a community level,” Candrian said.  Ultimately, the idea is to get everyone who is a part of the queer community to come in and get trained, not only those who want to work in elder care or volunteer. That way, people will be aware of what they could face in their own life and will be able to help and support those around them.  While this is in no way supposed to replace healthcare professionals, sometimes having someone you can relate to can be the most important form of support out there. The main focus of the people who go through this training is not to be able to provide nursing care to elders, but to essentially act as mentors to older folks. That can help with big decisions and life planning and provide companionship.  “I think the lack of family has been the most glaring barrier to LGBTQ senior care,” Candrian said. “There is an assumption that everyone just sort of has this incredible network of people.   “Some people don’t have anyone there to be their medical decision maker, and that’s heartbreaking. No one should have to go through this alone.” To learn more about Next 50, visit them online at next50initiative.org.<|im_end|>

# Colorado learned the danger of glamorizing shooters. Does lionizing student heroes also carry risks?

Colorado learned the danger of glamorizing shooters. Does lionizing student heroes also carry risks? The Colorado Sun The youngest students learn to help their teacher barricade a door. Middle-schoolers work on how to join forces to pin a gunman to the ground during a struggle, to spread their body weight, like wrestlers, across an arm or a leg. And in high school, training in how to fight off an active shooter includes a lesson in firearms — how to recognize an opportunity to get away or fight back when a shooter is reloading his weapon. The student trainings, including one planned near Denver this summer, mark a new era in school safety, a shift beyond the “shelter-in-place” and even the “hide, run, fight” drills that are common at schools across the country. The message — reinforced in the past month by the national praise for two students killed while taking down school shooters — is that sometimes kids have to take matters into their own hands. But while young victims are publicly celebrated, child psychologists are raising alarms. They caution against glamorizing young people’s deaths like cartoon superheroes and worry about the risks involved in training students to confront a shooter. Still, the trainings are taking hold.

# Lakeway to offer more medical services

With an 11-building complex approved for a 6-acre tract at 3503 Wild Cherry Drive, Lakeway City Council paved the way Monday for the expansion of the city’s medical area. The property is adjacent to the Baylor Scott & White Lakeway hospital, and council members unanimously approved a special use permit to allow medical uses within its current C-1, office/retail, zoning category. Local ordinances require a special use permit on a site if a medical use is located less than 300 feet from a residential area or school. A site development plan for 11 office buildings — Cherry Peak Office Park — was originally approved by the city in March of 2017, and a building permit issued in January. The office buildings are currently under construction, Building and Development Services Director Charlotte Hodges said. Todd Fletcher, a partner in the project’s development firm Cherry Peak Ltd., provided a letter stating many of the buildings are under contract, with the first user being an ophthalmologist who currently has a Lakeway office. The permit is needed because other potential medical uses can fit into the overall project including doctors, dentists, physical rehabilitation offices and veterinarians, he said. Hodges responded to council’s concerns that a veterinary clinic would be allowed in the project “but not outside kennels” or outside structures without another approved special use permit. Mayor Sandy Cox questioned what type of rehabilitation facilities could be anticipated by the complex, with Hodges confirming a physical rehabilitation facility is the type of rehabilitation project intended by the ordinance. She said a separate permit would be needed for other types of rehabilitation facilities. City code counts convalescent homes, assisted-living residences and addiction rehabilitation facilities among the type of projects requiring an additional permit. Also at the meeting: • The council tabled to its meeting next week a replat of a waterfront 5.78-acre tract in Lakeway Highlands that was intended to accurately match the platting document with the lot lines of the site’s development on Casasanta Trail. The project includes an already-constructed tram and marina. Resident David Cummings questioned whether this tract could become the Rough Hollow waterfront park allegedly promised by the same developers but never created, asking the city’s permit department to cease the replatting and permitting of this section’s waterfront homes. Led by council member Gretchen Vance, the council considered that the tram and marina may not have been included in the original approved plans of the planned unit development, with the marina permitted by the Lower Colorado River Authority but not the city as required by local code. The developer was not present at the meeting and, with council member Steve Smith not in approval, the measure was delayed by a 5-1 vote. • Officials from the Texas Department of Transportation and Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization provided updates to the area’s RM 620 plan that improves the roadway from Hudson Bend Road to Texas 71 by modifying the four-lane rural roadway into a six-lane divided route, with the project’s expected start date of late 2022. TxDOT is funding the project, and Lakeway is contributing $5 million, funds that Mayor Sandy Cox said would be put to a bond vote by the city’s residents. • Council reviewed the administrative approval of a final plat for an independent senior living community on just over 9 acres at 5201 Bee Creek Road at Texas 71 in the Serene Hills subdivision. The Revel-Lakeway project will include 164 independent living units and access to the property will be off Bee Creek Road. • Lakeway Police Chief Todd Radford reported the perimeter fence at the new police facility has been modified to remove spikes at the top that City Council banned from use in early-2019 for safety concerns. Although the police fence was grandfathered and exempt from the recent ruling, the spikes were removed June 1 with the contributions of the Lakeway Police Foundation and resident Tom Kilgore. • The council recognized the Lake Travis Lions Club, Jonathan White Construction and the Lakeway Police Foundation for contributing almost $23,000 of materials and labor to improve the department’s outdated and tattered animal shelter. • The council recognized the efforts of the Lakeway Police Foundation and H-E-B for contributing heart healthy meals to the department’s staff three times a week since June 2018. The cost of this program has been $1,518 monthly and the Foundation contributed $16,435 toward its success. Council unanimously approved the program’s extension. • City Manager Steve Jones said reflectors have been added the edge of a curved section of Serene Hills Drive to make the roadway safer in wet or inclement weather.<|im_end|>

# Judgment (PS4)

Judgment (PS4) - Review Evan Norris , posted 1 hour ago / 526 Views If you adore Ace Attorney and Yakuza, there might not be a more perfect game on the planet than Judgment. A spin-off of the open-world crime saga Yakuza, Judgment merges legal and investigative elements with the showy third-person brawling, dramatic storytelling, and immersive virtual tourism typical of the series. Some of the game's novelties—crime scene investigation, tailing missions, and dialog decisions—aren't especially engaging, but the package overall is a smart mix of action and adventure mechanics that's worthy of the Yakuza franchise.  As with Yakuza, storytelling is a highlight in Judgment. The plot follows Takayuki Yagami, a young lawyer who three years ago made a name for himself when he secured a rare acquittal for a murder suspect. Tak's career went into a nosedive shortly thereafter, however, when the defendant was charged and convicted with another violent murder. In the present, Tak, now a private investigator, finds himself on the hunt for a serial killer who is gouging out victims’ eyes in the red-light district of Kamurocho, Tokyo—familiar stomping grounds for Yakuza veterans.  Featuring expert voice acting, high production values, and lots of plot twists and turns, the story in Judgment is excellent. The cast of characters is even more impressive. Stand-outs include Kazuya Ayabe, a pragmatic dirty cop; Masaharu Kaito, an ex-yakuza with a steely facade and a surprisingly soft interior (one of the game's funniest moments comes when Kaito impersonates "Captain Cop" for a young fan); and the no-nonsense lawyer Saori Shirosaki, who has an insatiable sweet tooth and steals every scene she's in. The game's protagonist, Tak, is also compelling. For any Yakuza fans apprehensive about the absence of series hero Kazuma Kiryu, worry not. Tak, with his skinny jeans, biker jacket, and persistent determination, is a reliable substitute.  Overall, there is more character development, wit, and thematic depth in Judgment's 40 GB than in the majority of Hollywood blockbusters. If you are a fan of cinematic storytelling, murder mysteries, and/or Japanese culture, this is an ideal title.  The only downside: the length and frequency of cut-scenes can prove exhausting. Judgment offers the player an extraordinary amount of freedom at times, but when the narrative takes over you'll find yourself sitting and staring for long stretches. There are gameplay segments, in fact, that exist only to walk Tak from one cut-scene to the next.  Judgment is at its best when it moves away from scripted storytelling toward unfettered open-world exploration. Kamurocho, the principal setting of the game, is an urban playground filled with hundreds of things to do and see in the downtime between story missions. Tak can walk the city streets, try blackjack in an underground casino, play Fighting Vipers and Virtua Fighter 5 in a Sega arcade, dine out at restaurants, and chat with dozens of quest-giving citizens.  It doesn't end there. In Kamurocho, Tak will participate in airborne drone races, play a virtual reality board game, develop bonds with friends, play mahjong, sell items at pawn shops, and pick fights with roving street gangs. In addition, players have the ability to retire to Tak's office, where they can decorate and play a pinball machine. There's even a complete rail shooter campaign called "Kamuro of the Dead", available in one of the local arcades. As a sandbox experience, Judgment scores its highest marks.  Interspersed among aimless open-air segments are story and side missions, which focus on either classic Yakuza gameplay—e.g., street fights—or case investigation mechanics. Combat is as fun and flashy as ever, thanks to interactive objects, EX actions, and Tak's ability to swap between two fighting styles in the heat of battle. Crane style, with its sweeping fast attacks, is ideal for encounters with a large group of enemies; Tiger style is designed to deliver powerful strokes against a single, formidable opponent.  Less successful are the game's investigation mechanics. These include first-person crime scene surveys, which are sometimes boring pixel hunts; tailing missions, which are difficult to make entertaining even for the most talented developers; and summation sequences, where Tak must present evidence in the correct order—although there doesn't seem to be a penalty for failure, outside of a few lost experience points. Judgment deserves kudos for branching out mechanically with these new features, but also a couple of demerits for embracing some tedious gameplay.  The game also embraces some lovely visuals and special effects. Judgment is a great-looking PS4 title, with realistic character models, atmospheric lighting—the bright lights and dank alleys of Kamurocho make it feel alive and dangerous—and some stunning battle animations and visual flourishes. The smoky neon auras that envelop bosses are particularly stunning. Judgment also offers a full English dub, a first for the Yakuza series in over a decade, although purists may wish to opt for the original Japanese audio.  By combining the legal proceedings of Ace Attorney with the visceral combat and open-world hijinks of Yakuza, developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has turned in a new, but familiar property. Some of the novel gameplay elements like tailing missions and crime scene investigation are dull, but outstanding production values, flashy fighting, and a stellar urban sandbox make this legal drama a hit.

# FEATURE-With drones, AI and e-vehicles, China crafts green-tech megalopolis

By Marianne Bray HONG KONG, June 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Entrepreneur Tony Verb is on a mission to promote technology that can help make cities greener and smarter in China's Greater Bay Area, now being shaped as a low-carbon megalopolis. Hong Kong-based Verb, co-founder of investment firm GreaterBay Ventures & Advisors, plans to back urban tech businesses working on autonomous e-vehicles, flying taxis, artificial intelligence, robotics and clean energy. Verb is betting on China’s master plan to develop the Pearl River Delta into a sustainable innovation hub, which he believes will serve as "a great case study" for the world's cities. In February, Beijing announced it would foster links between nine cities in Guangdong and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau to forge the world’s biggest urban area with 70 million people. Under the Greater Bay Area (GBA) plan, each city has a different role, but the blueprint is centred on developing the delta in a high-tech way that also conserves its ecology. The strategy comes as China exits an era of breakneck growth when planning and finance for infrastructure were overlooked, Witman Hung, Hong Kong deputy to China's 13th National People’s Congress, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Travel Sentry founder John Vermilye remembered visiting factories in the delta in 2003, and seeing plastic pellets flowing into sewage drains and workers in flip-flops carrying pots of molten zinc from the furnace to moulding machines. “Sixteen years ago, we were telling businesses how to be sustainable and what changes they needed to make - but now they're getting this from the government directly,” said Vermilye, whose firm develops luggage security standards. Marred by smog, dirty soil and contaminated water, China - the world’s biggest energy user and greenhouse gas emitter - decided development had to respect and protect its environment. Leaders introduced “ecological civilisation” as a constitutional goal in 2012, said Christine Loh, chief development strategist at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). In 2014, Beijing declared war on pollution, introducing environmental laws and inspectors who swept through businesses. It then launched “Made in China 2025”, cementing a move away from the world’s factory floor to innovation-led growth. E-VEHICLES While Hong Kongers may be divided about closer political and legal ties with the mainland, the GBA is already an economic powerhouse attracting many startups. Its GDP is $1.6 trillion, similar to Tokyo Bay, and leaders want it to rival Silicon Valley. Shenzhen is home to tech heavyweights like Tencent and Huawei. It is also one of China’s three sustainable development zones, tasked with serving as a technology testbed for green solutions in sectors like waste and environmental restoration. The coastal megacity of 12.5 million helps the bay lead the way in electric vehicles and low-carbon transit. “All over the delta, you are seeing the gradual rollout of e-buses, e-vans and e-taxis,” said Loh. That came after Beijing started giving subsidies for electric transport, buoying home-grown e-vehicle maker BYD. Shenzhen now has 16,000 e-buses plying its streets, a world first, and by the end of 2018, it also had 20,000 e-taxis, Xinhua reported. Meanwhile, electric trains whizz around the delta. Hong Kong’s MTR alone moves 5.76 million passengers each weekday in a city of 7.4 million. This year authorities linked up Hong Kong to the mainland’s express rail link, slashing commuting times. With Beijing’s target to cut energy consumed per GDP unit by 3% this year, bay officials are also pushing green construction and the use of data and technology, deputy Hung said. “Every time there’s a new building, every time a power plant is being built or modified, you have to meet such rules,” he added. Siu Hung Chan, managing director of power company CLP’s China business, said data analytics and machine-learning are fostering smart cities in the delta. Shenzhen uses street cameras and apps to direct drivers to carparks and uncongested roads, while Cisco is building a “model smart city” in Guangzhou’s Panyu district. RIVER CHIEFS Still, the bay’s history as the world’s workshop and site of three of its ten busiest ports means the challenge is big. “While the industries are gone, the rivers are still there and the pollution is still there," said Hung. The GBA sits in the Indo-Burma hotspot, one of the world’s most biodiverse areas, but also one of its most threatened. When Shenzhen’s mayor took office in 2017, his first priority was taking care of the black, smelly water, Hung said. Now there is a “river chief system”, led by the mayor who is personally in charge of several rivers, while almost 100 officials have been assigned to look after others. “It becomes their personal responsibility to make sure the river becomes clean again,” said Hung. With the delta spanning three administrative areas, there have been cross-border efforts to clean up the air, but it often falls short of World Health Organization standards. Another part of the GBA plan is to protect wetlands, forests, coastlines and marine ecosystems. A group of Hongkongers, led by local foundation AquaMeridian and the Canadian International School, have nominated the city’s southern waters to be protected under a conservation campaign run by non-profit Mission Blue. SNIFFING SHIPS As the planet warms, many studies deem the region at high risk of floods and landslides, but there are also opportunities to plan better for those threats, said Loh of HKUST. With the population seen growing to 100 million by 2030, according to Savills, the delta is testing “sponge cities” where landscapes and underground tanks absorb and store rainwater. Weather chiefs from the three administrations are also exploring how AI and data can improve forecasts, while AI is being used to predict landslides. HKUST, meanwhile, uses drones to sniff emissions from ships to see if they have switched to cleaner fuel. Loh is hopeful of a greener future for the GBA, noting the low-carbon development plan enjoys top-level political support, with Hong Kong playing a key role in financing green projects. “China is speed-fighting pollution," she said.

# Los Angeles Rams lost the Super Bowl but their first-ever male cheerleaders created history

As Tom Brady and the New England Patriots rewrote the record book with a 13-3 Super Bowl triumph over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday, Rams cheerleaders Quinton Peron and Napoleon Jinnies made some NFL history of their own. Jinnies and Peron are part of a 40-member Rams cheerleader squad – the fir and now, the first to perform at a Super Bowl. st male dance-style cheerleaders in the history of the league and now, the first to perform at a Super Bowl. While they’ve endured some hostility from some fans who believe NFL cheerleading should remain the preserve of women, Peron told the Los Angeles Times that the support of their families, a majority of fans and their fellow cheerleaders had carried them through. “Whatever has been out there we’ve been able to take it, because we know who has our backs,” Peron, 26, told the newspaper. “Our family has our backs, our girls have our backs and the city of LA, they’ve got us.” The Rams didn’t go into the season seeking to add men to the cheer squad. Peron, a professional dancer and choreographer got the idea to try out when he was watching a Los Angeles Lakers Basketball Game, where the Laker Girls cheerleaders entertain during pauses in the games. “I’m looking down at the Laker Girls and I thought, ‘Why can’t I do this?’” he said. Jinnies, a professional dancer and makeup artist, had a similar thought, when talking to fellow dancers. “We were just casually talking about auditions and I thought, ‘Why not just show up?’”<|im_end|>

# Experimental Action Releases Details on 2019 Festival | Glasstire

Experimental Action (ExA), Houston’s biennial performance art event, has announced additional details for its 2019 festival. ExA’s strength is that while it brings in national and international artists, the festival’s organizers make an apparent effort to look for local talent in their own backyards: myriad Houston artists are represented in the festival’s lineup, along with other artists from San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas. Also, since ExA announced a partial festival lineup in December of 2018, two other names have been added to the list: Chile and Argentina-based artist Gustavo Solar, and Columbus, Ohio-based artist Robert Ladislas Derr.

# Firefighters and veteran's charity team up for better mental health | CBC News

Firefighters and veteran's charity team up for better mental health Langford Fire Rescue can now access Wounded Warriors Canada support programs First responders in Langford, B.C. will now have access to extended mental health support programs thanks to a new partnership with Wounded Warriors Canada. The organization, a national mental health charity that provides programs for first responders, veterans and their families, has partnered with the Langford Fire Rescue and will now share those services with the more than 60 Langford volunteer and career firefighters. Langford Fire Chief Chris Aubrey told CBC On The Island guest host Khalil Akhtar the new programs include couples counselling and operational stress programs to help build up mental resiliency for young firefighters just starting on the job. "This is another mechanism for us to be able to protect them mentally and emotionally through the different incidents they attend," said Aubrey. Unique programs According to Aubrey, Langford Fire Rescue members already had access to peer support and family assistance programs, but the unique programs Wounded Warriors Canada offers will be a huge new advantage for them. Scott Maxwell, executive director of Wounded Warriors Canada, said in a statement the organization is looking forward to working with their new partner. "This partnership recognizes that no single organization can do it all when it comes to mental health support," said Maxwell. Great to kickoff 2019 with our first BC Partnership Agreement. We look forward to working with <a href="https://twitter.com/LangfordFire?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LangfordFire</a>, and the City of Langford, to support their firefighters and their families. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/InThisTogether?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#InThisTogether</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mentalhealth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mentalhealth</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/partnership?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#partnership</a> <a href="https://t.co/L60CMGT7Q4">pic.twitter.com/L60CMGT7Q4</a> &mdash;@WoundWarriorCA Aubrey said a relationship began between his crews and Wounded Warrior a few years ago when the charity enlisted the help of Langford Fire Rescue crews to help escort runners during a fundraising race. Langford Fire Rescue will continue to support Wounded Warrior events and fundraising efforts by providing man power and spreading awareness as their part of the partnership deal. 'My hope is that other departments across the country sign on with Wounded Warriors to signify that whether you're military or a first responder there is help for you," said Aubrey.

# This Hybrid Coffee Cup and Water Bottle Lets You Drink Both Beverages from One Lid

A new Kickstarter wants to make it easier to carry both water and coffee at the same time.  Kickstarter campaigns tend to be at their best when they leave you thinking, “Oh, that’s interesting.” If you’re left thinking “Wowee zowee!” it might be too good to be true. Meanwhile, if your instinct is “Haven’t I seen that before?” then you might be able to get a similar item without the wait. That’s why a new campaign caught my attention: It’s a simple, practical, interesting idea that I (at least) had never seen before: a bottle that allows you to drink both hot coffee and cold water.  Launched this week, H2Joe bills itself as “the first bottle that holds hot coffee and cold water at the same time and allows you to drink both from the same lid.” Despite instant visions of going to chug water, accidentally opening the wrong part of the lid, and scalding my entire mouth in the process, the idea makes sense: Water and coffee are the two drinks people are probably most likely to be carrying around at any given time. Oh, and just to set the record straight, they’ve got that “drinking from the wrong spout” problem worked out: Just like most water bottles, the water side of the lid is a twist off cap, whereas the coffee side flips up for sipping — tapping into your psychological instincts for both beverages.  So how does it work? The bottom stainless steel container screws off to hold 12-ounces of hot coffee (and keep it hot for up to six-hours). The plastic, insulated, top half of the bottle holds 12-ounces of water (and keeps it cold for up to eight hours), but also has a tube running along the inside to let the coffee pour through from below. Frankly, the main quibble I’m sensing is that it seems like a long way for your coffee to travel to get to your mouth, which might be annoying, but admittedly, I haven’t tried the product, so I can’t say.  According to the campaign, the idea for H2Joe came from Dorothy Moody, and with the help of her husband Brett and his friend John — who “share more than 50 years of product and marketing success, having sold $1B+ in products at wholesale for various companies” — they’ve gotten the concept off the ground.  The Kickstarter community certainly is interested: H2Joe has already raised nearly $80,000, almost four times the original goal. If you pledge within the next four days, you can still reserve one of these bottles for $39 — said to be $20 off the expected retail price. Of course, as with any crowdfunding campaign, there are risks and potential hiccups, but H2Joe says it plans to get bottles to backers by October.<|im_end|>

# Six Nations: Eddie Jones aims to spoil Welsh party

England coach Eddie Jones takes his side to Cardiff for a potential Six Nations title-decider against Wales having promised to “spoil the party” at the Principality Stadium.  England and Wales are the only two unbeaten sides left in this season’s Championship after the opening two rounds.  Wales are on an 11-match unbeaten run, with just one more win required to break their all-time record set from 1907-1910.  They were last crowned Six Nations champions in 2013, when they thrashed England 30-3 on the final day of the tournament that season.  England, however, are bidding for a third Six Nations title under Jones, who has won all four of his matches against Wales since taking over as Red Rose boss after the 2015 World Cup — when Warren Gatland’s side helped knock arch-rivals England out in the first round with a pool-stage victory at Twickenham.  This weekend’s match is set to be Gatland’s last Six Nations game in charge of Wales against England as the New Zealander is standing down from his post after this year’s World Cup in Japan.   “As we know, the week has all been about Wales,” Jones told reporters at England’s training base in Bagshot, southwest of London, after naming his team on Thursday.  “The dragons are flying, aren’t they? So it should be interesting.” Eddie Jones Asked if he still believed Gatland’s current side were the “greatest Wales team ever” Jones, not averse to trying to unsettle his opponents ahead of a game, replied:   “I don’t think I said that, I’m just repeating what the popular view is.  “They are up to win 12 games in a row, it’s Warren’s last game as Wales coach (against England in the Six Nations) before he takes over somewhere else so it’s a big week for them, a lot of expectation.”  “That expectation can either be some wind in their sails or it can be a ball and chain, so we’ll find out on Saturday,” the Australian added.  “They have a team they are so proud of and a coach they are so proud of. It’s his last game. We are excited to be a part of that and spoil the party.” Eddie Jones But no one inside the Wales camp or even among their most loyal supporters has seriously suggested the present side are better than the 2008 and 2012 Grand Slam-winning teams, let alone any of the celebrated Welsh XVs of the 1970s.   “The only quotes I can see about this being the greatest Wales team are from Eddie Jones,” said Gatland.  “It hasn’t come from anyone else, so I wouldn’t be disrespectful enough to say this was the greatest Welsh team ever. It’s a long way off being the greatest Welsh team ever,” the former Ireland coach added. “He’s the one talking us up.” Eddie Jones Gatland, who coached players from both countries when they were all involved in the British and Irish Lions side that drew a three-Test series in New Zealand two years ago, said: “There is a huge amount (of) respect between the players from both teams. With the Lions, the Welsh boys and English boys got on really well.”  There is also a link between the backroom staffs, with Gatland and England assistant coach John Mitchell sharing a house when they played together for Waikato in New Zealand.   “I’ve already had a text from John Mitchell (England assistant coach) and Eddie saying they are looking forward to catching up after the game and having a drink,” explained Gatland.  “This is all fun and games now, but afterwards it’s about catching up with some mates and enjoying the occasion.” Warren Gatland © Agence France-Presse<|im_end|>

# Charles Van Doren, Contestant in 1950s ‘Quiz Show’ Scandal, Dead at 93

Charles Van Doren, the 1950s quiz show contestant who infamously cheated his way to stardom by using answers he received in advance, has died at the age of 93. His son John told The New York Times that Van Doren died from natural causes at a retirement community in Cornwall, Connecticut, where he lived for several years.  Van Doren was born February 12th, 1925 in New York City, the son of Pulitzer Prize-awarded poet/critic Mark Van Doren and novelist Dorothy Van Doren. He attended both Cambridge University and Columbia University; he was teaching English at the latter college when he auditioned to appear on the NBC quiz show, Twenty-One, in 1957.   The decorated, 31-year-old professor appeared on the program for 14 weeks — from November 28th, 1956 to March 11th, 1957 — answering varied questions about history, medicine and geography, among other subjects. His winning streak, which earned him $128,000, made him a national star (including a Time cover) and helped catapult the show to massive ratings. After his final appearance, he signed a three-year contract with NBC, which included spots on The Today Show.   But, despite the network’s statements to the contrary, rumors swirled that his appearance had been fixed. On November 2nd, 1959, he finally admitted to congressional investigators that he’d been supplied the questions and answers in advance — even coached to add drama to his performances. He pleaded guilty to second-degree perjury but served no jail time.  The disgraced star subsequently lost his Columbia job and took on a pseudonym as a writer-editor for Encyclopedia Brittanica. In 2008, he detailed the complicated circumstances of his quiz ordeal in a massive New Yorker piece.  Ralph Fiennes played Van Doren in Quiz Show, Robert Redford’s Oscar-nominated 1994 film about the scandal.<|im_end|>

# What do Ikea, the airport and Telus World of Science have in common? | CBC News

What do Ikea, the airport and Telus World of Science have in common? They’re just a few of the 'special' spots you can vote during advance polling until Saturday April 16 is still days away but election fever is in full swing, with thousands of people taking advantage of this year's expanded advance vote, which has brought polling stations to where the people are. Advance polls opened Tuesday and most will remain open through through Saturday. By Wednesday evening, 276,000 Albertans had already voted — 140,000 on Tuesday, and 136,000 on Wednesday. "I think it has something to do with the novelty that [Albertans] can vote anywhere now," Drew Westwater, Elections Alberta deputy chief electoral officer, said about the brisk attendance. This year's advance polling stations have spread to 100 unconventional voting spaces across the province, including airports, storefronts, hospitals, hotels and a science centre, to name a few. "Not everyone is at home in their own electoral division all the time. They may live in Calgary but work in Edmonton. This way you have the opportunity to go to any location in the province," Westwater said. New "vote anywhere" legislation was added after the 2015 election to allow for the flexibility. "We go where the people are and try to make it as accessible as possible for them," Westwater said. There was an advanced polling station 5 steps from my office! Voted already. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/abvote?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#abvote</a> &mdash;@craigpearce5 The 87 returning officers across the province suggested the location of new "special polls" based on where people in each of their communities would be most likely to gather. Some locations will appeal to those who love shopping — malls around the province have advance polling including West Edmonton Mall and Bonnie Doon Shopping Centre in Edmonton, and Calgary's Southcentre and Westbrook malls. On April 13, Ikea shoppers can pick up a ballot, a Billy bookcase and perhaps even some famous Swedish meatballs. Voting on the go Heading out of town is no excuse for not voting, with advance voting available at airports in Edmonton and Calgary. The advance poll at the Calgary Airport on the arrivals level at Door 12; in Edmonton, the spot to go is the observation deck on the third level in the Reyjavik Room. Most post-secondary campuses, including Mount Royal University, NAIT, SAIT, Concordia University and the University of Alberta, have advance voting stations set up for students, instructors and community members. NAIT student Harry Park took advantage of the polling station set up in the student study lounge on Wednesday. He said he wishes Elections Alberta had put this into place "a long time ago." "So many people don't vote without opportunities like this," Park said. Matthew Cunningham, another student at NAIT, agreed the new polling stations are convenient. "This is super-handy for college students. It's mid April, which is cram time," he said. There are also advance polling booths available at golf courses, seniors centres, homeless shelters and a food bank. While some advance polling locations are in obvious spots, others are a bit more mysterious. One on the Elections Alberta website is labelled "Across from the Post Office" in Blackfalds, Alta. "I think the changes added to the advanced polling system are really enticing people to go out and vote. But I think beyond the changes it is quite evident that in this election, there are many people that are committed to making making their voice heard," said Chaldeans Mensah, political scientist at MacEwan University. While some may argue that you can't read too much into advanced polling numbers, Mensah said the feeling with this election is different. "I think it is a very competitive election. We are moving to a de facto two-party system here. It's a very polarized electorate and there are strong forces on both sides wanting to make an impact," Mensah said. On the flip side, Mount Royal University communications professor David Taras said the early surge in votes cast isn't necessarily an indication of anything. There is still room for a change of opinion amongst Albertans or a major event that could sway people around election day, he said. "What it could mean is that political parties have been very good at identifying their voters .. and getting them to the polls. "The best insurance for political parties is to make sure that they vote early so that you don't stretch your resources on the last day," Taras said. Four of the 266 locations are not barrier-free. Westwater said that is because many communities across Alberta don't have accessible locations to use. "We didn't want that to be a barrier to everyone getting an opportunity to vote," Westwater said. Westwater noted that all regular advance polling stations are barrier-free, the four that aren't are all part of the new "special polls" Elections Alberta implemented this year. Sweet incentives If you're in Calgary, you may even be able to snag a sweet treat when you visit the polls. A group dubbed Democracy Donuts raised over $2,500 to serve voters desserts this week. You can get a doughnut along with your ballot at Vivo for Healthier Generations, 11950 Country Village Link N.E., on Thursday, SAIT's Stan Grad Centre on Friday, and the Pineridge Community Centre on Saturday. VOTE COMPASS | Find out how your views on campaign issues line up with the platforms of Alberta's major parties Voting hours vary from location to location, with most advance polling locations open from 9 a.m. until 8 p.m. through Saturday. Up-to-date stations and dates are available here. If you're unable to vote at an advance poll or on election day, you can request a special ballot in person from your division's returning office. Here's a guide on how to do that.<|im_end|>

# Bus crashes on foggy Virginia highway, killing 2 and injuring 3

March 19 (UPI) -- Two people are dead and three others are being treated for injuries after a bus carrying 57 people crashed on a foggy Interstate 95 in Virginia.  The Tao's Travel Inc. bus overturned while taking an exit ramp on Interstate 95 in Prince George County south of Richmond. It flipped off the left side of the ramp at about 5:22 a.m. The bus was going from Florida to New York. There were 56 passengers on the bus and a driver. One of the victims died at the scene, the other at the hospital.  Family members can call the Prince George County Emergency Services Center at 804-733-2659 for information about the bus. A Family Reunification Center is being established at the Prince George County Central Wellness Center at 11023 Prince George Drive in Disputanta.  There were several other crashes Tuesday morning in that area because of thick fog that reduced visibility to less than a quarter mile. The temperature at the time was 28 degrees, cold enough for the fog to freeze and create a thin layer of ice on road surfaces.  The cause of the crash is under investigation.<|im_end|>

# Alcohol crack down at Harris County bars leads to 59 charges, closures

A year-long drunken driving crackdown sparked by the 2018 death of a woman and her 9-month-old baby has landed dozens of arrests and the suspension of several Harris County night clubs linked to traffic-related fatalities and alcohol violations, according to authorities.  Members of the Vehicular Crimes After-Hours Task Force announced Thursday that 59 criminal charges have been lodged against a number of people, bartenders and business owners included, for “putting profits over safety” since the arrest of an underage woman accused of killing the mother and child in a drunken crash.  The woman, Veronica Rivas, who was 20 at the time of arrest, is out on bond on charges of intoxicated manslaughter with a vehicle.  “This tragedy was the jumping off point for it, the first time the task force was able to show what it could do,” said Sean Teare, head of the Harris County District Attorney’s Office Vehicular Crimes Unit.  “We found where she had been drinking, we found out who had served her alcohol and who had purchased that alcohol for her,” Teare said.  The investigation resulted in charges against a bartender at Crescent City Connection Sports & Oyster Bar, near Clear Lake, who pleaded no contest in September for selling alcohol to Rivas — a minor — without checking her identification. Two men, including the bar owner’s son, were also charged with knowingly purchasing and providing alcohol to her and a 17-year-old friend.  The investigations into intoxicated manslaughter cases, like the one aimed at Rivas, has also led to civil action against bars.  The first of five injunctions was filed against the Houston restaurant Bombshells along the Gulf Freeway in June after four people were arrested for driving while intoxicated from bar. A fifth driver was arrested for intoxication assault of a Houston Police Department officer while leaving the bar.  Chuck Cornelius, a district attorney’s investigator, said Bombshells complied with the injunction.  “They stepped up to the plate and provided a number of corrective activities in their location,” Cornelius said during a press conference.  The next bar, Fiesta Latina, along Highway 249, was served with an injunction in August after garnering several complaints dating back to 2008, including liquor sales after closing and contributing to the death of at least one intoxicated patron while crossing the highway.  “The owner surrendered the permit in the middle of court. They have been shut down,” Cornelius said.  The incidents, as detailed in court records, include shootings, stabbings and prostitution. Among them was a drunken patron who dialed 911 at 5:30 a.m. with loud music pounding in the background, suggesting the bar was still open. The patron told Harris County Sheriff’s Office deputies the owners of a taco stand at the bar wanted to kill him. Read Full Article “The patron, who appeared to be intoxicated, stated he had an issue with tacos that he did not want to pay for and believed the taco stand owners had advised individuals to kill him,” court documents read.  El Condor Pool Hall, at 9714 Veterans Memorial Drive, was another establishment that was shuttered because of the task force investigation. The bar owner and 13 patrons were arrested in September on drug-related charges after a months-long investigation into narcotics and possible human trafficking, according to authorities.  Latin Palace and JT’s Sports Bar were also closed, authorities said.  The task force also included the Harris County Sheriff’s Office, the Houston Police Department, Harris County Fire Marshal Office and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.  Teare said it could take another year to determine if the task force has led to a decrease in intoxicated manslaughter charges.  nicole.hensley@chron.com<|im_end|>

# Dominican Republic resort questions U.S. woman's assault story, says she demanded $2.2 million

(CBS News) -- A Dominican Republic resort has responded after a Delaware woman shared her story of being savagely attacked while vacationing at the Majestic Elegance Punta Cana Hotel, CBS Philadelphia reports. Tammy Lawrence-Daley, of Wilmington, was on vacation with her husband when says she went downstairs on the property to buy a snack. That's when Lawrence-Daley says a man wearing a resort maintenance hat and shirt strangled and beat her. Lawrence-Daley suffered a broken nose, fractured eye socket, nerve damage throughout her head and her entire mouth had to be sewn back together. Her disappearance lasted eight hours and the whole while she was going in and out of consciousness. On Wednesday night, Majestic Resorts sent CBS Philadelphia a statement, saying that Lawrence-Daley received all necessary attention and care following the ordeal, and that she also demanded $2.2 in million compensation for the ordeal. The hotel says that Lawrence-Daley was found at 6:40 a.m. by a hotel employee. Authorities were notified and an ambulance was immediately called. Majestic Resorts says a hotel staff member stayed at the hospital with Lawrence-Daley and the resort paid for all of her hospital expenses. Majestic Resorts said Lawrence-Daley later demanded financial compensation, and after not receiving a response, she told her story, four months after the attack. The statement provided to Eyewitness News mentions, in part, "weak points" and "contradictions" in Lawrence-Daley's recalling of her attack. The statement reads. in part: After their investigation, authorities understand that the scenario is still unclear, and that there are weak points and unanswered questions to answer in this strange and unusual case. Some news media sources in the United States have reported on the story considering her accounts are true and definitive, instead of waiting for a final resolution of the case, that not only affects Majestic Resorts, but also tourism for the entire Dominican Republic. Majestic expresses to have no opinion on the hypothesis of some authorities involved in the investigation, who consider that the story of Mrs. Lawrence-Daley while she was in the hospital, at the hotel and during conversations with police and prosecutors, presents contradictions and confusing data, which make such authorities doubt of her testimony and believe that information on the case is being concealed by blaming a hotel employee. Majestic says they continue to cooperate with authorities as an investigation continues. Previously, police in the Dominican Republic said there were conflicting accounts of what happened. "There is a lot of conjecture about the case, a lot of information that doesn't match some of the statements," Police spokesman Col. Frank Durán said Friday. "We have to wait for the investigation to end."<|im_end|>

# WATCH | Armed men snatch briefcase from car in less than a minute

WATCH | Armed men snatch briefcase from car in less than a minute  It took less than a minute for two armed men to rob a man in a seemingly secure parking lot on Tuesday.  CCTV footage of the robbery, in Airport Industria, near Cape Town International Airport, was released on Twitter by BOSBEER Cape Town.  The footage shows a Mercedes driving into the parking lot of a factory as a white bakkie drives by. The bakkie stops and two armed men run on to the property while the man parks his car.  As employees in the parking lot flee, the criminals get the man out of his car and force him to open the boot. They snatch an item from the vehicle and run back to their bakkie.  According to BOSBEER Cape Town, the item taken from the car was a briefcase containing documents. No money was taken.<|im_end|>

# Barrow BOE approves ‘other’ funds budget, including buildings

he Barrow County Board of Education unanimously approved the “other” funds budget of about $62.9 million Tuesday, including spending about $23.5 million on buildings for the fiscal year 2020. 
The county is building its third high school adjacent to the Sims Academy on Austin Road. That building, for about 600 to 700 students, is expected to open next summer. 
The budget for the construction underway is about $16.4 million. That is phase I of the school and includes a “commons” area and a classroom building. 
Renovations at Yargo Elementary, Westside Middle and Apalachee High schools also are underway this summer. 
The “other” funds budget is for capital projects, debt service for current buildings, school nutrition of about $8 million; $3 million for Title I, mostly for at-risk and economically disadvantaged students; $2.4 million in federal money for special education and $2 million in state money for pre-kindergarten classes. 
The “other” funds also includes three other Title programs, vocational education, Jr. ROTC programs at both high schools, “homeless” students’ education and the enterprise fund for after- and pre-school programs. 
The board also approved a $60,000 contract for work at the Center for Innovative Teaching to Callaway Site Services of Bishop. It will include classrooms for robotics and maker’s space and a dance studio. Both are to accommodate expanding enrollment at the facility. 
The trim and entry to the building also will be painted. The money will be from special purpose local option sales tax V funds. 
For more on Tuesday's meeting, see the June 5 edition of the Barrow News-Journal.

# Are You Really Going to Grow a Horn From Slouching Over Your Smartphone?

If you love to complain about the kids these days and their newfangled devices, I’ve got the perfect thing for you: Phones are causing horns to grow on young people’s skulls.  At least that’s what one local outlet recently made of some findings by Australian researchers, who published a trio of papers between 2016 and 2018 describing growths of small bone spurs on the back of young people’s skulls. The research has been out for a while but has received a round of media attention after a BBC article published last week mentioned it as an example of how the human skeleton is still evolving.  These “bony projections” are also called enthesophytes, and they’re fairly common among older people, so they’re thought to develop over many years. But David Shahar and Mark Sayers describe finding growths in younger people as well, and they hypothesize the bad posture invited by cellphone use—craning your neck and slumping downward to peer into your hands—could contribute to these growths.  This is scientific evidence that our screens are hurting us! It’s literally causing our skeletons to change!  Hold your panic. First off, the horn idea doesn’t quite work here. Horns are usually at the top of the skull, not the base of the skull near the neck, which is where these growths have been found. But, of course, that doesn’t make for as catchy a headline or tweet.  It’s also worth looking twice at the research. In their first study, published in 2016, Shahar and Sayers describe the rarity of studies examining skull growths in young. They go on to study X-rays of people between 18 and 30, and were surprised to find that there were growths in 41 percent of their 1,200-person sample. But this doesn’t mean that what they found is necessarily a new phenomenon. There is no comparison point to what the prevalence rates were in the analog days of yore, so it’s entirely possible these growths are just more common than we previously thought, not that this generation is developing them at a higher rate.  Perhaps studies describing these growths are rare because bone spurs are largely harmless. That could explain why they’ve gone undetected for so long: Unless growths are causing problems, people rarely get X-rayed just to see whether they have weird bones. And it turns out that many of us do! “Bone spur” sounds alarming, because we like to think of our skeletons as fixed things. But any kind of repeated pressure or use can result in our body developing adaptations. For instance, women who wear high heels might develop bone spurs in the heel, and apparently 1 in 10 people has a heel spur.  It’s also premature to blame technology for this. Shahar and Sayers are quick to say this themselves: In a 2018 paper studying four teenage boys with these bone growths, the researchers conclude that the growths could be a result of “biomechanical stress” rather than genetics or local inflammation. The source of that stress, though, is not something they study. They note that the boys were X-rayed after their parents expressed concern about their posture, so it could just be that these kids had bad posture to begin with, screen use or not. But Shahar and Sayers still run with the smartphone hypothesis in all three of their papers, despite their admission that “we have no direct evidence.”  Their work notes many other potential causes of these spurs: general poor posture “while sitting, standing, or sleeping,” “bike riding using drop hand-bars,” or “sleeping supine with a high pillow.” The authors dismiss the latter two because they’re not new to society. But, again, there’s no definitive evidence that these spur growths are a new phenomenon, either. Maybe people who ride bikes with drop bars and prefer a high pillow are just prone to these spurs, and we’ve been living this way for generations with no serious consequences.  Even if these spurs are becoming more common, we don’t actually know why, though screen use would certainly be a tidy, convenient explanation. But a key piece of this puzzle that’s currently missing is what drives these growths, and without data linking X-rays and people’s habits, we simply don’t know. And that’s hard work to do. If we do suspect screen time is the culprit, the easiest method might be to X-ray people, ask about their daily screen use habits, and then observe their posture while looking at a phone. That would provide more convincing, although still not knockdown, evidence linking the growths to screen time specifically.  If you’ve got a spur: cool! Your body is doing what it’s best at: adapting to the stressors you put it through, whatever they may be. As long as it’s not bothering you, you’re fine, and you now have a built-in answer to those “share one interesting fact about yourself” warmup exercises we all dread.  And if you’re worried? The takeaways are the things you already know you should be doing but probably don’t: mind your posture and moderate your screen use. But that’s not terribly catchy, is it?<|im_end|>
