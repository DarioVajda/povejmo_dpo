They were elected to two-year terms in 2024; after the 2026 election, all future terms will be four years.\n\nClark was the only member of City Council to have reached the 25% threshold for election in the first round of voting.\n\n## 2024\n\nThis district's race in the 2024 Portland City Council election was notable for having the only change in the winner due to transfers performed under the single transferable vote system. Eli Arnold captured the third-most first preferences in the first round of tabulation, leading Eric Zimmerman by just over 100 votes. However, Zimmerman received enough transfers (due voters' second- through sixth-place rankings on ballots that were tramsferred from eliminated candidates) to surpass Arnold's final vote total by just under 800 votes in further rounds of tabulation, and beat him out to the district's third seat.\n\n## References\n\nGovernment of Portland, Oregon", 'role': 'user'}]

However, Zimmerman received enough transfers (due voters' second- through sixth-place rankings on ballots that were tramsferred from eliminated candidates) to surpass Arnold's final vote total by just under 800 votes in further rounds of tabulation, and beat him out to the district's third seat.\n\n## References\n\nGovernment of Portland, Oregon<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", prompt_token_ids=[2, 2, 106, 1645, 108, 3035, 96640, 219276, 68015, 9561, 67213, 3400, 509, 8494, 593, 154549, 40456, 1925, 235265, 108, 235345, 29954, 235303, 235256, 235248, 235310, 489, 3922, 7050, 9220, 591, 75848, 235275, 109, 96371, 235303, 235256, 235248, 235310, 489, 3922, 7050, 9220, 603, 974, 576, 2785, 3103, 235290, 3688, 22081, 182690, 2149, 1461, 577, 29954, 3922, 7050, 575, 29954, 235269, 22011, 235265, 714, 9220, 7744, 832, 576, 29954, 9764, 576, 573, 124105, 67312, 6701, 591, 157792, 235269, 50908, 235269, 578, 4316, 187051, 1834, 235275, 685, 1578, 685, 476, 2301, 2713, 611, 573, 9110, 2857, 3359, 2149, 59261, 235265, 109, 651, 9220, 7744, 573, 59261, 576, 70506, 44326, 235269, 31427, 14679, 235269, 14135, 171334, 235269, 29318, 5878, 862, 591, 18892, 29885, 235260, 30019, 823, 27251, 4681, 235269, 93199, 4493, 235269, 58459, 235269, 5571, 182113, 235269, 8201, 50908, 235269, 12533, 4422, 235269, 76759, 52744, 235269, 12202, 51319, 591, 18892, 46234, 21648, 823, 21648, 18835, 235269, 9300, 2043, 235269, 136541, 235269, 7041, 39819, 235269, 50435, 4493, 235269, 159213, 235269, 25823, 4422, 235269, 112532, 956, 11550, 591, 18892, 112532, 956, 11550, 20041, 823, 42164, 8867, 591, 18892, 225739, 235269, 23474, 9300, 235269, 578, 573, 100475, 41967, 8867, 823, 42164, 44326, 235269, 42164, 17494, 235269, 9057, 12803, 140203, 235269, 36548, 8867, 235269, 32428, 235269, 45979, 4493, 235290, 4678, 1445, 235269, 4316, 7446, 2117, 734, 235269, 4316, 29954, 591, 18892, 140870, 235269, 84335, 235269, 218889, 9300, 235269, 4406, 43452, 1197, 235269, 578, 573, 44131, 55549, 578, 4316, 146374, 22492, 823, 50908, 21648, 235269, 181952, 235290, 45344, 55152, 235269, 578, 4589, 29954, 4422, 591, 24175, 45798, 9300, 846, 109, 41110, 235248, 235310, 603, 7094, 12754, 611, 29954, 3922, 7050, 731, 55729, 19114, 235269, 75941, 6724, 235269, 578, 19288, 113810, 235265, 2365, 1049, 17710, 577, 1378, 235290, 4085, 4563, 575, 235248, 235284, 235276, 235284, 235310, 235289, 1452, 573, 235248, 235284, 235276, 235284, 235318, 11621, 235269, 832, 3936, 4563, 877, 614, 2785, 1658, 235265, 109, 66934, 729, 573, 1297, 4757, 576, 3922, 7050, 577, 791, 8951, 573, 235248, 235284, 235308, 235358, 18573, 604, 11621, 575, 573, 1370, 5094, 576, 25059, 235265, 109, 1620, 235248, 235284, 235276, 235284, 235310, 109, 1596, 9220, 235303, 235256, 7925, 575, 573, 235248, 235284, 235276, 235284, 235310, 29954, 3922, 7050, 11621, 729, 30361, 604, 3372, 573, 1297, 2669, 575, 573, 16995, 3402, 577, 32363, 8261, 1362, 573, 3821, 164986, 8744, 1812, 235265, 24206, 31427, 23535, 573, 4906, 235290, 3422, 1370, 22733, 575, 573, 1370, 5094, 576, 203221, 235269, 8133, 19288, 113810, 731, 1317, 1163, 235248, 235274, 235276, 235276, 7093, 235265, 4560, 235269, 113810, 4956, 3594, 32363, 591, 22003, 28242, 235303, 2257, 235290, 1593, 27063, 235290, 3531, 54435, 611, 86943, 674, 1049, 234638, 14015, 774, 35867, 17725, 235275, 577, 103229, 31427, 235303, 235256, 2048, 8744, 3051, 731, 1317, 1362, 235248, 235321, 235276, 235276, 7093, 575, 4024, 28243, 576, 203221, 235269, 578, 10270, 1357, 921, 577, 573, 9220, 235303, 235256, 4906, 10250, 235265, 109, 1620, 24287, 109, 37223, 576, 29954, 235269, 22011, 107, 108, 106, 2516, 108, 1], encoder_prompt=None, encoder_prompt_token_ids=None, prompt_logprobs=None, outputs=[CompletionOutput(index=0, text="# James Murray (politician)\n\nJames Murray (1834 – 22 December 1904) was an Irish-born Australian politician.\n\nHe was born in County Tipperary to farmer James Murray and Margaret O'Brien.

He was born in County Tipperary to farmer James Murray and Margaret O'Brien. The family arrived in Sydney in 1841 and settled at the Hunter River. Murray was educated at Morpeth, and in 1852 he became a schoolteacher at Widden. From 1854 to 1857 he was a public servant in the Treasury, and from 1857 to 1863 he was a clerk at the Customs Department. On 21 November 1855 he married Ann Kirby, with whom he would have six children. In 1863 he became a commission agent, and in 1873 he was appointed to the Newcastle Harbour Trust.

In 1874 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Northumberland. He was a supporter of Henry Parkes, and served as Minister for Justice from January to April 1877 and again from November 1877 to December 1878, Minister for Public Instruction from January to April 1877 and again from November 1877 to December 1878, Minister for Works from January to April 1877 and again from November 1877 to December 1878, Minister for Public Works from January to April 1877 and from November 1877 to December 1878, and Colonial Secretary from January to April 1877.

He was defeated in 1878, but was elected for Newcastle in 1882 and served until his defeat in 1885. He was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1895, serving until his death at his home in Woollahra in 1904. His son, James, was also a member of parliament.

[{'content': 'Prevedi naslednje angleško besedilo v slovenščino.\n# Epoxy molding compounds\n\nEpoxy Molding Compounds (EMC) represent a category of advanced materials utilized in electronic packaging, primarily consisting of epoxy resin, phenolic compounds, curing agent, fillers, and various additives. To safeguard electronic components against mechanical damage, contamination, and moisture, mass production techniques such as injection molding or transfer molding are typically employed to encapsulate these components within the EMC. Upon curing, the epoxy resin develops a three-dimensional network structure that exhibits superior mechanical properties as well as resistance to heat and moisture, rendering it highly effective in protecting devices from environmental factors.\n\n## History\n\nThe development of semiconductor technology commenced in the 1940s with the introduction of germanium diodes, subsequently progressing with the invention of transistors. This innovation facilitated the miniaturization of circuits and reduced power consumption, thereby catalyzing the emergence of the contemporary computer era.

To safeguard electronic components against mechanical damage, contamination, and moisture, mass production techniques such as injection molding or transfer molding are typically employed to encapsulate these components within the EMC. Upon curing, the epoxy resin develops a three-dimensional network structure that exhibits superior mechanical properties as well as resistance to heat and moisture, rendering it highly effective in protecting devices from environmental factors.\n\n## History\n\nThe development of semiconductor technology commenced in the 1940s with the introduction of germanium diodes, subsequently progressing with the invention of transistors. This innovation facilitated the miniaturization of circuits and reduced power consumption, thereby catalyzing the emergence of the contemporary computer era. The packaging employed for these semiconductor devices serves to provide protection and enables their connection to printed circuit boards. Initially, the packaging technology utilized for diodes and transistors involved canned sealing. However, with advancements in passivation technology, plastic packaging methods were introduced.

representative rower. He is an Olympic champion, a three-time World champion and an Australian national champion.\n\n## Club and state rowing\n\nHall was raised in the Melbourne suburb of Black Rock. His senior rowing was from the Melbourne University Boat Club.\n\nHall's state representative debut for Victoria was in the 1994 men's eight contesting the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. He rowed in six consecutive Victorian King's Cup eights from 1994 to 1999.\n\n## International representative rowing\n\nHall's first Australian representative selection was for the 1993 World Rowing Championships in Racice where he rowed in the Australian men's eight to a fourth placing. The following year in 1994, he was selected in the Australian men's eight to compete at the World Rowing Championships in Indianapolis. That crew won Australia's first ever World Championship in men's eight rowing.\n\nIn 1995 Hall was elevated to the Australian men's sweep-oared coxless four with his Victorian teammates Robert Jahrling, Mike McKay and Kerry Hore. That crew won their heat, placed third in the semi-final and then won the gold medal in the final at the 1995 World Rowing Championships in Tampere. In 1996 at the World Rowing Championships in Motherwell, Scotland, the Australian sweep-oared coxless four of Hall, McKay, Jahrling and Stephen Hawkins won their heat and semi-final and then took the gold medal in the final.\n\nAt the 1996 Atlanta Olympics the Australian men's eight, with Hall at stroke, won the gold medal. They won their heat and semi-final and took the gold in the final.\n\nIn 1997 Hall was again selected in the Australian men's sweep-oared coxless four. They placed fourth in the final at the World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette. Hall's final Australian representative appearance was in 1998 when he was selected in the Australian eight to race at the World Rowing Championships in Cologne. That crew placed fourth in the final.\n\n## Coaching\n\nHall is a qualified sports scientist and has worked as a rowing coach. He has coached at the Melbourne University Boat Club and was the women's head coach at the Mercantile Rowing Club between 2007 and 2010. He was the Australian women's sweep coach for the 2010 World Rowing Championships and the Australian women's head coach for the 2011 World Rowing Championships.\n\n## Post rowing\n\nHall has a Bachelor of Medical Science and a Master of Sports Science from the University of Melbourne. He has worked as a sports scientist and lecturer at the Australian Institute of Sport, and as a consultant for the Australian Olympic Committee and the Australian Institute of Sport.\n\n##

Translation: # Jeff Hall (rower)

Jeff Hall (born 14 June 1969) is a former Australian representative rower. He is an Olympic champion, a three-time World champion and an Australian national champion.

## Club and state rowing

Hall was raised in the Melbourne suburb of Black Rock. His senior rowing was from the Melbourne University Boat Club.

Hall's state representative debut for Victoria was in the 1994 men's eight contesting the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. He rowed in six consecutive Victorian King's Cup eights from 1994 to 1999.

## International representative rowing

Hall's first Australian representative selection was for the 1993 World Rowing Championships in Racice where he rowed in the Australian men's eight to a fourth placing. The following year in 1994, he was selected in the Australian men's eight to compete at the World Rowing Championships in Indianapolis. That crew won Australia's first ever World Championship in men's eight rowing.

In 1995 Hall was elevated to the Australian men's sweep-oared coxless four with his Victorian teammates Robert Jahrling, Mike McKay and Kerry Hore. That crew won their heat, placed third in the semi-final and then won the gold medal in the final at the 1995 World Rowing Championships in Tampere. In 1996 at the World Rowing Championships in Motherwell, Scotland, the Australian sweep-oared coxless four of Hall, McKay, Jahrling and Stephen Hawkins won their heat and semi-final and then took the gold medal in the final.

At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics the Australian men's eight, with Hall at stroke, won the gold medal. They won their heat and semi-final and took the gold in the final.

In 1997 Hall was again selected in the Australian men's sweep-oared coxless four. They placed fourth in the final at the World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette. Hall's final Australian representative appearance was in 1998 when he was selected in the Australian eight to race at the World Rowing Championships in Cologne. That crew placed fourth in the final.

## Coaching

Hall is a qualified sports scientist and has worked as a rowing coach. He has coached at the Melbourne University Boat Club and was the women's head coach at the Mercantile Rowing Club between 2007 and 2010. He was the Australian women's sweep coach for the 2010 World Rowing Championships and the Australian women's head coach for the 2011 World Rowing Championships.

## Post rowing

Hall has a Bachelor of Medical Science and a Master of Sports Science from the University of Melbourne. He has worked as a sports scientist and lecturer at the Australian Institute of Sport, and as a consultant for the Australian Olympic Committee and the Australian Institute of Sport.

## Recognition

In 2015 Hall was inducted into the Victorian Honour Roll of Champion Women and Men.

[{'content': "Prevedi naslednje angleško besedilo v slovenščino.\n# Barry Dunaway\n\nBarry Dunaway is an American rock bassist, vocalist, and composer. His professional music career dates back to his early 1970s roles in groups Cheyenne and Bittersweet, and he performed with bands fronted by artists Pat Travers, Joe Lynn Turner, and Yngwie Malmsteen in the 1980s. Dunaway has played bass guitar in the band 38 Special since 2013.\n\n## Early life\n\nDunaway was born to James Melvin Dunaway and Irma May Provost, both of whom served in the United States Coast Guard. At the age of 15 Dunaway played with his brother Don Oja-Dunaway in the bands Cheyenne and Bittersweet, performing at local venues like Raven Gallery and Bistro. Dunaway and his brother Don eventually formed the band Chuffa with their sister Sharon on vocals and keyboards. Separately from his family, Dunaway played bass guitar in the Atlanta folk rock group Silverman at age 17.\n\n## 1970s\n\nIn 1974, Dunaway joined the Dawson Boys, a country rock music band based in Atlanta and fronted by Ed and Bob Dawson. Dunaway played bass guitar on the group’s 1976 album These Summer Nights. Writing for the Columbia Record, Pat Berman noted “folk, pop, blues and occasional jazz” influences in the songs on the effort. Dunaway also played with the Atlanta, Georgia rock group Magic Cat in the late 1970s.\n\n## 1980–1999\n\nIn 1980, Dunaway joined the Atlanta band Whiteface, replacing their previous bassist Kyle Henderson. He helped write some songs on their 1981 sophomore album Change of Face on Mercury Records. The same year, Dunaway recorded on Paul Davis’ album Cool Night on Arista Records before going on to perform with the band Bareback, also formed by Whiteface cofounder Doug Bare.\n\nDunaway was playing with Warner Records-signed band Riggs in 1982 when he and Riggs founder Jerry Riggs joined the band of rock musician Pat Travers. Dunaway contributed to Travers' 1984 album Hot Shot on Polydor Records as well as recording the band’s live album King Biscuit Flower Hour. During the mid-1980s, he also toured with Rainbow frontman Joe Lynn Turner in support of his 1985 album Rescue You, and he appeared alongside the rest of Turner’s band in the 1986 film Blue de Ville starring Jennifer Runyon.\n\nDunaway began playing with Yngwie Malmsteen in 1988. In conversation with Modern Drummer, drummer Anders Johansson credited Dunaway with helping steer Malmsteen’s classical-inspired style of heavy metal in a more practical direction for a rock band. Dunaway also recorded on numerous of Malmsteen’s albums, including Trial by Fire: Live in Leningrad in 1989, Facing the Animal in 1997, the 1998 effort Live!!, and 1999's Alchemy.\n\nDunaway joined the band Saraya as bassist for their album When The Blackbird Sings…, which came out on Polydor Records in 1991. He also performed and recorded with St. Augustine band Kingpins’ 1999 album Kings and Things.\n\n## 2000s\n\nIn 2004-06 Dunaway played bass for the band Survivor, contributing to their 2006 album Reach. Toward the end of the 2000s, he performed with the band Rock and Pop Masters, which included rotating libe up of one-time members of bands like Survivor, Elton John, Loverboy, John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band, Santana, Edgar Winter, Atlanta Rhythm Section, The Young Rascals, Deep Purple, Sass Jordan, Kool & The Gang, Hall & Oates and Orleans. Around the same time, he took the stage at Rock & Pop Masters, a band whose rotating lineup featured former Foreigner and Ambrosia members. He also played with the supergroup Voices of Classic Rock, featuring singers from Loverboy, Deep Purple, Toto and Jefferson Starship.\n\n## With 38 Special\n\nDunaway was recruited to play bass for the rock band 38 Special by founding member Don Barnes, who knew of Dunaway because of his involvement with Rock & Pop Masters. In conversation with former MTV video jockey Alan Hunter, Dunaway said that he initially filled in for Larry Junstrom while he had knee surgery in 2011 but then joined the band full time by 2013.\n\nBarnes has said that Dunaway has helped reinvigorate 38 Special, which has been active since 1977 despite lineup changes over the years. Dunaway still performs with the band as of 2025, making it his longest stint as bassist with a single group.\n\n## Discography\n\nDawson Boys\n\n* These Summer Nights (1976)\n\nBob Bakert\n\n* Bob Bakert (1977)\n\nPaul Davis\n\n* Cool Night (1981)\n\nEd Raetzloff\n\n* Drivin Wheels (1981)\n\nWhiteface\n\n* Change Of Face (1981)\n\nJames Anderson\n\n* Strangest Feeling (1982)\n\nMajor Lance\n\n* The Major's Back (1983)\n\nPat Travers\n\n* Hot Shot (1984)\n\n* School of Hard Knocks (1989)\n\n* King Biscuit Flower Hour (1997)\n\n* From the Front Row Live (2001)\n\n* Le Concert du Siecle (2001)\n\nYngwie J.

Dunaway contributed to Travers' 1984 album Hot Shot on Polydor Records as well as recording the band’s live album King Biscuit Flower Hour. During the mid-1980s, he also toured with Rainbow frontman Joe Lynn Turner in support of his 1985 album Rescue You, and he appeared alongside the rest of Turner’s band in the 1986 film Blue de Ville starring Jennifer Runyon.\n\nDunaway began playing with Yngwie Malmsteen in 1988. In conversation with Modern Drummer, drummer Anders Johansson credited Dunaway with helping steer Malmsteen’s classical-inspired style of heavy metal in a more practical direction for a rock band. Dunaway also recorded on numerous of Malmsteen’s albums, including Trial by Fire: Live in Leningrad in 1989, Facing the Animal in 1997, the 1998 effort Live!!, and 1999's Alchemy.\n\nDunaway joined the band Saraya as bassist for their album When The Blackbird Sings…, which came out on Polydor Records in 1991. He also performed and recorded with St. Augustine band Kingpins’ 1999 album Kings and Things.\n\n## 2000s\n\nIn 2004-06 Dunaway played bass for the band Survivor, contributing to their 2006 album Reach. Toward the end of the 2000s, he performed with the band Rock and Pop Masters, which included rotating libe up of one-time members of bands like Survivor, Elton John, Loverboy, John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band, Santana, Edgar Winter, Atlanta Rhythm Section, The Young Rascals, Deep Purple, Sass Jordan, Kool & The Gang, Hall & Oates and Orleans. Around the same time, he took the stage at Rock & Pop Masters, a band whose rotating lineup featured former Foreigner and Ambrosia members. He also played with the supergroup Voices of Classic Rock, featuring singers from Loverboy, Deep Purple, Toto and Jefferson Starship.\n\n## With 38 Special\n\nDunaway was recruited to play bass for the rock band 38 Special by founding member Don Barnes, who knew of Dunaway because of his involvement with Rock & Pop Masters. In conversation with former MTV video jockey Alan Hunter, Dunaway said that he initially filled in for Larry Junstrom while he had knee surgery in 2011 but then joined the band full time by 2013.\n\nBarnes has said that Dunaway has helped reinvigorate 38 Special, which has been active since 1977 despite lineup changes over the years. Dunaway still performs with the band as of 2025, making it his longest stint as bassist with a single group.\n\n## Discography\n\nDawson Boys\n\n* These Summer Nights (1976)\n\nBob Bakert\n\n* Bob Bakert (1977)\n\nPaul Davis\n\n* Cool Night (1981)\n\nEd Raetzloff\n\n* Drivin Wheels (1981)\n\nWhiteface\n\n* Change Of Face (1981)\n\nJames Anderson\n\n* Strangest Feeling (1982)\n\nMajor Lance\n\n* The Major's Back (1983)\n\nPat Travers\n\n* Hot Shot (1984)\n\n* School of Hard Knocks (1989)\n\n* King Biscuit Flower Hour (1997)\n\n* From the Front Row Live (2001)\n\n* Le Concert du Siecle (2001)\n\nYngwie J.

Both transit systems follow the right-of-way of a former tram line.\n\nFor vehicular traffic, the Calzada ends at its junction with Avenida Insurgentes in the borough of Tlalpan, where Federal Highways 95 and 95D continue south to Cuernavaca, Morelos, and beyond.\n\n## References\n\nStreets in Mexico City<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n', prompt_token_ids=[2, 2, 106, 1645, 108, 3035, 96640, 219276, 68015, 9561, 67213, 3400, 509, 8494, 593, 154549, 40456, 1925, 235265, 108, 235345, 2659, 36437, 581, 584, 30784, 3137, 109, 651, 2659, 36437, 581, 584, 30784, 3137, 9390, 34465, 1677, 576, 584, 30784, 3137, 1388, 603, 476, 3885, 7923, 235290, 36289, 14380, 23459, 575, 11198, 3922, 235265, 67674, 13525, 1706, 577, 9616, 573, 10534, 3413, 576, 584, 234158, 4798, 1033, 675, 573, 16539, 55430, 576, 8580, 7581, 51393, 235269, 575, 1277, 2835, 235290, 1311, 1736, 665, 45231, 573, 3413, 235303, 235256, 27255, 675, 573, 56988, 21925, 8432, 921, 774, 573, 3413, 577, 573, 6246, 576, 190416, 578, 85374, 1163, 476, 6075, 576, 235248, 235274, 235321, 5821, 235265, 109, 1620, 7874, 109, 34572, 576, 573, 4557, 1677, 6343, 2290, 573, 28568, 576, 44432, 1817, 3746, 1165, 235306, 36619, 235257, 575, 235248, 235274, 235310, 235304, 235284, 235265, 1165, 729, 974, 576, 2149, 674, 14952, 584, 234158, 4798, 1033, 675, 573, 55430, 576, 573, 16531, 31646, 235265, 878, 235248, 235274, 235308, 235274, 235315, 665, 729, 1671, 731, 63020, 4057, 32914, 2559, 143586, 577, 3343, 573, 3413, 235265, 109, 1620, 15833, 1744, 109, 12496, 235248, 235274, 235315, 235324, 235276, 235269, 2017, 235248, 235284, 576, 573, 11198, 3922, 27223, 10140, 1706, 573, 2659, 36437, 581, 584, 30784, 3137, 235303, 235256, 25744, 1452, 28720, 774, 1277, 30073, 4337, 696, 3250, 17606, 179319, 7148, 235265, 714, 1576, 220607, 540, 528, 2611, 9976, 11614, 1706, 573, 2659, 36437, 1452, 573, 30331, 235303, 235256, 131356, 696, 29747, 1114, 5890, 235265, 11553, 27005, 5188, 1611, 573, 1833, 235290, 559, 235290, 1677, 576, 476, 5730, 59149, 2017, 235265, 109, 1636, 131023, 9988, 235269, 573, 2659, 36437, 11338, 696, 1277, 36384, 675, 97934, 3204, 3457, 4475, 575, 573, 66447, 576, 584, 30784, 3137, 235269, 1570, 10109, 107587, 235248, 235315, 235308, 578, 235248, 235315, 235308, 235299, 5374, 8432, 577, 108126, 4849, 7019, 235269, 190416, 235269, 578, 7781, 235265, 109, 1620, 24287, 109, 212057, 575, 11198, 3922, 107, 108, 106, 2516, 108, 1], encoder_prompt=None, encoder_prompt_token_ids=None, prompt_logprobs=None, outputs=[CompletionOutput(index=0, text="# 1977–78 West Ham United F.C. season\n\nThe 1977–78 season was West Ham United's 59th season in the Football League and their 21st season in the First Division.\n\n## Season summary\n\nWest Ham had a good start to the season, and were top of the First Division table in early September.

[{'content': 'Prevedi naslednje angleško besedilo v slovenščino.\n# Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity\n\nExecutive Order "Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity", is an executive order signed by Donald Trump, the 47th President of the United States, on January 21, 2025. The executive order instructs federal departments not to issue contracts to private organizations that enforce diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) frameworks. The order does not affect state or lower jurisdiction level DEIA related government contracting practices. It specifically prevents affirmative action from being implemented by government contractors. The order also revoked certain parts of the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) order that was signed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, as well as other orders, in terms of federal contracting jobs. The order also requests federal agencies to start an investigation on 9 publicly traded companies.\n\nMany have claimed this as being anti-minority and would decrease the likelihood of individuals in minority groups from getting a job.\n\n## Provisions\n\n* Revocation of the following executive orders and presidential memorandum:\n\n* \n* Executive Order 11246\n\n* \n* Executive Order 12898\n\n* \n* Executive Order 13583\n\n* \n* Executive Order 13672\n\n* \n* Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016\n\n* Direct all executive departments and agencies to eliminate any discriminatory or unlawful preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidelines, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements\n\n* Instruct all agencies to uphold established civil rights laws and address unlawful diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices in the private sector.\n\n* The federal contracting process will be simplified to improve speed and efficiency, lower costs, and ensure that federal contractors and subcontractors adhere to civil rights laws.\n\n* The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs within the Department of Labor is directed to immediately stop:\n\n* \n* Promoting “diversity”\n\n* \n* Requiring federal contractors and subcontractors to implement “affirmative action” measures\n\n* \n* Permitting or encouraging federal contractors and subcontractors to adjust their workforce composition based on race, color, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or national origin\n\n* As outlined in Executive Order 13279 of December 12, 2002 (Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations), federal contractors and subcontractors must ensure that their employment, procurement, and contracting practices do not consider race, color, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or national origin in any manner that violates the nation’s civil rights laws.\n\n* The head of each agency must include the following provisions in every contract or grant award:\n\n* \n* A clause stating that the contractor\'s or grant recipient\'s full compliance with all applicable federal anti-discrimination laws is a key factor in the government’s payment decisions, as outlined in section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States Code; and\n\n* \n* A clause requiring the contractor or recipient to certify that it does not run any programs promoting DEI that conflict with any applicable federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\n* The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), with support from the Attorney General as needed, shall:\n\n* \n* Review and update all government-wide processes, directives, and guidance as necessary;\n\n* \n* Remove references to DEI and DEIA principles—regardless of how they are labeled—from federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance procedures to streamline these processes, enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure compliance with civil rights laws; and\n\n* \n* Eliminate all mandates, requirements, programs, or activities related to “diversity,” “equity,” “equitable decision-making,” “equitable deployment of financial and technical assistance,” “advancing equity,” and similar concepts, as appropriate.\n\n* The heads of all agencies, with support from the Attorney General, must take all necessary actions within their operations to promote in the private sector the principles of individual initiative, excellence, and hard work outlined in Section 2 of this order.\n\n* To assist in developing effective civil-rights policies for Trump adminstration, the Attorney General, within 120 days of this order, in consultation with relevant agency heads and in coordination with the Director of OMB, shall provide a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. This report will include recommendations for enforcing federal civil-rights laws and measures to encourage the private sector to eliminate illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI-related practices. The report will include a proposed strategic enforcement plan that identifies:\n\n* \n* Key sectors of concern under each agency’s jurisdiction;\n\n* \n* The most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners within each sector of concern;\n\n* \n* A detailed plan outlining specific steps to deter DEI programs or principles (whether labeled as “DEI” or otherwise) that involve illegal discrimination or preferences. As part of this plan, each agency will identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations targeting publicly traded corporations, large nonprofit organizations, foundations with assets of $500 million or more, state and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments exceeding $1 billion;\n\n* \n* Additional strategies to encourage the private sector to eliminate illegal DEI discrimination and preferences while ensuring compliance with federal civil-rights laws;\n\n* \n* Potential litigation for federal lawsuits, interventions, or statements of interest; and\n\n* \n* Possible regulatory actions and sub-regulatory guidance.\n\n* Within 120 days of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education shall jointly provide guidance to all state and local educational agencies that receive federal funding, as well as to all institutions of higher education that receive federal grants or participate in the federal student loan assistance program under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq. This guidance will outline the measures and practices necessary to comply with the decision in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023).\n\n* If any part of this order, or its application to a specific person or situation, is found to be invalid, the rest of the order and its application to other individuals or circumstances will remain unaffected.\n\n* This order does not apply to lawful employment or contracting preferences for U.S. armed forces veterans or individuals protected under the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107 et seq.\n\n* \n* This order does not restrict state or local governments, federal contractors, or federally funded state and local educational agencies or institutions of higher education from engaging in speech protected by the First Amendment.\n\n* \n* This order does not prohibit educators at federally funded institutions of higher education from advocating for, endorsing, or promoting the employment or contracting practices prohibited by this order, as part of broader academic instruction.\n\n* Nothing in this order shall be interpreted to:\n\n* \n* Limit or alter the authority legally granted to any executive department, agency, or their leadership; or\n\n* \n* Interfere with the responsibilities of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget regarding budgetary, administrative, or legislative matters.\n\n* \n* This order shall be carried out in accordance with applicable laws and is subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n* \n* This order does not create any rights or benefits, whether substantive or procedural, that are enforceable by any individual or entity against the United States, its departments, agencies, officers, employees, agents, or any other person.\n\n## Effects on current contracts\n\nThe order requires the government departments to review the hiring practices of businesses and organizations that have been contracted, as well as consider any remedies done after the signing of this order. Federal contractors were given 90 days from the signing of the order to stop DEIA practices. After the review, the departments are to determine whether to continue the contract with the current organization, give the contract to another party, or to cancel the contract.\n\nDue to this many organizations are worried if they might end up losing money from partially completed contracts, if the federal government were to rescind their contract. Because of this, many lawyers have suggested to contracted organizations to be in touch with a law-firm immediately.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of executive orders in the second presidency of Donald Trump\n\n## References\n\nExecutive orders of Donald Trump\nSecond presidency of Donald Trump', 'role': 'user'}]

The order also requests federal agencies to start an investigation on 9 publicly traded companies.\n\nMany have claimed this as being anti-minority and would decrease the likelihood of individuals in minority groups from getting a job.\n\n## Provisions\n\n* Revocation of the following executive orders and presidential memorandum:\n\n* \n* Executive Order 11246\n\n* \n* Executive Order 12898\n\n* \n* Executive Order 13583\n\n* \n* Executive Order 13672\n\n* \n* Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016\n\n* Direct all executive departments and agencies to eliminate any discriminatory or unlawful preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidelines, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements\n\n* Instruct all agencies to uphold established civil rights laws and address unlawful diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices in the private sector.\n\n* The federal contracting process will be simplified to improve speed and efficiency, lower costs, and ensure that federal contractors and subcontractors adhere to civil rights laws.\n\n* The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs within the Department of Labor is directed to immediately stop:\n\n* \n* Promoting “diversity”\n\n* \n* Requiring federal contractors and subcontractors to implement “affirmative action” measures\n\n* \n* Permitting or encouraging federal contractors and subcontractors to adjust their workforce composition based on race, color, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or national origin\n\n* As outlined in Executive Order 13279 of December 12, 2002 (Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations), federal contractors and subcontractors must ensure that their employment, procurement, and contracting practices do not consider race, color, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or national origin in any manner that violates the nation’s civil rights laws.\n\n* The head of each agency must include the following provisions in every contract or grant award:\n\n* \n* A clause stating that the contractor\'s or grant recipient\'s full compliance with all applicable federal anti-discrimination laws is a key factor in the government’s payment decisions, as outlined in section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States Code; and\n\n* \n* A clause requiring the contractor or recipient to certify that it does not run any programs promoting DEI that conflict with any applicable federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\n* The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), with support from the Attorney General as needed, shall:\n\n* \n* Review and update all government-wide processes, directives, and guidance as necessary;\n\n* \n* Remove references to DEI and DEIA principles—regardless of how they are labeled—from federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance procedures to streamline these processes, enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure compliance with civil rights laws; and\n\n* \n* Eliminate all mandates, requirements, programs, or activities related to “diversity,” “equity,” “equitable decision-making,” “equitable deployment of financial and technical assistance,” “advancing equity,” and similar concepts, as appropriate.\n\n* The heads of all agencies, with support from the Attorney General, must take all necessary actions within their operations to promote in the private sector the principles of individual initiative, excellence, and hard work outlined in Section 2 of this order.\n\n* To assist in developing effective civil-rights policies for Trump adminstration, the Attorney General, within 120 days of this order, in consultation with relevant agency heads and in coordination with the Director of OMB, shall provide a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. This report will include recommendations for enforcing federal civil-rights laws and measures to encourage the private sector to eliminate illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI-related practices. The report will include a proposed strategic enforcement plan that identifies:\n\n* \n* Key sectors of concern under each agency’s jurisdiction;\n\n* \n* The most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners within each sector of concern;\n\n* \n* A detailed plan outlining specific steps to deter DEI programs or principles (whether labeled as “DEI” or otherwise) that involve illegal discrimination or preferences. As part of this plan, each agency will identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations targeting publicly traded corporations, large nonprofit organizations, foundations with assets of $500 million or more, state and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments exceeding $1 billion;\n\n* \n* Additional strategies to encourage the private sector to eliminate illegal DEI discrimination and preferences while ensuring compliance with federal civil-rights laws;\n\n* \n* Potential litigation for federal lawsuits, interventions, or statements of interest; and\n\n* \n* Possible regulatory actions and sub-regulatory guidance.\n\n* Within 120 days of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education shall jointly provide guidance to all state and local educational agencies that receive federal funding, as well as to all institutions of higher education that receive federal grants or participate in the federal student loan assistance program under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq. This guidance will outline the measures and practices necessary to comply with the decision in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023).\n\n* If any part of this order, or its application to a specific person or situation, is found to be invalid, the rest of the order and its application to other individuals or circumstances will remain unaffected.\n\n* This order does not apply to lawful employment or contracting preferences for U.S. armed forces veterans or individuals protected under the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107 et seq.\n\n* \n* This order does not restrict state or local governments, federal contractors, or federally funded state and local educational agencies or institutions of higher education from engaging in speech protected by the First Amendment.\n\n* \n* This order does not prohibit educators at federally funded institutions of higher education from advocating for, endorsing, or promoting the employment or contracting practices prohibited by this order, as part of broader academic instruction.\n\n* Nothing in this order shall be interpreted to:\n\n* \n* Limit or alter the authority legally granted to any executive department, agency, or their leadership; or\n\n* \n* Interfere with the responsibilities of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget regarding budgetary, administrative, or legislative matters.\n\n* \n* This order shall be carried out in accordance with applicable laws and is subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n* \n* This order does not create any rights or benefits, whether substantive or procedural, that are enforceable by any individual or entity against the United States, its departments, agencies, officers, employees, agents, or any other person.\n\n## Effects on current contracts\n\nThe order requires the government departments to review the hiring practices of businesses and organizations that have been contracted, as well as consider any remedies done after the signing of this order. Federal contractors were given 90 days from the signing of the order to stop DEIA practices. After the review, the departments are to determine whether to continue the contract with the current organization, give the contract to another party, or to cancel the contract.\n\nDue to this many organizations are worried if they might end up losing money from partially completed contracts, if the federal government were to rescind their contract. Because of this, many lawyers have suggested to contracted organizations to be in touch with a law-firm immediately.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of executive orders in the second presidency of Donald

He is Professor Emeritus at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he previously held the Françoise Gilot-Salk chair. He was also an Adjunct Professor at the University of California San Diego.\n\nLemke has used molecular genetics to investigate the signaling networks that regulate immune system function and the development of the nervous system. His authored works have been published in academic journals, including Nature, Science, and Cell. He is the recipient of several awards, and was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2007.\n\n## Education\n\nLemke earned his S.B. in Life Sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a National Merit Scholar, in 1978. He was later awarded a Ph.D. in Biology from the California Institute of Technology in 1983, for work with Jeremy Brockes. He completed postdoctoral study in molecular biology with Richard Axel (Columbia University) in 1985.\n\n## Career\n\nLemke joined the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in 1985, eventually becoming Full Professor and Director of the Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory in 1995. He was awarded the Françoise Gilot-Salk Professorship in 2012, and was elected to three separate terms as Chair of the Salk Institute Faculty. In 2023, he was named Chief Science Officer of the Institute. He also held teaching appointments in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, beginning in 1988, eventually becoming Adjunct Professor in 1995. He founded Xetrios Therapeutics in 2009, which was later acquired by Kolltan Pharmaceuticals.\n\n## Research\n\nLemke's research spans discoveries in neurobiology and immunology, with a particular focus on receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their roles in cellular signaling, development, and immune regulation. His Ph.D. work identified glial growth factor (GGF), a protein critical for Schwann cell proliferation, elucidating its biochemical properties and distinguishing it from other growth factors. In his postdoctoral work with Axel, he cloned the Schwann cell gene that encodes myelin protein zero (MPZ), the major protein of the peripheral myelin sheath. He subsequently showed that MPZ is essential to the proper formation and function of this sheath. In his own lab at the Salk, he explored the intricate roles of RTKs in neural development, and in a single paper in 1991 provided the first identification of 11 of the 58 RTKs that are encoded in mammalian genomes. These novel RTKs included new members of the Eph, FGFR, and ErbB families, but also defined two entirely new RTK families. \n\nMuch of the subsequent work of the Lemke's lab has involved the genetic dissection, through the generation of mouse mutants, of the function of the novel RTKs identified in the 1991 paper. The most significant of these efforts address the ErbB, Eph, and, most notably, the TAM families. For example, he, along with his colleagues used loss-of-function mutants to show that ErbB4, a receptor for GGF and related ‘neuregulins’, is essential for cardiac muscle differentiation, Schwann cell survival, and neuronal axon guidance. The absence of ErbB4 in mice resulted in lethal cardiac and neural developmental defects, establishing its critical function in these processes. With respect to neural development, his combined gain- and loss-of-function studies of the EphA3, 4, 5, and 6 receptors explored sensory nervous system mapping. These experiments showed that topographic neural connections are guided by relative EphA receptor expression levels in the retina, which dictate neuronal targeting from the eye to the brain. \n\nA significant part of Lemke's studies relate to the 'TAM' receptors – Tyro3, Axl, and Mer. These receptors were initially 'orphans' – in that their activating ligands were unknown. Along with his collaborators, he established that these ligands are Protein S and Gas6, the former known for its role in blood coagulation. These findings revealed a link between protease cascades, cellular signaling, and tissue development, emphasizing their broader physiological relevance. A large body of subsequent work demonstrated that TAM receptors are primarily expressed by phagocytic cells, in macrophages of the immune system and elsewhere, where they play two essential and mechanistically related roles. The first of these is the recognition and clearance of dead (apoptotic) cells, many billions of which are generated each day in the human body. The second is the inhibition of the innate immune response in macrophages and dendritic cells of the immune system, where TAM receptors were shown to mitigate hyperactivation of these antigen-presenting cells, preventing autoimmunity. The receptors function as feedback inhibitors of inflammation, tightly regulating Toll-like receptor and cytokine signaling cascades. \n\nLemke's research on TAM receptor-ligand activity in the context of phagocytosis and inflammation has contributed to advancements in understanding human health.. He delineated the fundamental molecular determinants of TAM receptor-ligand-phospholipid interaction. In later studies, he revealed that Axl and Mer are expressed by microglia, the macrophages of the brain and spinal cord, where they regulate critical microglial activities in both normal tissue homeostasis and disease. He demonstrated that the TAMs and their ligands are central regulators of microglial recognition and engulfment of amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease.\n\n## Awards and honors\n \n\n* 1986-1990 – Pew Scholar Award, Pew Charitable Trusts\n\n* 1987-1989 – Basil O’Connor Starter Scholar Award, March of Dimes\n\n* 1990-1995 – Rita Allen Scholars Award, Rita Allen Foundation \n\n* 1994-2001 – Javits Neuroscience Investigator Award, NIH\n\n* 2001 – Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science\n\n## Selected articles\n\n* Gassmann, M., Casagranda, F., Orioli, D., Simon, H., Lai, C., Klein, R., & Lemke, G.

He is Professor Emeritus at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he previously held the Françoise Gilot-Salk chair. He was also an Adjunct Professor at the University of California San Diego.\n\nLemke has used molecular genetics to investigate the signaling networks that regulate immune system function and the development of the nervous system. His authored works have been published in academic journals, including Nature, Science, and Cell. He is the recipient of several awards, and was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2007.\n\n## Education\n\nLemke earned his S.B. in Life Sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a National Merit Scholar, in 1978. He was later awarded a Ph.D. in Biology from the California Institute of Technology in 1983, for work with Jeremy Brockes. He completed postdoctoral study in molecular biology with Richard Axel (Columbia University) in 1985.\n\n## Career\n\nLemke joined the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in 1985, eventually becoming Full Professor and Director of the Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory in 1995. He was awarded the Françoise Gilot-Salk Professorship in 2012, and was elected to three separate terms as Chair of the Salk Institute Faculty. In 2023, he was named Chief Science Officer of the Institute. He also held teaching appointments in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, beginning in 1988, eventually becoming Adjunct Professor in 1995. He founded Xetrios Therapeutics in 2009, which was later acquired by Kolltan Pharmaceuticals.\n\n## Research\n\nLemke's research spans discoveries in neurobiology and immunology, with a particular focus on receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their roles in cellular signaling, development, and immune regulation. His Ph.D. work identified glial growth factor (GGF), a protein critical for Schwann cell proliferation, elucidating its biochemical properties and distinguishing it from other growth factors. In his postdoctoral work with Axel, he cloned the Schwann cell gene that encodes myelin protein zero (MPZ), the major protein of the peripheral myelin sheath. He subsequently showed that MPZ is essential to the proper formation and function of this sheath. In his own lab at the Salk, he explored the intricate roles of RTKs in neural development, and in a single paper in 1991 provided the first identification of 11 of the 58 RTKs that are encoded in mammalian genomes. These novel RTKs included new members of the Eph, FGFR, and ErbB families, but also defined two entirely new RTK families. \n\nMuch of the subsequent work of the Lemke's lab has involved the genetic dissection, through the generation of mouse mutants, of the function of the novel RTKs identified in the 1991 paper. The most significant of these efforts address the ErbB, Eph, and, most notably, the TAM families. For example, he, along with his colleagues used loss-of-function mutants to show that ErbB4, a receptor for GGF and related ‘neuregulins’, is essential for cardiac muscle differentiation, Schwann cell survival, and neuronal axon guidance. The absence of ErbB4 in mice resulted in lethal cardiac and neural developmental defects, establishing its critical function in these processes. With respect to neural development, his combined gain- and loss-of-function studies of the EphA3, 4, 5, and 6 receptors explored sensory nervous system mapping. These experiments showed that topographic neural connections are guided by relative EphA receptor expression levels in the retina, which dictate neuronal targeting from the eye to the brain. \n\nA significant part of Lemke's studies relate to the 'TAM' receptors – Tyro3, Axl, and Mer. These receptors were initially 'orphans' – in that their activating ligands were unknown. Along with his collaborators, he established that these ligands are Protein S and Gas6, the former known for its role in blood coagulation. These findings revealed a link between protease cascades, cellular signaling, and tissue development, emphasizing their broader physiological relevance. A large body of subsequent work demonstrated that TAM receptors are primarily expressed by phagocytic cells, in macrophages of the immune system and elsewhere, where they play two essential and mechanistically related roles. The first of these is the recognition and clearance of dead (apoptotic) cells, many billions of which are generated each day in the human body. The second is the inhibition of the innate immune response in macrophages and dendritic cells of the immune system, where TAM receptors were shown to mitigate hyperactivation of these antigen-presenting cells, preventing autoimmunity. The receptors function as feedback inhibitors of inflammation, tightly regulating Toll-like receptor and cytokine signaling cascades. \n\nLemke's research on TAM receptor-ligand activity in the context of phagocytosis and inflammation has contributed to advancements in understanding human health..

Je profesor emeritus na Salkovem inštitutu za biološke študije, kjer je pred tem zasedal stolček Françoise Gilot-Salk. Bil je tudi gostujoči profesor na Univerzi Kalifornije, San Diego.\n\nLemke je uporabil molekularno genetiko za raziskovanje signalnih mrež, ki uravnavajo funkcijo imunskega sistema in razvoj živčnega sistema. Njegova avtorska dela so bila objavljena v znanstvenih revijah, kot so Nature, Science in Cell. Je prejemnik več nagrad in je bil leta 2007 izvoljen za člana Ameriškega združenja za napredovanje znanosti.\n\n## Izobraževanje\n\nLemke je leta 1978 na Tehnološkem inštitutu Massachusettsa pridobil diplomo iz življenjskih znanosti kot nacionalni štipendist. Leta 1983 je na Kalifornijskem tehnološkem inštitutu prejel doktorat iz biologije za delo z Jeremyjem Brockesom. Leta 1985 je opravil podiplomski študij molekularne biologije z Richardom Axelom (Univerza Columbia).\n\n## Kariera\n\nLeta 1985 se je pridružil Salkovemu inštitutu za biološke študije in leta 1995 postal polni profesor ter direktor laboratorija za molekularno nevrobiologijo. Leta 2012 je prejel stolček Françoise Gilot-Salk, leta 2023 pa je bil imenovan za glavnega znanstvenega uradnika inštituta. Leta 1988 se je pridružil Oddelku za nevroznanost na Medicinski fakulteti Univerze Kalifornije, San Diego, kjer je leta 1995 postal gostujoči profesor. Ustanovil je Xetrios Therapeutics leta 2009, ki ga je kasneje prevzela družba Kolltan Pharmaceuticals.\n\n## Raziskave\n\nLemke je raziskoval zapletene vloge receptorjev tirozin kinaz (RTK) v signalizaciji, razvoju in imunski regulaciji. V svojem doktorskem delu je identificiral glijalni rastni faktor (GGF), protein, ki je ključnega pomena za proliferacijo Schwannovih celic, in raziskal njegove biokemične lastnosti ter ga ločil od drugih rastnih faktorjev. V svojem podiplomskem delu z Axelom je kloniral gen Schwannovih celic, ki kodira protein nič (MPZ) nič, glavni protein periferne mielinske ovojnice. Pozneje je pokazal, da je MPZ bistven za pravilno oblikovanje in delovanje te ovojnice.\n\nV svojem laboratoriju na Salku je raziskoval zapletene vloge RTK v nevronskem razvoju in v enem članku iz leta 1991 prvi opisal 11 od 58 RTK, ki so kodirani v sesalskih genih. Ti novi RTK so vključevali nove člane družin Eph, FGF in ErbB, poleg tega pa so definirali tudi dve povsem novi družini RTK. Velik del nadaljnjega dela Lemkovega laboratorija je vključeval genetski razkos RTK, identificiranih v članku iz leta 1991, z uporabo mišjih mutant. Najpomembnejši med temi študijami so raziskovali družine ErbB, Eph in še posebej TAM.\n\nNa primer, on in njegovi sodelavci so z uporabo mutant z izgubo funkcije pokazali, da je ErbB4, receptor za GGF in sorodne nevreguline, bistvenega pomena za diferenciacijo srčne mišice, preživetje Schwannovih celic in nevronsko usmerjanje aksonov. Odsotnost ErbB4 pri miših je povzročila smrtonosne nevronske in kardiovaskularne razvojne napake, kar je potrdilo njegovo ključno vlogo v teh procesih. Glede nevronskega razvoja so njegove skupne študije z dobljeno in izgubljeno funkcijo EphA receptorjev 3, 4, 5 in 6 raziskale kartiranje senzoričnega živčnega sistema. Ti eksperimenti so pokazali, da topografske nevronske povezave iz očesa v možgane vodijo relativne ravni izražanja EphA receptorjev v mrežnici, ki določajo nevronsko ciljanje.\n\nPomemben del Lemkovih študij se nanaša na 'TAM' receptorje – Tyro3, Axl in Mer. Ti receptorji so bili sprva 'sirote' – njihovi aktivirajoči ligandi so bili neznani. S sodelavci je ugotovil, da so ti ligandi protein S in Gas6, pri čemer je prvi znan po svoji vlogi v koagulaciji krvi. Ti izsledki so razkrili povezavo med proteaznimi kaskadami, celično signalizacijo in tkivnim razvojem. Velik del nadaljnjega dela je pokazal, da so TAM receptorji predv#Greg Lemke\n\nGreg Erwin Lemke is an American neuroscientist, immunologist, and author. He is Professor Emeritus at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he previously held the Françoise Gilot-Salk chair. He was also an Adjunct Professor at the University of California San Diego.\n\nLemke has used molecular genetics to investigate the signaling networks that regulate immune system function and the development of the nervous system. His authored works have been published in academic journals, including Nature, Science, and Cell. He is the recipient of several awards, and was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2007.\n\n## Education\n\nLemke earned his S.B. in Life Sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a National Merit Scholar, in 1978. He was later awarded a Ph.D. in Biology from the California Institute of Technology in 1983, for work with Jeremy Brockes. He completed postdoctoral study in molecular biology with Richard Axel (Columbia University) in 1985.\n\n## Career\n\nLemke joined the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in 1985, eventually becoming Full Professor and Director of the Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory in 1995. He was awarded the Françoise Gilot-Salk Professorship in 2012, and was elected to three separate terms as Chair of the Salk Institute Faculty. In 2023, he was named Chief Science Officer of the Institute. He also held teaching appointments in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, beginning in 1988, eventually becoming Adjunct Professor in 1995. He founded Xetrios Therapeutics in 2009, which was later acquired by Kolltan Pharmaceuticals.\n\n## Research\n\nLemke's research spans discoveries in neurobiology and immunology, with a particular focus on receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their roles in cellular signaling, development, and immune regulation. His Ph.D. work identified glial growth factor (GGF), a protein critical for Schwann cell proliferation, elucidating its biochemical properties and distinguishing it from other growth factors. In his postdoctoral work with Axel, he cloned the Schwann cell gene that encodes myelin protein zero (MPZ), the major protein of the peripheral myelin sheath. He subsequently showed that MPZ is essential to the proper formation and function of this sheath. In his own lab at the Salk, he explored the intricate roles of RTKs in neural development, and in a single paper in 1991 provided the first identification of 11 of the 58 RTKs that are encoded in mammalian genomes. These novel RTKs included new members of the Eph, FGFR, and ErbB families, but also defined two entirely new RTK families. \n\nMuch of the subsequent work of the Lemke's lab has involved the genetic dissection, through the generation of mouse mutants, of the function of the novel RTKs identified in the 1991 paper. The most significant of these efforts address the ErbB, Eph, and, most notably, the TAM families. For example, he, along with his colleagues used loss-of-function mutants to show that ErbB4, a receptor for GGF and related ‘neuregulins’, is essential for cardiac muscle differentiation, Schwann cell survival, and neuronal axon guidance. The absence of ErbB4 in mice resulted in lethal cardiac and neural developmental defects, establishing its critical function in these processes. With respect to neural development, his combined gain- and loss-of-function studies of the EphA3, 4, 5, and 6 receptors explored sensory nervous system mapping.", token_ids=[2, 235345, 235248, 2,

Greg Erwin Lemke je ameriški nevroznanstvenik, imunolog in avtor. Je profesor emeritus na Salkovem inštitutu za biološke študije, kjer je pred tem zasedal stolček Françoise Gilot-Salk. Bil je tudi gostujoči profesor na Univerzi Kalifornije, San Diego.

Lemke je uporabil molekularno genetiko za raziskovanje signalnih mrež, ki uravnavajo funkcijo imunskega sistema in razvoj živčnega sistema. Njegova avtorska dela so bila objavljena v znanstvenih revijah, kot so Nature, Science in Cell. Je prejemnik več nagrad in je bil leta 2007 izvoljen za člana Ameriškega združenja za napredovanje znanosti.

## Izobraževanje

Lemke je leta 1978 na Tehnološkem inštitutu Massachusettsa pridobil diplomo iz življenjskih znanosti kot nacionalni štipendist. Leta 1983 je na Kalifornijskem tehnološkem inštitutu prejel doktorat iz biologije za delo z Jeremyjem Brockesom. Leta 1985 je opravil podiplomski študij molekularne biologije z Richardom Axelom (Univerza Columbia).

## Kariera

Leta 1985 se je pridružil Salkovemu inštitutu za biološke študije in leta 1995 postal polni profesor ter direktor laboratorija za molekularno nevrobiologijo. Leta 2012 je prejel stolček Françoise Gilot-Salk, leta 2023 pa je bil imenovan za glavnega znanstvenega uradnika inštituta. Leta 1988 se je pridružil Oddelku za nevroznanost na Medicinski fakulteti Univerze Kalifornije, San Diego, kjer je leta 1995 postal gostujoči profesor. Ustanovil je Xetrios Therapeutics leta 2009, ki ga je kasneje prevzela družba Kolltan Pharmaceuticals.

## Raziskave

Lemke je raziskoval zapletene vloge receptorjev tirozin kinaz (RTK) v signalizaciji, razvoju in imunski regulaciji. V svojem doktorskem delu je identificiral glijalni rastni faktor (GGF), protein, ki je ključnega pomena za proliferacijo Schwannovih celic, in raziskal njegove biokemične lastnosti ter ga ločil od drugih rastnih faktorjev. V svojem podiplomskem delu z Axelom je kloniral gen Schwannovih celic, ki kodira protein nič (MPZ) nič, glavni protein periferne mielinske ovojnice. Pozneje je pokazal, da je MPZ bistven za pravilno oblikovanje in delovanje te ovojnice.

V svojem laboratoriju na Salku je raziskoval zapletene vloge RTK v nevronskem razvoju in v enem članku iz leta 1991 prvi opisal 11 od 58 RTK, ki so kodirani v sesalskih genih. Ti novi RTK so vključevali nove člane družin Eph, FGF in ErbB, poleg tega pa so definirali tudi dve povsem novi družini RTK. Velik del nadaljnjega dela Lemkovega laboratorija je vključeval genetski razkos RTK, identificiranih v članku iz leta 1991, z uporabo mišjih mutant. Najpomembnejši med temi študijami so raziskovali družine ErbB, Eph in še posebej TAM.

Na primer, on in njegovi sodelavci so z uporabo mutant z izgubo funkcije pokazali, da je ErbB4, receptor za GGF in sorodne nevreguline, bistvenega pomena za diferenciacijo srčne mišice, preživetje Schwannovih celic in nevronsko usmerjanje aksonov. Odsotnost ErbB4 pri miših je povzročila smrtonosne nevronske in kardiovaskularne razvojne napake, kar je potrdilo njegovo ključno vlogo v teh procesih. Glede nevronskega razvoja so njegove skupne študije z dobljeno in izgubljeno funkcijo EphA receptorjev 3, 4, 5 in 6 raziskale kartiranje senzoričnega živčnega sistema. Ti eksperimenti so pokazali, da topografske nevronske povezave iz očesa v možgane vodijo relativne ravni izražanja EphA receptorjev v mrežnici, ki določajo nevronsko ciljanje.

Pomemben del Lemkovih študij se nanaša na 'TAM' receptorje – Tyro3, Axl in Mer. Ti receptorji so bili sprva 'sirote' – njihovi aktivirajoči ligandi so bili neznani. S sodelavci je ugotovil, da so ti ligandi protein S in Gas6, pri čemer je prvi znan po svoji vlogi v koagulaciji krvi. Ti izsledki so razkrili povezavo med proteaznimi kaskadami, celično signalizacijo in tkivnim razvojem. Velik del nadaljnjega dela je pokazal, da so TAM receptorji predv#Greg Lemke

Greg Erwin Lemke is an American neuroscientist, immunologist, and author. He is Professor Emeritus at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he previously held the Françoise Gilot-Salk chair. He was also an Adjunct Professor at the University of California San Diego.

Lemke has used molecular genetics to investigate the signaling networks that regulate immune system function and the development of the nervous system. His authored works have been published in academic journals, including Nature, Science, and Cell. He is the recipient of several awards, and was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2007.

## Education

Lemke earned his S.B. in Life Sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a National Merit Scholar, in 1978. He was later awarded a Ph.D. in Biology from the California Institute of Technology in 1983, for work with Jeremy Brockes. He completed postdoctoral study in molecular biology with Richard Axel (Columbia University) in 1985.

## Career

Lemke joined the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in 1985, eventually becoming Full Professor and Director of the Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory in 1995. He was awarded the Françoise Gilot-Salk Professorship in 2012, and was elected to three separate terms as Chair of the Salk Institute Faculty. In 2023, he was named Chief Science Officer of the Institute. He also held teaching appointments in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, beginning in 1988, eventually becoming Adjunct Professor in 1995. He founded Xetrios Therapeutics in 2009, which was later acquired by Kolltan Pharmaceuticals.

## Research

Lemke's research spans discoveries in neurobiology and immunology, with a particular focus on receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their roles in cellular signaling, development, and immune regulation. His Ph.D. work identified glial growth factor (GGF), a protein critical for Schwann cell proliferation, elucidating its biochemical properties and distinguishing it from other growth factors. In his postdoctoral work with Axel, he cloned the Schwann cell gene that encodes myelin protein zero (MPZ), the major protein of the peripheral myelin sheath. He subsequently showed that MPZ is essential to the proper formation and function of this sheath. In his own lab at the Salk, he explored the intricate roles of RTKs in neural development, and in a single paper in 1991 provided the first identification of 11 of the 58 RTKs that are encoded in mammalian genomes. These novel RTKs included new members of the Eph, FGFR, and ErbB families, but also defined two entirely new RTK families. 

Much of the subsequent work of the Lemke's lab has involved the genetic dissection, through the generation of mouse mutants, of the function of the novel RTKs identified in the 1991 paper. The most significant of these efforts address the ErbB, Eph, and, most notably, the TAM families. For example, he, along with his colleagues used loss-of-function mutants to show that ErbB4, a receptor for GGF and related ‘neuregulins’, is essential for cardiac muscle differentiation, Schwann cell survival, and neuronal axon guidance. The absence of ErbB4 in mice resulted in lethal cardiac and neural developmental defects, establishing its critical function in these processes. With respect to neural development, his combined gain- and loss-of-function studies of the EphA3, 4, 5, and 6 receptors explored sensory nervous system mapping.

basketball tournament\n\nThe 1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 64 schools playing in single-elimination play to determine the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball national champion for the 1992–93 season. It began on March 17, 1993, and ended with the championship game on April 5 in New Orleans, Louisiana at the Louisiana Superdome. A total of 63 games were played, including a national third-place game for the first time.\n\nNorth Carolina defeated rival and defending champion Michigan in the championship game 77–71 to win their third NCAA basketball championship. The Fab Five made their third straight appearance in the national championship game. The Tar Heels also became the first team to win the NCAA tournament as a #8 seed.\n\nThe tournament's officiating crew for the championship game was criticized for not calling fouls on North Carolina's players, who were alleged to have committed at least 12 goaltending violations.\n\nThis tournament is notable for the first subregional round, which was played at campus sites. The subregionals were played in the traditional regional format, with the East Regionals held at the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the Midwest Regionals at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia, the Mideast Regionals at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the West Regionals at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington.\n\n## Schedule and venues\n\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1993 tournament:\n\nOpening Round\n\n* March 17, 1993\n\n* \n* West Region\n\n* \n* \n* University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah (Host: Utah)\n\n* \n* \n* University of Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma (Host: Tulsa)\n\n* \n* \n* University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas (Host: UTEP)\n\n* \n* \n* University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, Wisconsin (Host: Wisconsin)\n\n* \n* East Region\n\n* \n* \n* University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina (Host: North Carolina)\n\n* \n* \n* University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Host: Pittsburgh)\n\n* \n* \n* University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island (Host: Rhode Island)\n\n* \n* \n* University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina (Host: South Carolina)\n\n* \n* Midwest Region\n\n* \n* \n* Creighton University, Omaha, Nebraska (Host: Creighton)\n\n* \n* \n* Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa (Host: Drake)\n\n* \n* \n* University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky (Host: Kentucky)\n\n* \n* \n* University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri (Host: Missouri)\n\n* \n* Mideast Region\n\n* \n* \n* Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana (Host: Ball State)\n\n* \n* \n* University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio (Host: Cincinnati)\n\n* \n* \n* University of Dayton, Dayton, Ohio (Host: Dayton)\n\n* \n* \n* University of Texas, Austin, Texas (Host: Texas)\n\nFirst and Second Rounds\n\n* March 19 and 21\n\n* \n* East Region\n\n* \n* \n* The Meadowlands Arena, East Rutherford, New Jersey (East Rutherford, New Jersey)\n\n* \n* Midwest Region\n\n* \n* \n* Omni Coliseum, Atlanta, Georgia (Atlanta)\n\n* \n* Mideast Region\n\n* \n* \n* RCA Dome, Indianapolis, Indiana (Indianapolis)\n\n* \n* West Region\n\n* \n* \n* Tacoma Dome, Tacoma, Washington (Tacoma)\n\nRegional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen) and finals (Elite Eight)\n\n* March 26 and 28\n\n* \n* East Regional\n\n* \n* \n* The Meadowlands Arena, East Rutherford, New Jersey (East Rutherford)\n\n* \n* Midwest Regional\n\n* \n* #Omni Coliseum, Atlanta, Georgia (Atlanta)\n\n* \n* Mideast Regional\n\n* \n* \n* RCA Dome, Indianapolis, Indiana (Indianapolis)\n\n* \n* West Regional\n\n* \n* \n* Tacoma Dome, Tacoma, Washington (Tacoma)\n\nNational semifinals (Final Four) and championship\n\n* April 3 and 5\n\n* \n* Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana (New Orleans)\n\n## Bracket\n\n* – Denotes overtime period\n\n## Notes\n\n* This was the first NCAA tournament to use the subregional round.\n\n* The 1993 tournament was the first time that a school in the state of Washington hosted an NCAA tournament game since the Pacific Coast Conference tournament was held in Seattle in 1959.\n\n* This was the first of four consecutive NCAA tournaments in which a #8 seed reached the Final Four.\n\n* This was the first of three consecutive NCAA tournaments in which a #8 seed won the national championship (1993, 1995, 1996).\n\n* This was the first of four straight NCAA tournaments in which the champion was not a #1 seed.\n\n* This was the first of six consecutive NCAA tournaments in which the defending champion did not make it to the Final Four.\n\n* This was the first NCAA championship game to be played on a Monday.\n\n* In the 1993 championship game, North Carolina defeated Michigan, 77–71.

Translation: # 1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament

The 1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 64 schools playing in single-elimination play to determine the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball national champion for the 1992–93 season. It began on March 17, 1993, and ended with the championship game on April 5 in New Orleans, Louisiana at the Louisiana Superdome. A total of 63 games were played, including a national third-place game for the first time.

North Carolina defeated rival and defending champion Michigan in the championship game 77–71 to win their third NCAA basketball championship. The Fab Five made their third straight appearance in the national championship game. The Tar Heels also became the first team to win the NCAA tournament as a #8 seed.

The tournament's officiating crew for the championship game was criticized for not calling fouls on North Carolina's players, who were alleged to have committed at least 12 goaltending violations.

This tournament is notable for the first subregional round, which was played at campus sites. The subregionals were played in the traditional regional format, with the East Regionals held at the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the Midwest Regionals at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia, the Mideast Regionals at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the West Regionals at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington.

The news was only confirmed a day later but no information was released regarding the crew. This is the first recorded aircraft accident involving the Chinese troops in Hong Kong since handover, and raised speculation on the details.\n\n## Accident\n\nAccording to the government, which received notification from the garrison, the helicopter was conducting flight training operation in the area of the Tai Lam Country Park in that afternoon. Villagers in Chuen Lung who witnessed the crash said there were heavy fog when the helicopter is believed to have crashed into an electricity transmission tower by accident. The chopper\'s noise stopped after explosions were heard, but no smoke or fire could be seen. The lost helicopter is believed to be a Harbin Z-9 (no. 6202).\n\nCLP Group confirmed a voltage dip incident at 4:48\xa0p.m. at a 400kV overhead line power cable connecting Lung Kwu Tan and Sha Tin which lasted for less than 0.1 seconds. The fire service received 42 reports of lift malfunction across the city within 15 minutes after the incident, while Chuen Lung residents also reported a sudden loss of electricity. Photos showed the tower and parts of the cable were damaged.\n\nA dozen of military vehicles and large group of soldiers were spotted by nearby Lui Kung Tin villagers soon after the accident. A number of helicopter flew near the location but turned away likely because of the weather condition. According to the villagers and hikers, at 7 a.m. on the next day more than a hundred military personnel, along with many police officers, entered Tai Lam Country Park via Lui Kung Tin. Some had shovels and other tools in their hands. By 9 a.m. the site was sealed off by the police and the garrison. Witnesses said a senior soldier from Hong Kong Garrison claimed there was a military exercise for the large presence of soldiers. The officers stayed for hours and remained at the crash site after 2 p.m., while CLP maintenance vehicles also travelled uphill afterwards.\n\n## Reaction\n\nThe government confirmed the news after 8 p.m. through press release, more than 27 hours after the accident. The Chinese statement described it as a crash but the English version termed "accident". Neither provided details about what had happened apart from no ground injuries.... A notification was received from the Chinese People\'s Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison (the Garrison) today to inform the Security Bureau of an accident involving a helicopter of the Garrison which occurred in the afternoon of March 30 during the Garrison\'s flight training operation conducted in the area of the Tai Lam Country Park. The incident did not involve any injury to people or damage to residences. The Garrison is handling and investigating the incident in accordance with the Garrison Law. The Security Bureau will continue to liaise with the Garrison on the incident.The fire service said they have no relevant record on handling a helicopter incident in Tai Lam.\n\nThe pro-democracy camp urged for transparency in this event. Eddie Chu, who was one of the first public figures to break the news, demanded the Security Bureau to reveal more details on the most serious accident involving the Hong Kong garrison since the handover, including the casualties and crew information. He also enquired the impact on the electricity supply by the crash and whether the garrison notified the authorities of the training in accordance with garrison law. MP James To said the crash may involve military confidential information and would not notify the government until the site was cleared. To added however that public safety could be harmed by bullets or wrecks if it was not announced immediately. Jeremy Tam, a former pilot and now a pro-democracy legislator, agreed the delay on announcement and cordoning off the area could worry hikers who had no knowledge on the event. He said Civil Aviation Department has no power to investigate and the crash would be dealt with by the garrison.\n\nJournalists searched for the wreck near Tsing Tam reservoir. On 2 April, a 25 square metres of flatted bushes with cracked trunk and cable was found on a slope near Kap Lung Forest Trail. Fuel could also be smelled from the area. Debris of the helicopter including suspected control panel, buttons of equipment were seen alongside pieces of military uniform, glucose injections, and flying manual of Harbin Z-9. However, no large pieces of wrecks or blood stain were seen. Lunchboxes and water bottles of Chinese brand Nongfu Spring were disposed on a nearby path that appears to be created recently. A day later, a group of men was seen carrying a suspected plane debris away. None told the journalists of their identity or the item they took away.\n\n## References\n\nMarch 2020\nPeople\'s Liberation Army Hong Kong garrison\n2020 in Hong Kong\nAccidents and incidents involving helicopters', 'role': 'user'}]

He has received awards, including the 2002 Vitamin Prize from the Society for Applied Vitamin Research, the Society of Free Radicals\' Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014, the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Distinguished Service Award in 2016, and the Nencki Award from the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology in 2016.\n\nAzzi is a Foreign Member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and a Lifetime Honorary Member of the Oxygen Club of California. He also holds editorial roles, including Editor-in-Chief of journals such as Molecular Aspects of Medicine and Aspects of Molecular Medicine.\n\n## Education and career\n\nAzzi earned an MD in 1963 from the University of Padua, followed by a PhD in General Pathology in 1969 and a PhD in Biochemistry in 1970. He worked at Institute of General Pathology under Massimo Aloisi, where he explored mitochondrial function and later collaborated with Giovanni Felice Azzone, contributing to the discovery of the permeability transition pore. In 1966, he pursued postdoctoral research as a Fellow in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Bristol, focusing on mitochondrial transporters, and continued as a Research Fellow in the Department of Biophysics at the University of Pennsylvania from 1967 to 1969, studying mitochondrial membrane functions. Returning to Italy in the early 1970s, he became a Professor in 1973. In 1977, he relocated to Bern, Switzerland, becoming a Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Bern.\n\nAt the University of Bern, Azzi was the Head of the Department of the Medical Chemistry Institute, later serving as Professor and Director of the Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from 1984 to 2005, when he was named Professor Emeritus.\n\nAzzi served on the Advisory Board of UNESCO\'s International Scientific Advisory Board/International Biological and Scientific Programme (ISAB/IBSP) from 1997 to 2015. During this period, he held the position of President of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) from 2006 to 2012 and Past-President from 2013 to 2015. His leadership also extended to the Society for Free Radical Research International, where he acted as President from 2007 to 2010 and Past-President from 2010 to 2013.\n\n## Research\n\nAzzi has researched the mechanisms through which vitamin E and lycopene prevent prostate cancer and has discovered the transport carrier for aspartic and glutamic acids in mitochondria. He has evaluated vitamin E\'s roles beyond its antioxidative properties, highlighting its involvement in cellular signaling, gene regulation, and disease prevention. In a joint study with Achim Stocker, he explored the functions of α-tocopherol, revealing its selective antioxidant role, non-antioxidant mechanisms, and effects on cellular processes, including protein kinase C inhibition and gene transcription. He also investigated the effects of α-tocopherol on cell proliferation, demonstrating its concentration-dependent inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation through protein kinase C inhibition. His findings suggested that α-tocopherol has non-antioxidant molecular functions, acting as a ligand for proteins that regulate signal transduction and gene expression, with no compensatory antioxidant response observed in its deficiency. Building upon this, he looked into the effect of lycopene, alone or with other antioxidants, on the growth of prostate carcinoma cell lines, and found that lycopene alone was not a potent inhibitor, but its combination with α-tocopherol strongly inhibited cell proliferation in a synergistic manner. Furthermore, examining the role of protein kinase C in signal transduction, he emphasized its activation by various agents and involvement in tumor promotion, while calling for additional research into its physiological substrates. His work also analyzed the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, identifying the superoxide radical as a precursor of HO generation.\n\nAzzi has published course books, including Membrane Proteins: Isolation and Characterization (1986), Dynamics of Membrane Proteins and Cellular Energetics (1988), and Organelles in Eukaryotic Cells: Molecular Structure and Interactions (1989). In 1989, he co-edited Molecular Basis of Membrane-Associated Diseases with Zdenek Drahota and Sergio Papa, examining molecular changes in biological membranes linked to diseases like lysosomal, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial disorders, enzyme defects, and receptor abnormalities related to oncogenes. That same year, he co-edited Anion Carriers of Mitochondrial Membranes with Katarzyna A. Nalecz, Maciej J. Nalecz, and Lech Wojtczak, covering the structure, function, isolation, transport kinetics, and metabolic regulation of mitochondrial anion carriers. In 2000, he co-authored Antioxidants in Diabetes Management (Oxidative Stress and Disease) with Peter Rosen, Hans J. Tritschler, and Glenn A. King, exploring oxidative stress in diabetes and the potential of antioxidant therapies. Reviewing the book for Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kailash Prasad wrote, "the authors should be commended for an admirable job in framing a succinct review of the pathophysiology associated with the development of diabetes and its associated complications, and opportunities that antioxidants might offer for therapy in diabetes."\n\n## Awards and honors\n \n\n* 1994 – Foreign Member, Polish Academy of Sciences\n\n* 2001 – Lifetime Honorary Member, Oxygen Club of California\n\n* 2002 – Vitamin Prize, Society for Applied Vitamin Research\n\n* 2014 – Lifetime Achievement Award, Society of Free Radicals Europe\n\n* 2016 – Distinguished Service Award, International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology\n\n* 2016 – Nencki Award, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology\n\n## Selected books\n\n* Membrane Proteins: Isolation and Characterization (1986) ISBN 978-3540170143\n\n* Molecular Basis of Membrane-Associated Diseases (1989) ISBN 978-3642744174\n\n* Organelles in Eukaryotic Cells: Molecular Structure and Interactions (1989) ISBN 978-0306433887\n\n* Anion Carriers of Mitochondrial Membranes (1989) ISBN 978-3642745416\n\n* Antioxidants in Diabetes Management (Oxidative Stress and Disease) (2000) ISBN 978-0824788445\n\n## Selected articles\n\n* Loschen, G., Azzi, A., Richter, C., & Flohé, L.

of a class session. The purpose of a problem of the day is to engage students in mathematical thinking, to provide a mental warm-up, and to encourage students to think creatively and critically about mathematics. Problem of the day activities can be used in any mathematics class, from elementary school to university level.\n\n## History\n\nThe concept of a problem of the day has been used in mathematics education for many years, particularly in the context of the Problem of the Day Club in the United Kingdom. The Problem of the Day Club was founded in 1983 by John Steiner, a mathematics teacher at Sevenoaks School in Kent. The club was designed to promote mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills among students.\n\n## Format and usage\n\nA problem of the day is typically presented at the beginning of a mathematics class session, often on the chalkboard or through a digital platform. The problem is designed to be accessible to all students in the class, regardless of their current level of mathematical knowledge. Students are encouraged to work on the problem individually or in small groups, and to share their solutions and reasoning with the class at the end of the period.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThere are several benefits to using a problem of the day in mathematics education:\n\nEncourages critical thinking: By presenting students with problems that require them to think creatively and critically, a problem of the day helps to develop their problem-solving skills.\nBuilds confidence: When students are able to solve a problem of the day, it can boost their confidence in their mathematical abilities.\nImproves communication skills: Working on a problem of the day in a group setting helps students to develop their communication skills as they discuss their ideas and solutions with each other.\nIncreases engagement: Presenting a problem of the day at the beginning of a class session can help to increase student engagement and make the class more interesting.\n\n## Sample problems\n\nSample problems of the day can include a variety of mathematical topics, from basic arithmetic to more advanced concepts like calculus or geometry. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Magic Squares: Can you create a 3x3 magic square where the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is 15?\n2. Number Patterns: What is the next number in the sequence 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16?\n3. Area of a Triangle: If the sides of a triangle are 3, 4, and 5, what is the area of the triangle?\n4. The Josephus Problem: 10 people are standing in a circle. Starting with the first person, every second person is eliminated until only one person remains. Who is the last person standing?\n5. The Birthday Paradox: What is the probability that at least two people in a room of 23 people share the same birthday?\n\n## Variations\n\nThere are many variations of the problem of the day concept that can be used in mathematics education. Some examples include:\n\nMath Minute: A shorter, more concise version of the problem of the day, typically lasting only a few minutes.\nPuzzle of the Day: A more open-ended problem that requires students to think creatively and come up with multiple solutions.\nBrain Teaser of the Day: A short, humorous or quirky problem that is designed to make students laugh while also engaging their mathematical thinking.\nChallenge of the Week: A more complex problem that students can work on throughout the week and present their solutions on Friday.\n\n## Resources\n\nThere are many resources available to help teachers create and implement a problem of the day in their mathematics classes. Some examples include:\n\nMathematical Association of America: The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) offers a variety of problem solving resources, including a Problem of the Day section on their website.\nNational Council of Teachers of Mathematics: The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) also offers problem solving resources, including a Problem of the Day section on their website.\nOnline Resources: There are many online resources available, such as MathOverflow, Math Stack Exchange, and various educational websites that offer problem of the day puzzles.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA problem of the day is a powerful tool for engaging students in mathematical thinking and problem-solving. By presenting students with interesting and challenging problems, teachers can help to develop their critical thinking skills, build their confidence, and increase their engagement in mathematics. With the many resources available, there is no shortage of problems to choose from, and the possibilities for variation are endless.\n\n## References\n\n1. Steiner, J. (1983).

Translation: # # Problem of the day

In mathematics education, a problem of the day (POD) is a short mathematical problem or puzzle presented to students at the beginning of a class session. The purpose of a problem of the day is to engage students in mathematical thinking, to provide a mental warm-up, and to encourage students to think creatively and critically about mathematics. Problem of the day activities can be used in any mathematics class, from elementary school to university level.

## History

The concept of a problem of the day has been used in mathematics education for many years, particularly in the context of the Problem of the Day Club in the United Kingdom. The Problem of the Day Club was founded in 1983 by John Steiner, a mathematics teacher at Sevenoaks School in Kent. The club was designed to promote mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills among students.

## Format and usage

A problem of the day is typically presented at the beginning of a mathematics class session, often on the chalkboard or through a digital platform. The problem is designed to be accessible to all students in the class, regardless of their current level of mathematical knowledge. Students are encouraged to work on the problem individually or in small groups, and to share their solutions and reasoning with the class at the end of the period.

## Benefits

There are several benefits to using a problem of the day in mathematics education:

Encourages critical thinking: By presenting students with problems that require them to think creatively and critically, a problem of the day helps to develop their problem-solving skills.
Builds confidence: When students are able to solve a problem of the day, it can boost their confidence in their mathematical abilities.
Improves communication skills: Working on a problem of the day in a group setting helps students to develop their communication skills as they discuss their ideas and solutions with each other.
Increases engagement: Presenting a problem of the day at the beginning of a class session can help to increase student engagement and make the class more interesting.

## Sample problems

Sample problems of the day can include a variety of mathematical topics, from basic arithmetic to more advanced concepts like calculus or geometry. Here are a few examples:

1. Magic Squares: Can you create a 3x3 magic square where the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is 15?
2. Number Patterns: What is the next number in the sequence 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16?
3. Area of a Triangle: If the sides of a triangle are 3, 4, and 5, what is the area of the triangle?
4. The Josephus Problem: 10 people are standing in a circle. Starting with the first person, every second person is eliminated until only one person remains. Who is the last person standing?
5. The Birthday Paradox: What is the probability that at least two people in a room of 23 people share the same birthday?

## Variations

There are many variations of the problem of the day concept that can be used in mathematics education. Some examples include:

Math Minute: A shorter, more concise version of the problem of the day, typically lasting only a few minutes.
Puzzle of the Day: A more open-ended problem that requires students to think creatively and come up with multiple solutions.
Brain Teaser of the Day: A short, humorous or quirky problem that is designed to make students laugh while also engaging their mathematical thinking.
Challenge of the Week: A more complex problem that students can work on throughout the week and present their solutions on Friday.

## Resources

There are many resources available to help teachers create and implement a problem of the day in their mathematics classes. Some examples include:

Mathematical Association of America: The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) offers a variety of problem solving resources, including a Problem of the Day section on their website.
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics: The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) also offers problem solving resources, including a Problem of the Day section on their website.
Online Resources: There are many online resources available, such as MathOverflow, Math Stack Exchange, and various educational websites that offer problem of the day puzzles.

## Conclusion

A problem of the day is a powerful tool for engaging students in mathematical thinking and problem-solving. By presenting students with interesting and challenging problems, teachers can help to develop their critical thinking skills, build their confidence, and increase their engagement in mathematics. With the many resources available, there is no shortage of problems to choose from, and the possibilities for variation are endless.

During the mid-1980s, Gusev was a lieutenant general serving as deputy commander of the Carpathian Military District. \n\nGusev was subsequently appointed as head of the Soviet military mission in Angola in 1987, succeeding Lieutenant General Leonid Kuzmenko. In this role, Gusev directly planned and supervised combat operations for the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA), with the oversight of Angolan Defence Minister Pedro Pedalé. He was the senior Soviet general officer involved in the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale. Throughout the battle, Gusev personally briefed Angolan president José Eduardo dos Santos on the military situation.\n\nGusev was a controversial figure among the Soviet military forces in Angola. He often vetoed commendations for Soviet enlisted personnel and junior officers who had been directly engaged in hostilities. The Soviet troops primarily served in technical and support roles, although circumstances often dictated they fight alongside their Angolan peers if attacked by UNITA insurgents or South African expeditionary forces. Gusev also garnered criticism for ordering offensives without taking into account the logistical challenges and technical shortcomings of the Angolan forces expected to execute these complex operations. \n\nGusev published his memoirs after his retirement from military service.\n\n## References\n\n1932 births\n2024 deaths\nSoviet lieutenant generals\nSoviet military personnel of the Angolan Civil War\nPeople of the South African Border War\nPeople from Udmurtia", 'role': 'user'}]

During the mid-1980s, Gusev was a lieutenant general serving as deputy commander of the Carpathian Military District. \n\nGusev was subsequently appointed as head of the Soviet military mission in Angola in 1987, succeeding Lieutenant General Leonid Kuzmenko. In this role, Gusev directly planned and supervised combat operations for the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA), with the oversight of Angolan Defence Minister Pedro Pedalé. He was the senior Soviet general officer involved in the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale. Throughout the battle, Gusev personally briefed Angolan president José Eduardo dos Santos on the military situation.\n\nGusev was a controversial figure among the Soviet military forces in Angola. He often vetoed commendations for Soviet enlisted personnel and junior officers who had been directly engaged in hostilities. The Soviet troops primarily served in technical and support roles, although circumstances often dictated they fight alongside their Angolan peers if attacked by UNITA insurgents or South African expeditionary forces. Gusev also garnered criticism for ordering offensives without taking into account the logistical challenges and technical shortcomings of the Angolan forces expected to execute these complex operations. \n\nGusev published his memoirs after his retirement from military service.\n\n## References\n\n1932 births\n2024 deaths\nSoviet lieutenant generals\nSoviet military personnel of the Angolan Civil War\nPeople of the South African Border War\nPeople from Udmurtia<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", prompt_token_ids=[2, 2, 106, 1645, 108, 3035, 96640, 219276, 68015, 9561, 67213, 3400, 509, 8494, 593, 154549, 40456, 1925, 235265, 108, 235345, 596, 5506, 538, 653, 1589, 235272, 591, 148987, 235275, 109, 235295, 5506, 538, 29354, 66203, 653, 1589, 235272, 3022, 591, 12675, 235248, 235274, 235269, 235248, 235274, 235315, 235304, 235284, 1157, 5424, 235248, 235274, 235269, 235248, 235284, 235276, 235284, 235310, 235275, 729, 476, 17569, 578, 11200, 7460, 25574, 235265, 9931, 573, 3465, 235290, 235274, 235315, 235321, 235276, 235256, 235269, 653, 1589, 235272, 729, 476, 67432, 3311, 14825, 685, 37506, 31863, 576, 573, 2244, 6389, 102411, 26723, 8867, 235265, 235248, 109, 235319, 1589, 235272, 729, 27956, 14824, 685, 2206, 576, 573, 17569, 8403, 9671, 575, 69503, 575, 235248, 235274, 235315, 235321, 235324, 235269, 64205, 41943, 5105, 213198, 95309, 631, 2034, 235265, 878, 736, 4731, 235269, 653, 1589, 235272, 6673, 14196, 578, 66412, 15533, 8582, 604, 573, 8317, 235303, 235256, 59887, 33998, 576, 91527, 576, 69503, 591, 235311, 1902, 5110, 823, 675, 573, 67375, 576, 3990, 30767, 42216, 8846, 23290, 131670, 235335, 235265, 1315, 729, 573, 11841, 17569, 3311, 11053, 6664, 575, 573, 18949, 576, 10926, 2355, 585, 6116, 782, 1091, 235265, 52208, 573, 9509, 235269, 653, 1589, 235272, 17267, 157190, 3990, 30767, 9456, 18173, 53347, 3834, 32208, 611, 573, 8403, 5841, 235265, 109, 235319, 1589, 235272, 729, 476, 38357, 5774, 3932, 573, 17569, 8403, 9364, 575, 69503, 235265, 1315, 3695, 74173, 509, 681, 29612, 604, 17569, 79979, 13061, 578, 21098, 10971, 1064, 1093, 1125, 6673, 15504, 575, 122222, 235265, 714, 17569, 18816, 17022, 9180, 575, 9838, 578, 2676, 16065, 235269, 7546, 11702, 3695, 93009, 984, 5900, 22814, 1024, 3990, 30767, 37941, 1013, 25900, 731, 4571, 21916, 149728, 689, 4316, 10742, 40753, 828, 9364, 235265, 653, 1589, 235272, 1170, 126744, 23799, 604, 26663, 222202, 1143, 2346, 4998, 1280, 3185, 573, 148626, 12382, 578, 9838, 86568, 576, 573, 3990, 30767, 9364, 5043, 577, 17991, 1450, 5766, 8582, 235265, 235248, 109, 235319, 1589, 235272, 7018, 926, 138962, 1452, 926, 22531, 774, 8403, 2566, 235265, 109, 1620, 24287, 109, 235274, 235315, 235304, 235284, 80654, 108, 235284, 235276, 235284, 235310, 22009, 108, 82521, 67432, 84930, 108, 82521, 8403, 13061, 576, 573, 3990, 30767, 13714, 4143, 108, 13258, 576, 573, 4316, 10742, 23719, 4143, 108, 13258, 774, 752, 20247, 525, 9437, 107, 108, 106, 2516, 108, 1], encoder_prompt=None, encoder_prompt_token_ids=None, prompt_logprobs=None, outputs=[CompletionOutput(index=0, text='# The Legend of the White Horse\n\nThe Legend of the White Horse is an album released by American jazz trumpeter and composer Wadada Leo Smith and his band, the Golden Quartet, on the Silkheart label in 1997.

According to the Book of the Great Map, in 1627, some Kalmyk tribes neighbored the Kazakhs in the areas around the Sarysu and Kenderlik rivers. In the fall of the same year, the Kalmyk leader Chokhur-Taisha, who had previously been defeated by the Kazakhs, launched a new campaign against the Kazakh Khanate. He managed to assemble an army of about 40,000 men.\n\nThe results of this campaign were reported by Russian musketeers who had returned from Turkmen captivity: "This autumn, a force of forty thousand Kalmyks marched on the Kazakh Horde, and the Kazakh king, with his people, defeated and dispersed them. The remnants of the Kalmyk army, numbering about two thousand men, retreated to the upper reaches of the Emba River." This indicates that the Kazakh army delivered a crushing defeat to Chokhur-Taisha\'s forces.\n\nAs Yesim Khan\'s authority strengthened, there were notable successes in the struggle against the Kalmyks.

Translation: # Kalmyks campaign against Kazakhs (1627)

Kalmyks campaign against Kazakhs (1627) — Chokhur-taishi's campaign against the Kazakhs.

In the early years of Yesim Khan's reign, the threat of Kalmyk incursions into Kazakh lands persisted. According to the Book of the Great Map, in 1627, some Kalmyk tribes neighbored the Kazakhs in the areas around the Sarysu and Kenderlik rivers. In the fall of the same year, the Kalmyk leader Chokhur-Taisha, who had previously been defeated by the Kazakhs, launched a new campaign against the Kazakh Khanate. He managed to assemble an army of about 40,000 men.

The results of this campaign were reported by Russian musketeers who had returned from Turkmen captivity: "This autumn, a force of forty thousand Kalmyks marched on the Kazakh Horde, and the Kazakh king, with his people, defeated and dispersed them. The remnants of the Kalmyk army, numbering about two thousand men, retreated to the upper reaches of the Emba River." This indicates that the Kazakh army delivered a crushing defeat to Chokhur-Taisha's forces.

As Yesim Khan's authority strengthened, there were notable successes in the struggle against the Kalmyks. The Kazakhs managed to drive the Kalmyk tribes, who had been roaming the valleys of the Irtysh River, to its right bank. I. Y. Zlatkin noted: "Lake Yamyshevo, which two or three decades earlier had been one of the centers of Oirat migrations, had now become their frontier point."

The club was originally founded in 1982 and currently competes in Latrobe Valley Soccer League and are often to referred to as the Tyers Lightning.\n\nThe club was formed in order to bring high level competitive football to the town of Tyers, drawing its players and fans from nearby, larger towns including Yallourn North, Glengarry and from Latrobe City's biggest city, Traralgon, which is less than 10 kilometres away.\n\nThe club is still yet to win a senior men's LVSL title but did win back-to-back women's league titles in 2014 and 2015, as well as a hattrick of grand final victories in 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n\n## Club forms and accepted into LVSL (1982-2008)\n\nTyers' journey into the Latrobe Valley Soccer League was somewhat unexpected, for the township holds less than 1000 people, making it one of Victoria's smallest towns to have a soccer clubs competing in an organised league.\n\nHowever, the proximity of the club to other major towns - more than 30,000 people live within 10 minutes' drive - has always ensured the club's viability and popularity.\n\nThe club's journey started modestly with junior teams in the Under-8 and Under-10 categories, playing on the school football oval. In 1984, the Tyers Recreation Reserve designated land for a soccer pitch, which is where the club plays today. Early efforts to create a functional soccer environment included mowing the pitch with lawn mowers, selling food from car boots, and repurposing a disused turbine box from the Loy Yang Power Station as change rooms. The goals themselves were handmade by the founding families. \n\nA significant development came in 1986 with the construction of the original pavilion, funded by a major grant from the Latrobe City Council. The pavilion included a canteen, toilets, and an changing room. \n\nBy 1992, the club had expanded to include an Under-12 team, with subsequent progress to full junior teams as the children grew.

The club was originally founded in 1982 and currently competes in Latrobe Valley Soccer League and are often to referred to as the Tyers Lightning.\n\nThe club was formed in order to bring high level competitive football to the town of Tyers, drawing its players and fans from nearby, larger towns including Yallourn North, Glengarry and from Latrobe City's biggest city, Traralgon, which is less than 10 kilometres away.\n\nThe club is still yet to win a senior men's LVSL title but did win back-to-back women's league titles in 2014 and 2015, as well as a hattrick of grand final victories in 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n\n## Club forms and accepted into LVSL (1982-2008)\n\nTyers' journey into the Latrobe Valley Soccer League was somewhat unexpected, for the township holds less than 1000 people, making it one of Victoria's smallest towns to have a soccer clubs competing in an organised league.\n\nHowever, the proximity of the club to other major towns - more than 30,000 people live within 10 minutes' drive - has always ensured the club's viability and popularity.\n\nThe club's journey started modestly with junior teams in the Under-8 and Under-10 categories, playing on the school football oval. In 1984, the Tyers Recreation Reserve designated land for a soccer pitch, which is where the club plays today. Early efforts to create a functional soccer environment included mowing the pitch with lawn mowers, selling food from car boots, and repurposing a disused turbine box from the Loy Yang Power Station as change rooms. The goals themselves were handmade by the founding families. \n\nA significant development came in 1986 with the construction of the original pavilion, funded by a major grant from the Latrobe City Council. The pavilion included a canteen, toilets, and an changing room. \n\nBy 1992, the club had expanded to include an Under-12 team, with subsequent progress to full junior teams as the children grew. In 1996, the club entered its first senior team in the LVSL.\n\n## Women's team emerges as a local force (2009-)\n\nWhilst Tyers' men's team continued to struggle on the field, the formation of a women's league in 2009 signalled something of a turning point for the club's fortunes.\n\nTyers' women's team finished fourth in the LVSL in 2010 but rose above all comers in the finals series, winning the grand final to claim the very first of silverware for the club. \n\nAfter finishing runner's up in the 2012 Browne-Huizer Cup, the women's team finished runner's up in the league in 2013, signalling their arrival as a championship threat. \n\nTyers then broke through in major style in 2014, winning the LSVL's women's league, the league grand final and the Browne-Huizer Cup - the first pieces of silverware the club had claimed at senior level in men's or women's football. \n\nThey followed it up in 2015 with another victory in the league and the grand final, but fell short in the league in 2016, finishing as runner's up. \n\nThe club celebrated its 40-year anniversary in 2022.\n\n## Club colors and badge\n\nThe club plays in gold and green jerseys.\n\n## Stadium\n\nThe club plays its home matches at Bailie Reserve (also known as Tyers Recreation Reserve), which has a capacity of 500 (with a seating capacity of 100).\n\nIn 2011, the club enhanced its facilities with the installation of two major lighting towers, made possible through a grant.

film directed by Maurice Tourneur and starring Wallace Beery, Noah Beery, and Anna Q. Nilsson. Based on the 1826 novel of the same name by James Fenimore Cooper, the film was produced by Famous Players–Lasky and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It is not known whether the film currently survives.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1757, during the French and Indian War, two British officers, Major Duncan Heyward and Lieutenant Magua, are ambushed by Indians. Heyward is saved by Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans, and his son Uncas. Chingachgook adopts Heyward as his son. The three men travel to a British fort.\n\nHeyward falls in love with Cora Munro, the daughter of the fort\'s commander. Cora\'s sister Alice is in love with Magua. Magua is a Huron chief, and is plotting to kidnap and marry Alice.\n\nThe British soldiers must go to war. Chingachgook, Uncas, and Heyward stay behind to protect the women. Magua and his men attack the fort, and the three men fight to save the women.\n\n## Cast\n\n* Wallace Beery as Chingachgook\n\n* Noah Beery as Magua\n\n* Anna Q. Nilsson as Cora Munro\n\n* Edythe Chapman as Alice Munro\n\n* Wallace MacDonald as Major Duncan Heyward\n\n* Lloyd Whitlock as Uncas\n\n* George Periolat as Huron Chief\n\n* William H. Tooker as Colonel Munro\n\n* Robert Cain as Captain\n\n## Production\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans was the second film adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper\'s novel. It was directed by Maurice Tourneur, who had made his American debut with the highly successful adventure film The Last of the Knickerbockers (1919). It was filmed on location in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State.\n\n## Reception\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans was well received by the critics. A review in The New York Times praised the film, stating, "The story has been told with a faithfulness to the original that is remarkable and yet with so much of the spirit of the book that the screen version has the same thrilling and absorbing qualities as the book itself." The reviewer added, "The Last of the Mohicans, as presented by the Famous Players–Lasky organization, is a production that will live in the memory of those who see it."\n\n## Preservation status\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans is now considered a lost film, although a few still photographs survive.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nThe novel and its film adaptations have been parodied in the fourth season of the TV series The Good Place. In the episode "The Answer", the residents of The Good Place are assigned to a series of "bad place" tasks based on famous works of literature, and the group\'s task is to re-enact The Last of the Mohicans. The episode includes many of the film\'s plot points, including a tomahawk fight between Jason and Derek, and Eleanor and Janet playing the sisters Alice and Cora.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of films and television shows about the American Revolution\n\n* List of lost films\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* Connelly, Robert B.

Translation: # The Last of the Mohicans (1920 film)

The Last of the Mohicans is a 1920 American silent adventure film directed by Maurice Tourneur and starring Wallace Beery, Noah Beery, and Anna Q. Nilsson. Based on the 1826 novel of the same name by James Fenimore Cooper, the film was produced by Famous Players–Lasky and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It is not known whether the film currently survives.

## Plot

In 1757, during the French and Indian War, two British officers, Major Duncan Heyward and Lieutenant Magua, are ambushed by Indians. Heyward is saved by Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans, and his son Uncas. Chingachgook adopts Heyward as his son. The three men travel to a British fort.

Heyward falls in love with Cora Munro, the daughter of the fort's commander. Cora's sister Alice is in love with Magua. Magua is a Huron chief, and is plotting to kidnap and marry Alice.

The British soldiers must go to war. Chingachgook, Uncas, and Heyward stay behind to protect the women. Magua and his men attack the fort, and the three men fight to save the women.

## Cast

* Noah Beery as Magua

* Anna Q. Nilsson as Cora Munro

* Edythe Chapman as Alice Munro

* Wallace MacDonald as Major Duncan Heyward

* Lloyd Whitlock as Uncas

## Production

The Last of the Mohicans was the second film adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's novel. It was directed by Maurice Tourneur, who had made his American debut with the highly successful adventure film The Last of the Knickerbockers (1919). It was filmed on location in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State.

## Reception

The Last of the Mohicans was well received by the critics. A review in The New York Times praised the film, stating, "The story has been told with a faithfulness to the original that is remarkable and yet with so much of the spirit of the book that the screen version has the same thrilling and absorbing qualities as the book itself." The reviewer added, "The Last of the Mohicans, as presented by the Famous Players–Lasky organization, is a production that will live in the memory of those who see it."

## Preservation status

The Last of the Mohicans is now considered a lost film, although a few still photographs survive.

## In popular culture

The novel and its film adaptations have been parodied in the fourth season of the TV series The Good Place. In the episode "The Answer", the residents of The Good Place are assigned to a series of "bad place" tasks based on famous works of literature, and the group's task is to re-enact The Last of the Mohicans. The episode includes many of the film's plot points, including a tomahawk fight between Jason and Derek, and Eleanor and Janet playing the sisters Alice and Cora.

[{'content': 'Prevedi naslednje angleško besedilo v slovenščino.\n# Platon Rozhdestvensky\n\nPlaton (Rozhdestvensky) (; - April 20, 1934), born Porphyry Theodorovich Rozhdestvensky (), was the Russian Orthodox Archbishop of the Aleutians and North America from 1907 to 1914 and again from 1922 to 1934.\n\n## Early life\n\nPlaton was born as Porphyry Theodorovich Rozhdestvensky on February 23, 1866, to a priest near Kursk, Russia. In 1886 he graduated from Kursk Seminary and in 1894 he enrolled in the Kiev Theological Academy where he took on the name Platon and graduated the following year, obtaining a Master of Theology in the same institution in 1898. After graduation he continued to work at the university as professor, rector, and eventually dean.\n\n## Bishop\n\nOn June 3, 1902, he was consecrated as Bishop of Kiev. He was elected to the Second State Duma on February 12, 1907, due to his popularity amongst the locals in Kiev.\n\n## Arrival in America\n\nPlaton was elected as Archbishop of North America for the first time on June 8, 1907, where he would preside for the next seven years. He faced many challenges including a priest shortage, ethnic nationalism amongst the diaspora populations, and unpopularity of the church (in part due to resistance towards Russian hegemony). Platon\'s primary concern was the question of administering Ukrainian and Russian churches, and most ethnic missions were largely overlooked. In December 1908, he also founded the Russian Orthodox Christian Immigrant Society of North America, with the goal of protecting newly arrived immigrants from Austria-Hungary, Galicia, and Russia.\n\nUnder Platon\'s leadership, efforts were made to nationalize the church. In February 1908, Platon organized an Albanian Orthodox Mission in America that included six parishes in Hudson, Massachusetts in response to a petition made by the local Albanian population after an independently owned Greek church refused to bury an Albanian nationalist. In 1909, a bill was vetoed by Governor Charles E. Hughes in the New York State Legislature after protests by the local Greek population. The law would have effectively placed the Greek parishes under Russian control. In a letter to Dean Pashkovsky discussing the possibility of a more unified church in North America, Platon expressed frustration with the Greek led opposition, stating "...it seems it [a unified leadership] is unfeasible when taking into consideration the self sufficiency of the Greeks...in all matters religion and faith". In 1913, a group of 19 Serbian churches briefly seceded until reconciliation was made in which the Russian delegation agreed to be more solicitous of Serbian complaints.\n\nIn 1912, he moved the first seminary in North America, St. Tikhon\'s, from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Tenafly, New Jersey in order to be closer to church administration, and was renamed St. Platon\'s Seminary. It was closed down in 1923 due to financial difficulties.\n\n## Return to Russia\n\nUpon his return to Russia, Platon was appointed Archbishop of Kishinev and Khotyn on March 20, 1914, before being transferred to the see of Kartalin and Kakheti on December 5, 1915. Platon remained there until the restoration of autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church in 1917, after of which he served as bishop of Kherson and Odessa until having to flee due to the Russian Revolution. Platon was a major participant in the All-Russian Council, and was considered as a candidate for Patriarchate of the Russian Church. During the council, Platon also suggested appointing a Greek bishop "who has studied in a Russian theological institute" in North America. During the council, Platon was also given the task of negotiating with the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. On December that year he was elected to the Holy Synod and represented a delegation in Kiev in January 1918 in order to address the movement for autocephaly in Ukraine.\n\n## John Dudikoff\n\nPlaton first met Father John Dudikoff sometime in 1913, over a disagreement over finances. Dudikoff followed Platon to Russia in which he accused, in his expose, of various scandals of violence within the church, including adultery, homosexuality, orgies, embezzlement, prostitution and rape. Platon was also accused of being a close advisor and friend of German ally Pavlo Skoropadsky and of instigating a pogrom while in Ukraine. Both would come to sue each other in 1923 over these accusations.\n\n## Second tenure in America\n\nDue to the advances of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War, Platon fled to America in 1919 as a refugee with his family. Facing resistance led by Father John Kedrovsky over the current bishop\'s alleged handling of church finances, Archbishop Alexander Nemolovsky in 1922 resigned and asked the Metropolitan to take over as the ruling hierarch of the diocese before leaving for Europe. On November 9 of that year he was confirmed in a sobor and established as the canonical Primate of North America; however this would be contested by Kedrovsky in later years. While serving as Archbishop of North America, Platon was pro forma retired by Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow in order to satisfy Bolshevik demands. Since Platon was already Metropolitan of Odessa, he kept this title during his second reign. Consequently, the Archdiocese of North America was elevated to Metropolia status and enjoyed a considerable amount of freedom from the Moscow Patriarchate. Metropolitan Platon inherited many new difficulties from his predecessor, such as a financial crisis and uncertainty of the future of the Moscow Patriarchate. By 1921, all funds from Russia to the North American diocese had been terminated.\n\nA second sobor was called on April 2, 1924, in Detroit, Michigan in which the North American diocese was declared "temporarily self-governing" due to difficulties in communication with the church in Russia. In later years, Platon would continue to rebuff affiliations with Russian Orthodox Church outside of Russia and the Moscow Patriarchate in order to maintain the diocese\'s independence. During his second tenure as hierarch, Platon was less amicable to movements to create a new, independent multi-ethnic church, and actively worked to undermine such efforts including any support for the newly established American Orthodox Catholic Church. Platon also faced many challenges to his own tenure; in 1925 Archbishop Adam Phillipovsky stormed Platon\'s residency with the assistance of a bomb squad from the Manhattan Police Department and physically threw the Archbishop out of the cathedral and onto the street. Phillipovsky would later be charged and arrested for contempt of court. Another threat to the diocese was Kedrovsky\'s schismatic "Living Church". Kedrovsky, who was suspended by Nemolovsky in 1918, claimed to be the true successor to the Russian Church in America by claiming he derived his authority from the Soviet Government, in contrast to Platon\'s staunch anti-Bolshevik stances. Kedrovsky would use this claim to sue over a hundred church properties. While mostly unsuccessful, he achieved a major victory in 1925 when the US courts recognized him as the legitimate owners of St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Cathedral in New York City.\n\n## Personal life and death\n\nPlaton was married in 1886. His wife gave birth to a daughter before dying in 1891; his daughter lived in Bulgaria with her family until the 1920s, where she eventually joined him in North America. On April 20, 1934, Platon died in New York, New York at the age of 68. He was buried at Saint Tikhon\'s Seminary. In 1946, Patriarch Alexy I posthumously lifted all ecclesiastical sanctions on him.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of primates of the Orthodox Church in America\n\n* 1917–18 Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church\n\n* Renovationism\n\n* White émigré\n\n## External links\n\n* Platon (Rozhdestvensky) of New York - OrthodoxWiki\n\n1866 births\n1934 deaths', 'role': 'user'}]

Platon remained there until the restoration of autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church in 1917, after of which he served as bishop of Kherson and Odessa until having to flee due to the Russian Revolution. Platon was a major participant in the All-Russian Council, and was considered as a candidate for Patriarchate of the Russian Church. During the council, Platon also suggested appointing a Greek bishop "who has studied in a Russian theological institute" in North America. During the council, Platon was also given the task of negotiating with the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. On December that year he was elected to the Holy Synod and represented a delegation in Kiev in January 1918 in order to address the movement for autocephaly in Ukraine.\n\n## John Dudikoff\n\nPlaton first met Father John Dudikoff sometime in 1913, over a disagreement over finances. Dudikoff followed Platon to Russia in which he accused, in his expose, of various scandals of violence within the church, including adultery, homosexuality, orgies, embezzlement, prostitution and rape. Platon was also accused of being a close advisor and friend of German ally Pavlo Skoropadsky and of instigating a pogrom while in Ukraine. Both would come to sue each other in 1923 over these accusations.\n\n## Second tenure in America\n\nDue to the advances of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War, Platon fled to America in 1919 as a refugee with his family. Facing resistance led by Father John Kedrovsky over the current bishop\'s alleged handling of church finances, Archbishop Alexander Nemolovsky in 1922 resigned and asked the Metropolitan to take over as the ruling hierarch of the diocese before leaving for Europe. On November 9 of that year he was confirmed in a sobor and established as the canonical Primate of North America; however this would be contested by Kedrovsky in later years. While serving as Archbishop of North America, Platon was pro forma retired by Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow in order to satisfy Bolshevik demands. Since Platon was already Metropolitan of Odessa, he kept this title during his second reign. Consequently, the Archdiocese of North America was elevated to Metropolia status and enjoyed a considerable amount of freedom from the Moscow Patriarchate. Metropolitan Platon inherited many new difficulties from his predecessor, such as a financial crisis and uncertainty of the future of the Moscow Patriarchate. By 1921, all funds from Russia to the North American diocese had been terminated.\n\nA second sobor was called on April 2, 1924, in Detroit, Michigan in which the North American diocese was declared "temporarily self-governing" due to difficulties in communication with the church in Russia. In later years, Platon would continue to rebuff affiliations with Russian Orthodox Church outside of Russia and the Moscow Patriarchate in order to maintain the diocese\'s independence. During his second tenure as hierarch, Platon was less amicable to movements to create a new, independent multi-ethnic church, and actively worked to undermine such efforts including any support for the newly established American Orthodox Catholic Church. Platon also faced many challenges to his own tenure; in 1925 Archbishop Adam Phillipovsky stormed Platon\'s residency with the assistance of a bomb squad from the Manhattan Police Department and physically threw the Archbishop out of the cathedral and onto the street. Phillipovsky would later be charged and arrested for contempt of court. Another threat to the diocese was Kedrovsky\'s schismatic "Living Church". Kedrovsky, who was suspended by Nemolovsky in 1918, claimed to be the true successor to the Russian Church in America by claiming he derived his authority from the Soviet Government, in contrast to Platon\'s staunch anti-Bolshevik stances. Kedrovsky would use this claim to sue over a hundred church properties. While mostly unsuccessful, he achieved a major victory in 1925 when the US courts recognized him as the legitimate owners of St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Cathedral in New York City.\n\n## Personal life and death\n\nPlaton was married in 1886. His wife gave birth to a daughter before dying in 1891; his daughter lived in Bulgaria with her family until the 1920s, where she eventually joined him in North America. On April 20, 1934, Platon died in New York, New York at the age of 68. He was buried at Saint Tikhon\'s Seminary. In 1946, Patriarch Alexy I posthumously lifted all ecclesiastical sanctions on him.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of primates of the Orthodox Church in America\n\n* 1917–18 Local Council of the Russian

The presidential election was won by former President José María Figueres Olsen of the National Liberation Party, who defeated Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier of the Social Christian Unity Party and Ottón Solís of the Citizens\' Action Party. Figueres\'s victory marked the first time since 1974 that an incumbent president\'s party had been re-elected.\n\n## Background\n\nThe 1990 elections were an important turning point in Costa Rican politics, marking the first time in 17 years that the ruling National Liberation Party (PLN) was not re-elected. Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier, who was elected president, was the first member of the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC) to win the presidency. The victory of the PUSC, which had been founded in 1983, was a major upset, given the PLN\'s long history of dominance in Costa Rican politics. The election was also significant because it was the first time that a party not affiliated with the PLN or the National Unification Party (PUN) had won the presidency.\n\nThe PUSC\'s victory was attributed to several factors, including voter dissatisfaction with the PLN\'s handling of the economy, corruption scandals, and the party\'s support for a market-oriented economic policy. The election was also notable for its high voter turnout, with 80.6% of eligible voters casting a ballot.\n\nThe 1990s were a period of significant political and economic change in Costa Rica. The country experienced a period of economic growth and development, but it was also marked by challenges such as debt reduction, privatization, and the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The 1990s also saw the consolidation of the PUSC as a major political force in Costa Rica, with the party winning several elections at the local and national levels.\n\nThe 1994 elections were marked by a close race between the PLN and the PUSC. The PLN\'s candidate, José María Figueres Olsen, was defeated by the PUSC\'s Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, who won with 48.6% of the vote. The election was significant because it was the first time that a woman, Epsy Campbell Barr, was elected to the Legislative Assembly.\n\nThe 1996 elections were also significant for Costa Rican politics, as they saw the return of the PLN to power. José María Figueres Olsen was elected president, marking the first time since 1974 that an incumbent president\'s party was re-elected. The election was also notable for its high voter turnout, with 80.6% of eligible voters casting a ballot. The 1990s were a period of significant political and economic change in Costa Rica, with the consolidation of the PUSC as a major political force and the PLN\'s return to power.\n\n## Campaign\n\nJosé María Figueres Olsen was the candidate for the National Liberation Party (PLN) during the 1996 election. Figueres was the son of José Figueres Ferrer, a former president of Costa Rica and a prominent figure in the country\'s political history. He had previously served as a congressman and as a minister of the presidency during the administration of his father. Figueres was a member of the PLN and was known for his pro-business and center-left political views.\n\nOttón Solís was the candidate for the Citizens\' Action Party (PAC). Solís was a lawyer and economist who had previously served as a congressman and as minister of planning and economic policy. He was known for his environmentalist views and his opposition to privatization.\n\nRafael Ángel Calderón Fournier was the candidate for the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC). Calderón was a member of the PUSC and was known for his conservative political views. He had previously served as a congressman and was a member of the Calderón family, which has a long history in Costa Rican politics.\n\nThe 1996 election was a close race, with all three candidates receiving a significant portion of the vote. In the end, José María Figueres Olsen was elected president, marking the first time since 1974 that an incumbent president\'s party was re-elected. The election was also significant for its high voter turnout, with 80.6% of eligible voters casting a ballot.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe 1996 elections were a significant moment in Costa Rican politics, marking the return of the National Liberation Party (PLN) to power after a six-year hiatus. José María Figueres Olsen\'s victory was the first time since 1974 that an incumbent president\'s party was re-elected, and it was a significant boost for the PLN, which had been facing challenges from the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC).\n\nThe election was also notable for its high voter turnout, with 80.6% of eligible voters casting a ballot. This high turnout reflected a strong interest in the political process and a desire for change.\n\nPresident Figueres\'s administration faced several challenges, including economic issues such as inflation and unemployment, as well as political scandals and corruption allegations. Despite these challenges, Figueres was able to implement some significant reforms, including changes to the tax system and public spending. He also focused on improving infrastructure and promoting tourism.\n\nThe 1990s were a period of significant political and economic change in Costa Rica. The country experienced a period of economic growth and development, but it was also marked by challenges such as debt reduction, privatization, and the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The 1990s also saw the consolidation of the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC) as a major political force in Costa Rica, with the party winning several elections at the local and national levels.\n\nOverall, the 1996 elections were a significant moment in Costa Rican politics, marking a change in leadership and a period of continued development for the country.\n\n## Further reading\n\n* Aguiluz, Ricardo.

Translation: # 1996 Costa Rican general election

General elections were held in Costa Rica on 2 February 1996. The presidential election was won by former President José María Figueres Olsen of the National Liberation Party, who defeated Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier of the Social Christian Unity Party and Ottón Solís of the Citizens' Action Party. Figueres's victory marked the first time since 1974 that an incumbent president's party had been re-elected.

## Background

The 1990 elections were an important turning point in Costa Rican politics, marking the first time in 17 years that the ruling National Liberation Party (PLN) was not re-elected. Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier, who was elected president, was the first member of the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC) to win the presidency. The victory of the PUSC, which had been founded in 1983, was a major upset, given the PLN's long history of dominance in Costa Rican politics. The election was also significant because it was the first time that a party not affiliated with the PLN or the National Unification Party (PUN) had won the presidency.

The PUSC's victory was attributed to several factors, including voter dissatisfaction with the PLN's handling of the economy, corruption scandals, and the party's support for a market-oriented economic policy. The election was also notable for its high voter turnout, with 80.6% of eligible voters casting a ballot.

The 1990s were a period of significant political and economic change in Costa Rica. The country experienced a period of economic growth and development, but it was also marked by challenges such as debt reduction, privatization, and the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The 1990s also saw the consolidation of the PUSC as a major political force in Costa Rica, with the party winning several elections at the local and national levels.

The 1994 elections were marked by a close race between the PLN and the PUSC. The PLN's candidate, José María Figueres Olsen, was defeated by the PUSC's Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, who won with 48.6% of the vote. The election was significant because it was the first time that a woman, Epsy Campbell Barr, was elected to the Legislative Assembly.

The 1996 elections were also significant for Costa Rican politics, as they saw the return of the PLN to power. José María Figueres Olsen was elected president, marking the first time since 1974 that an incumbent president's party was re-elected. The election was also notable for its high voter turnout, with 80.6% of eligible voters casting a ballot. The 1990s were a period of significant political and economic change in Costa Rica, with the consolidation of the PUSC as a major political force and the PLN's return to power.

## Campaign

José María Figueres Olsen was the candidate for the National Liberation Party (PLN) during the 1996 election. Figueres was the son of José Figueres Ferrer, a former president of Costa Rica and a prominent figure in the country's political history. He had previously served as a congressman and as a minister of the presidency during the administration of his father. Figueres was a member of the PLN and was known for his pro-business and center-left political views.

Ottón Solís was the candidate for the Citizens' Action Party (PAC). Solís was a lawyer and economist who had previously served as a congressman and as minister of planning and economic policy. He was known for his environmentalist views and his opposition to privatization.

Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier was the candidate for the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC). Calderón was a member of the PUSC and was known for his conservative political views. He had previously served as a congressman and was a member of the Calderón family, which has a long history in Costa Rican politics.

The 1996 election was a close race, with all three candidates receiving a significant portion of the vote. In the end, José María Figueres Olsen was elected president, marking the first time since 1974 that an incumbent president's party was re-elected. The election was also significant for its high voter turnout, with 80.6% of eligible voters casting a ballot.

## Aftermath

The 1996 elections were a significant moment in Costa Rican politics, marking the return of the National Liberation Party (PLN) to power after a six-year hiatus. José María Figueres Olsen's victory was the first time since 1974 that an incumbent president's party was re-elected, and it was a significant boost for the PLN, which had been facing challenges from the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC).

The election was also notable for its high voter turnout, with 80.6% of eligible voters casting a ballot. This high turnout reflected a strong interest in the political process and a desire for change.

President Figueres's administration faced several challenges, including economic issues such as inflation and unemployment, as well as political scandals and corruption allegations. Despite these challenges, Figueres was able to implement some significant reforms, including changes to the tax system and public spending. He also focused on improving infrastructure and promoting tourism.

The 1990s were a period of significant political and economic change in Costa Rica. The country experienced a period of economic growth and development, but it was also marked by challenges such as debt reduction, privatization, and the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The 1990s also saw the consolidation of the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC) as a major political force in Costa Rica, with the party winning several elections at the local and national levels.

Overall, the 1996 elections were a significant moment in Costa Rican politics, marking a change in leadership and a period of continued development for the country.

His research examines the role of Glia Maturation Factor (GMF) in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, with a focus on mechanisms associated with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). He has published in journals including Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of USA, Journal of Biological Chemistry, Journal of Neurochemistry, Brain Research, Biochemistry, Brain, Behavior, and Immunity, and Frontiers in Neuroscience.\n\n## Education\n\nZaheer completed his Bachelor's degree at Marathwada University from 1966 to 1970 and pursued a Master's degree there from 1970 to 1972. He subsequently earned his Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Bombay University (Tata Memorial Hospital, Cancer Research Institute) between 1973 and 1979.\n\n## Career\n\nFrom 1979 to 1982, Zaheer served as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Iowa, progressing to roles such as Assistant Research Scientist from 1982 to 1987, Associate Research Scientist from 1987 to 1988, and Research Scientist from 1988 to 1995. In 1995, he was appointed Associate Director, a position he held until 2004, and Adjunct Assistant Professor, serving until 2005. He also assumed the role of Adjunct Assistant Professor of Surgery in 2003, continuing until 2006.\n\nIn 2005, Zaheer took on two concurrent roles: Assistant Professor of Neurology from 2005 to 2011 and Director of Neurochemistry from 2005 to 2016. Additionally, in 2010, he joined the graduate programs in Neuroscience and Bioscience, where he remained until 2016. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2011, serving in this capacity until 2016. Since 2016, he has held the title of Emeritus Associate Professor.\n\nZaheer worked at the Veterans Affairs Health Care System, where he served as a Research Health Science Specialist from 1988 to 2016, and a Research Career Scientist at the Truman VA from 2016 to 2021. Furthermore, he was the Director of the VA Open Field Blast TBI Facility from 2018 to 2022. Simultaneously, he was a Professor and Director of the Center for Translational Neuroscience at the University of Missouri from 2016 to 2022.\n\n## Research\n\nZaheer, widely focused on the field of neuroscience, has worked on elucidating the role and mechanisms of Glia Maturation Factor (GMF) within the central nervous system, thereby contributing to the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. His research findings about GMF, a protein that plays a key role in neuroinflammation, has contributed to the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases like Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's (PD), Alzheimer's (AD), and Traumatic brain Injury (TBI). He has explored how an increased expression of GMF in cells can contribute to neuroinflammation, which in turn can activate pro-inflammatory gene expression, leading to neural damage and ultimately cause neuronal death.\n\nA considerable body of Zaheer's work has focused on understanding how GMF induction and activation in neuroglial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of brain disorders and injuries. \n\nThrough his research, he has identified GMF as a significant and less-explored factor impacting the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Highlighting the role of GMF in neuroinflammation, his studies have explored how GMF exacerbates neuron damage in neurodegenerative diseases through promoting oxidative stress and apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death that can lead to neurodegeneration. His work has also identified GMF as a modulator of various signaling pathways in the brain, thereby presenting opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Favorably modulating GMF activity or inhibiting its overexpression could potentially alleviate symptoms or slow the progression of various neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nZaheer has made contributions to other aspects of neuroscience, particularly his work related to the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying brain injuries. \\\n\n## Awards and honors\n \n\n* 1995 – Special Contribution Award, Department of Veterans Affairs\n\n* 2004-2007, 2008-2012, 2014-2018 – VA Merit Review Award, Department of Veterans Affairs\n\n* 2004-2009, 2009-2013, 2011-2016 – NIH RO1 Award, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\n\n* 2015-2020 – NIH RO1 Award, National Institute of Aging\n\n## Selected articles\n\n* Lim, R., Miller, J.

Additionally, in 2010, he joined the graduate programs in Neuroscience and Bioscience, where he remained until 2016. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2011, serving in this capacity until 2016. Since 2016, he has held the title of Emeritus Associate Professor.\n\nZaheer worked at the Veterans Affairs Health Care System, where he served as a Research Health Science Specialist from 1988 to 2016, and a Research Career Scientist at the Truman VA from 2016 to 2021. Furthermore, he was the Director of the VA Open Field Blast TBI Facility from 2018 to 2022. Simultaneously, he was a Professor and Director of the Center for Translational Neuroscience at the University of Missouri from 2016 to 2022.\n\n## Research\n\nZaheer, widely focused on the field of neuroscience, has worked on elucidating the role and mechanisms of Glia Maturation Factor (GMF) within the central nervous system, thereby contributing to the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. His research findings about GMF, a protein that plays a key role in neuroinflammation, has contributed to the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases like Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's (PD), Alzheimer's (AD), and Traumatic brain Injury (TBI). He has explored how an increased expression of GMF in cells can contribute to neuroinflammation, which in turn can activate pro-inflammatory gene expression, leading to neural damage and ultimately cause neuronal death.\n\nA considerable body of Zaheer's work has focused on understanding how GMF induction and activation in neuroglial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of brain disorders and injuries. \n\nThrough his research, he has identified GMF as a significant and less-explored factor impacting the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Highlighting the role of GMF in neuroinflammation, his studies have explored how GMF exacerbates neuron damage in neurodegenerative diseases through promoting oxidative stress and apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death that can lead to neurodegeneration. His work has also identified GMF as a modulator of various signaling pathways in the brain, thereby presenting opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Favorably modulating GMF activity or inhibiting its overexpression could potentially alleviate symptoms or slow the progression of various neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nZaheer has made contributions to other aspects of neuroscience, particularly his work related to the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying brain injuries. \\\n\n## Awards and honors\n \n\n* 1995 – Special Contribution Award, Department of Veterans Affairs\n\n* 2004-2007, 2008-2012, 2014-2018 – VA Merit Review Award, Department of Veterans Affairs\n\n* 2004-2009, 2009-2013, 2011-2016 – NIH RO1 Award, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\n\n* 2015-2020 – NIH RO1 Award, National Institute of Aging\n\n## Selected articles\n\n* Lim, R., Miller, J.

This legislation emerged from a September 2004 Cabinet decision to modernize the existing Expropriation Act of 1975.\n\n## Provisions\n\nThe legislation defines expropriation as the mandatory acquisition of property by state organs or authorized expropriating authorities. The legislation states that its primary purpose is to align South Africa\'s expropriation processes with constitutional requirements while providing clear guidelines for implementation across all levels of government. The bill intended to assist marginalized communities, including women, youth, LGBTQI+ individuals, and persons with disabilities, by facilitating improved access to services through equitable resource distribution. The bill also mentioned its necessity "in order to redress the results of past racial discriminatory laws or practices” in reference to historical apartheid practices.\n\nThe legislation grants expropriation authority to various state entities across national, provincial, and municipal levels. Ministerial powers include the ability to expropriate property for public purposes or interests, subject to specific limitations outlined in the bill. The judiciary maintains oversight through its authority to adjudicate expropriation disputes.\n\n## Property Subject to Expropriation\n\nUnder Section 25(4)(b) of the Constitution of South Africa, expropriation provisions extend beyond land to encompass both movable and immovable assets. This broad definition ensures comprehensive coverage of property types subject to potential expropriation.\n\nLegitimate expropriation must satisfy one of two fundamental criteria:\n\n Public Purpose: This encompasses activities directly related to governmental administration and service delivery, such as constructing educational institutions or healthcare infrastructure.\n Public Interest: As defined in Section 25(4)(a) of the Constitution, this includes initiatives supporting land reform and equitable access to natural resources. Section 25(8) further authorizes legislative measures to address historical racial discrimination.\n\nChapter 7 introduces mechanisms for temporary property utilization in urgent circumstances, limited to 12-month durations. However, these provisions exclude:\n\n* Properties owned by any tier of government\n\n* Assets required under the Disaster Management Act\n\n* Properties protected by judicial orders\n\nExpropriating authorities must first pursue negotiated settlements with property owners or rights holders. Direct expropriation becomes permissible only after attempts at reaching mutually acceptable terms have proven unsuccessful. This requirement is waived only in specific circumstances involving urgent temporary property usage. In cases of disagreement over expropriation matters, particularly regarding compensation, the judicial system maintained ultimate authority in determining appropriate resolutions through court proceedings.\n\n## Legislative history\n\nOn January 23, 2025, President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa provided presidential assent to the Expropriation Bill, culminating a comprehensive five-year process of deliberation beginning on 14 October 2020. His signing of the bill marked the formal replacement of the apartheid-era Expropriation Act of 1975.\n\n## Responses\n\nThe African National Congress (ANC), which initially introduced the legislation during the previous parliament, characterized it as a transformative mechanism for advancing land reform while promoting economic development and unity. The party connected the legislation to principles outlined in the Freedom Charter regarding equitable land distribution, calling it a "direct response" to "millions of South Africans who have been excluded from land ownership and access to natural resources for far too long".\n\nThe legislation\'s enactment generated significant debate regarding its democratic legitimacy, particularly given the changed parliamentary composition following recent elections. The establishment of a government of national unity, comprising multiple political parties including the ANC, Democratic Alliance, and several others, raised questions about the bill\'s potential passage under the new political arrangement. The Democratic Alliance announced intentions to contest the law\'s validity while acknowledging constitutional provisions for redress and restitution.\n\n## References\n\nSouth African legislation\nCyril Ramaphosa\nNationalization\nLand reform\n2025 in South Africa', 'role': 'user'}]

As described in a film magazine review, John Farnsworth, a wealthy man with a reputation for being stingy, is married to the lovely Helen, who is paying off a debt to him for the money that he gave her father before his death. John's niece Marjorie comes to live with them. Marjorie and her cousin Dick, who is a pilot, fall in love. When Helen finds out, she tells Marjorie that she must leave.

By the COVID-19 pandemic, its membership grew to include participants sharing experiences, advice, and golf-related resources.\n\nBy 2024, it had expanded to Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\n## Community\n\nWomen Who Golf is an online community where women exchange experiences, advice, and information.\n\nDiscussions within the community range from logistical concerns like finding local playing partners and questioning traditional "ladies\' tees," to more personal issues such as managing relationships within the sport.\n\n## References\n\nVirtual communities\nFemale golfers<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n', prompt_token_ids=[2, 2, 106, 1645, 108, 3035, 96640, 219276, 68015, 9561, 67213, 3400, 509, 8494, 593, 154549, 40456, 1925, 235265, 108, 235345, 9939, 7702, 22408, 109, 26636, 7702, 22408, 591, 22204, 235319, 235275, 603, 671, 3650, 4159, 948, 6572, 2676, 577, 4740, 3576, 235303, 235256, 16290, 575, 13162, 235265, 109, 1620, 7874, 109, 26636, 7702, 22408, 729, 18942, 575, 4456, 235248, 235284, 235276, 235274, 235315, 731, 671, 14847, 126719, 235269, 138311, 11898, 235269, 577, 9616, 8914, 140522, 235265, 11898, 20050, 611, 1070, 1997, 3281, 576, 3695, 3372, 577, 1554, 675, 9964, 140522, 3402, 577, 476, 8863, 576, 37941, 1070, 3911, 235265, 3339, 573, 8789, 235290, 235274, 235315, 14675, 235269, 1277, 18379, 14790, 577, 3707, 12612, 11766, 12219, 235269, 8111, 235269, 578, 13162, 235290, 10451, 6336, 235265, 109, 1818, 235248, 235284, 235276, 235284, 235310, 235269, 665, 1093, 21787, 577, 8625, 235269, 6591, 235269, 573, 3520, 13636, 235269, 578, 573, 3520, 3858, 235265, 109, 1620, 9553, 109, 26636, 7702, 22408, 603, 671, 3650, 4159, 1570, 3576, 10036, 12219, 235269, 8111, 235269, 578, 2113, 235265, 109, 167963, 2819, 573, 4159, 3001, 774, 148626, 10906, 1154, 10488, 2813, 6155, 8787, 578, 50401, 9121, 664, 75640, 235303, 104693, 1985, 577, 978, 3749, 5004, 1582, 685, 22496, 12733, 2819, 573, 7888, 235265, 109, 1620, 24287, 109, 28731, 11707, 108, 35715, 140522, 107, 108, 106, 2516, 108, 1], encoder_prompt=None, encoder_prompt_token_ids=None, prompt_logprobs=None, outputs=[CompletionOutput(index=0, text='# Roger Williams (disambiguation)\n\nRoger Williams (1603–1684) was an English-born founder of the colony of Rhode Island.\n\nRoger Williams may also refer to:\n\n* Roger Williams (poet) (1893–1983), English poet\n\n* Roger Williams (diplomat) (1910–1988), British diplomat\n\n* Roger Williams (pianist) (1924–2011), American jazz pianist\n\n* Roger Williams (historian) (1926–2011), British historian\n\n* Roger Williams (politician) (born 1949), American politician\n\n* Roger Williams (bishop) (born 1955), British Anglican bishop\n\n* Roger Williams (cricketer) (born 1968), English cricketer\n\n* Roger Williams (footballer), English footballer\n\n## See also\n\n* Roger Williams University, a private university in Bristol, Rhode Island\n\n* Roger Williams Park, a park in Providence, Rhode Island\n\n* Roger Williams Park Zoo', token_ids=[2, 235345, 23627, 11898, 591, 188083, 235275, 109, 39338, 11898, 591, 235274, 235318, 235276, 235304, 235389, 235274, 235318, 235321, 235310, 235275, 729, 671, 4645, 235290, 9813, 27156, 576, 573, 34623, 576, 54403, 8880, 235265, 109, 39338, 11898, 1249, 1170, 4773, 577, 235292, 109, 235287, 23627, 11898, 591, 138879, 235275, 591, 235274, 235321, 235315, 235304, 235389, 235274, 235315, 235321, 235304, 823, 4645, 12600, 109, 235287, 23627, 11898, 591, 226462, 59402, 235275, 591, 235274, 235315, 235274, 235276, 235389, 235274, 235315, 235321, 235321, 823, 7149, 94073, 109, 235287, 23627, 11898, 591, 43000, 694, 235275, 591, 235274, 235315, 235284, 235310, 235389, 235284, 235276, 235274, 235274, 823, 3725, 29169, 97588, 109, 235287, 23627, 11898, 591, 6702, 35814, 235275, 591, 235274, 235315, 235284, 235318, 235389, 235284, 235276, 235274, 235274, 823, 7149, 50234, 109, 235287, 23627, 11898, 591, 198709, 235275, 591, 9813, 235248, 235274, 235315, 235310, 235315, 823, 3725, 43504, 109, 235287, 23627, 11898, 591, 47019, 235275, 591, 9813, 235248, 235274, 235315, 235308, 235308, 823, 7149, 103678, 50322, 109, 235287, 23627, 11898, 591, 1018, 623, 2973, 235275, 591, 9813, 235248, 235274, 235315, 235318, 235321, 823, 4645, 171916, 109, 235287, 23627, 11898, 591, 43563, 475, 823, 4645, 80612, 109, 1620, 4859, 1170, 109, 235287, 23627, 11898, 2895, 235269, 476, 4765, 13435, 575, 39083, 235269, 54403, 8880, 109, 235287, 23627, 11898, 4422, 235269, 476, 7441, 575, 45100, 235269, 54403, 8880, 109, 235287, 23627, 11898, 4422, 26390, 1], cumulative_logprob=None, logprobs=None, finish_reason=stop, stop_reason=None)], finished=True, metrics=None, lora_request=None, num_cached_tokens=None, multi_modal_placeholders={})]

[{'content': "Prevedi naslednje angleško besedilo v slovenščino.\n# Lepisosteus indicus\n\nLepisosteus indicus, the Indian gar, is an extinct species of gar known from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) and early Paleocene of India. It is known from a single articulated but poorly-preserved skull and a lost set of vertebrae from the Lameta Formation, in addition to numerous isolated scales and teeth from the Lameta Formation and Intertrappean Beds.\n\n## Taxonomy\n\nIt was initially described by Woodward (1890) as a species of unrelated aspidorhynchid fish (Belonostomus indicus) until he reclassified it as a gar in 1909. L. indicus is generally thought to belong to the genus Lepisosteus, a genus that contains several modern gar species that are found in eastern North America. The presence of this species in India suggests that the genus had a much larger range in prehistoric times, and it is thought to be the easternmost known Lepisosteus species overall. However, some recent studies suggest that it may be only a stem-member of Lepisosteus, as some of the synapomorphies that were originally thought to be exclusive to Lepisosteus, and thus supporting this species' placement in that genus, have been found to be non-indicative. However, it is likely to be more closely related to Lepisosteus than to any other gar.\n\n## Occurrence\n\nAlthough only a single, crushed, partial articulated specimen is known representing an individual of about in length, the ganoid scales and teeth assigned to this species are abundant in Maastrichtian and early Paleocene freshwater deposits of India, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Telangana. \n\nIt is possible that this species or its close relatives had a wider geographic and temporal distribution: isolated gar scales (considered Lepisosteidae indet.) are known from the Kallamedu Formation of Tamil Nadu in southern India, which is contemporaneous with the Lameta Formation. In addition, the partial trunk of a small-sized gar that may potentially be L. indicus is known from the Late Paleocene-aged Palana Formation in Rajasthan, India, while isolated Lepisosteus scales are known from the middle Eocene (Lutetian)-aged Kuldana Formation of Kohat, Pakistan, representing the youngest record of gars on the subcontinent. The Pakistani Lepisosteus have been previously referred to L. indicus, but analysis of their scales indicates some differences from L. indicus, and a closer similarity to the modern longnose gar.\n\n## References\n\n†\nPrehistoric holostei\nLate Cretaceous bony fish\nCretaceous fish of Asia\nMaastrichtian life\nFossils of India\nFossil taxa described in 1890\ntaxa named by Arthur Smith Woodward", 'role': 'user'}]

The Pakistani Lepisosteus have been previously referred to L. indicus, but analysis of their scales indicates some differences from L. indicus, and a closer similarity to the modern longnose gar.\n\n## References\n\n†\nPrehistoric holostei\nLate Cretaceous bony fish\nCretaceous fish of Asia\nMaastrichtian life\nFossils of India\nFossil taxa described in 1890\ntaxa named by Arthur Smith Woodward<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", prompt_token_ids=[2, 2, 106, 1645, 108, 3035, 96640, 219276, 68015, 9561, 67213, 3400, 509, 8494, 593, 154549, 40456, 1925, 235265, 108, 235345, 629, 38050, 67541, 553, 3347, 553, 109, 235301, 38050, 67541, 553, 3347, 553, 235269, 573, 6481, 4275, 235269, 603, 671, 78561, 6202, 576, 4275, 3836, 774, 573, 28057, 92660, 591, 6354, 897, 5445, 10307, 235275, 578, 4061, 40658, 53623, 576, 5339, 235265, 1165, 603, 3836, 774, 476, 3821, 97107, 901, 34339, 235290, 171212, 26073, 578, 476, 5501, 1142, 576, 155450, 774, 573, 125653, 516, 32180, 235269, 575, 5081, 577, 12404, 9685, 25705, 578, 13900, 774, 573, 125653, 516, 32180, 578, 2353, 1383, 21189, 481, 89018, 235265, 109, 1620, 149568, 109, 1718, 729, 21166, 6547, 731, 56419, 591, 235274, 235321, 235315, 235276, 235275, 685, 476, 6202, 576, 62021, 685, 5522, 483, 119921, 539, 5001, 591, 13875, 477, 1323, 117947, 3347, 553, 235275, 3274, 693, 1587, 200929, 665, 685, 476, 4275, 575, 235248, 235274, 235315, 235276, 235315, 235265, 629, 235265, 3347, 553, 603, 7783, 3421, 577, 8070, 577, 573, 33389, 629, 38050, 67541, 553, 235269, 476, 33389, 674, 7744, 3757, 5354, 4275, 6202, 674, 708, 1942, 575, 21908, 4612, 5783, 235265, 714, 8566, 576, 736, 6202, 575, 5339, 15904, 674, 573, 33389, 1093, 476, 1683, 8107, 3001, 575, 105998, 3023, 235269, 578, 665, 603, 3421, 577, 614, 573, 21908, 3422, 3836, 629, 38050, 67541, 553, 6202, 8691, 235265, 4560, 235269, 1009, 6077, 6438, 9337, 674, 665, 1249, 614, 1297, 476, 13265, 235290, 3688, 576, 629, 38050, 67541, 553, 235269, 685, 1009, 576, 573, 86967, 19035, 3768, 484, 674, 1049, 12080, 3421, 577, 614, 15587, 577, 629, 38050, 67541, 553, 235269, 578, 6319, 15450, 736, 6202, 235303, 26792, 575, 674, 33389, 235269, 791, 1125, 1942, 577, 614, 2173, 235290, 29382, 1386, 235265, 4560, 235269, 665, 603, 5476, 577, 614, 978, 14652, 5678, 577, 629, 38050, 67541, 553, 1178, 577, 1089, 1156, 4275, 235265, 109, 1620, 138279, 109, 18626, 1297, 476, 3821, 235269, 39760, 235269, 13427, 97107, 27967, 603, 3836, 19017, 671, 3811, 576, 1105, 575, 4191, 235269, 573, 9194, 1108, 25705, 578, 13900, 15696, 577, 736, 6202, 708, 32994, 575, 3003, 897, 5445, 10307, 578, 4061, 40658, 53623, 68842, 23686, 576, 5339, 235269, 3359, 131092, 40823, 235269, 66342, 235269, 578, 152124, 235265, 235248, 109, 1718, 603, 3077, 674, 736, 6202, 689, 1277, 3387, 22631, 1093, 476, 19752, 46899, 578, 30577, 7107, 235292, 9685, 4275, 25705, 591, 113455, 629, 38050, 67541, 16690, 575, 5709, 2330, 708, 3836, 774, 573, 747, 6471, 504, 763, 32180, 576, 45686, 78550, 575, 16539, 5339, 235269, 948, 603, 216911, 675, 573, 125653, 516, 32180, 235265, 878, 5081, 235269, 573, 13427, 31540, 576, 476, 2301, 235290, 16529, 4275, 674, 1249, 21145, 614, 629, 235265, 3347, 553, 603, 3836, 774, 573, 28057, 40658, 53623, 235290, 5343, 5927, 1577, 32180, 575, 77771, 235269, 5339, 235269, 2183, 9685, 629, 38050, 67541, 553, 25705, 708, 3836, 774, 573, 7185, 169627, 591, 235301, 1714, 10307, 7817, 5343, 747, 22343, 1577, 32180, 576, 7406, 620, 235269, 18641, 235269, 19017, 573, 43340, 3661, 576, 134929, 611, 573, 1334, 88770, 235265, 714, 80032, 629, 38050, 67541, 553, 791, 1125, 10067, 13059, 577, 629, 235265, 3347, 553, 235269, 901, 4084, 576, 1024, 25705, 14939, 1009, 10216, 774, 629, 235265, 3347, 553, 235269, 578, 476, 13951, 40174, 577, 573, 5354, 1497, 39239, 4275, 235265, 109, 1620, 24287, 109, 236853, 108, 3035, 56894, 1965, 2137, 28830, 108, 41915, 92660, 118929, 5001, 108, 3415, 516, 40227, 5001, 576, 12222, 108, 6354, 897, 5445, 10307, 1913, 108, 4435, 564, 1649, 576, 5339, 108, 197067, 67619, 6547, 575, 235248, 235274, 235321, 235315, 235276, 108, 207136, 8602, 731, 18578, 7292, 56419, 107, 108, 106, 2516, 108, 1], encoder_prompt=None, encoder_prompt_token_ids=None, prompt_logprobs=None, outputs=[CompletionOutput(index=0, text="# List of awards and nominations received by Michael Keaton\n\nMichael Keaton is an American actor, producer, and director.

The bay is home to the Torpedo Bay Navy Museum.\n\n## Early History\n\nThere have been people in Torpedo Bay as early as 925 CE, as the area is believed to have been a landing point of Kupe and his waka. They spent some time in the bay and the people who were left there by Kupe when he returned to Hawaiki are considered the first settlers of New Zealand. In about 1150, Toi te Huatahi, following Kupe's directions, also landed there.

The bay is home to the Torpedo Bay Navy Museum.\n\n## Early History\n\nThere have been people in Torpedo Bay as early as 925 CE, as the area is believed to have been a landing point of Kupe and his waka. They spent some time in the bay and the people who were left there by Kupe when he returned to Hawaiki are considered the first settlers of New Zealand. In about 1150, Toi te Huatahi, following Kupe's directions, also landed there. Uika, Toi te Huatahi's grandson, also landed there, and settled permanently on North Head (Maungauika).\n\n## Early European History\n\nThe Duder Brothers owned Duder's Wharf at Torpedo Bay, where goods, including coal for their brickworks, were shipped by scow.

It was released on January 24, 2025, through Atlantic Records and Gamma.\n\n## Background and composition\n\nOn January 22, 2025, Mars thanked his fans for keeping "Die with a Smile" (2024) at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and announced that he was headed to the recording studio to "make a strip club anthem", asking Sexyy Red to join. The singer later revealed that he "found her" and shared a snippet of their upcoming song. Similar to his previous collaboration with Rosé, Mars also posted a picture of them both together.\n\n"Fat Juicy & Wet" is a "raunchy, upbeat party rap anthem" that finds Mars and Red flirting and flexing, while the latter takes it back to her roots by boasting about the "quality of her lady parts" mixed with romantic endeavors. Mars reciprocates her energy and admits to being unable to resist her. The song has been described as a crunk song that incorporates "\'80s electro funk" and is supported by a "snappy, throwback instrumental" that has been noted to be a Bruno Mars trademark, albeit an unusually "explicit" lyrical offering compared to his previous projects.\n\n## Critical reception\n\nStereogum Tom Breihan commended the song on its songcraft, production, and utilization of self-aware, silly raunchiness, writing that "the shock value is part of the fun". In contrast, Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork negatively commented on the track\'s execution of the concept together with its production.\n\n## Music video\n\nAn accompanying music video was released on January 24, 2025, and was directed by Mars himself alongside director Daniel Ramos. It features both artists against a dark red backdrop, dancing in matching pant suits with champagne bottles. They are joined by Mars\' previous collaborators Lady Gaga and Rosé, also dressed in black suits.\n\n## References\n\n2025 singles\n2025 songs\nAtlantic Records singles\nBruno Mars songs\nSexyy Red songs\nSong recordings produced by the Stereotypes\nCrunk songs\nSongs written by Bruno Mars\nSongs written by Sexyy Red', 'role': 'user'}]

shogunate of Edo period Japan, located in Hizen Province, Japan. It was centered around Kunigami Castle in what is now part of the city of Saga, Saga.\n\n## History\n\nKunigami Domain was created in 1632 when Katō Yoshihiro was transferred from Shibata Domain in Echigo Province to Kunigami. The Katō clan were fudai daimyō of the Tokugawa clan, and Yoshihiro was a grandson of Katō Yoshiaki, the founder of the clan. The new domain was located in the northwest corner of Hizen Province, and consisted of 45 villages with a population of 13,357 people in the 1633 census. The Katō clan remained at Kunigami for five generations, with the domain prospering under the capable leadership of Katō Yoshihiro\'s successor, Katō Yoshimichi (1635–1710), who was a close advisor to shōguns Tokugawa Ietsuna and Tokugawa Tsunayoshi.\n\nIn 1710, Katō Yoshimasa was transferred to Tamana Domain in Higo Province, and Kunigami Domain was transferred to Matsudaira Norishige (1692–1734), a cadet branch of the Owari-Tokugawa clan. The Matsudaira clan remained at Kunigami for seven generations.\n\nDuring the Bakumatsu period, the 8th and final daimyō of Kunigami was Matsudaira Norimasa (1830–1868), who was a proponent of sonnō jōi and supported the efforts of the imperial court to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1866, he was ordered to move the domain to Kagoshima and join forces with Satsuma Domain in order to strengthen the growing alliance between the two domains.\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Kunigami Domain became Kunigami Prefecture, and in 1871 was merged into Saga Prefecture.\n\n## Holdings at the end of the Edo period\n\nAs with most domains in the han system, Kunigami Domain consisted of several discontinuous territories calculated to provide the assigned kokudaka, based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.\n\n* Hizen Province\n\n* \n* 45 villages in Saga District\n\n## List of daimyō\n\n## See also\n\n* List of Han\n\n* Abolition of the han system\n\n## References\n\n* Bolitho, Harold.

Translation: # Kunigami Domain

was a feudal domain under the Tokugawa shogunate of Edo period Japan, located in Hizen Province, Japan. It was centered around Kunigami Castle in what is now part of the city of Saga, Saga.

## History

Kunigami Domain was created in 1632 when Katō Yoshihiro was transferred from Shibata Domain in Echigo Province to Kunigami. The Katō clan were fudai daimyō of the Tokugawa clan, and Yoshihiro was a grandson of Katō Yoshiaki, the founder of the clan. The new domain was located in the northwest corner of Hizen Province, and consisted of 45 villages with a population of 13,357 people in the 1633 census. The Katō clan remained at Kunigami for five generations, with the domain prospering under the capable leadership of Katō Yoshihiro's successor, Katō Yoshimichi (1635–1710), who was a close advisor to shōguns Tokugawa Ietsuna and Tokugawa Tsunayoshi.

In 1710, Katō Yoshimasa was transferred to Tamana Domain in Higo Province, and Kunigami Domain was transferred to Matsudaira Norishige (1692–1734), a cadet branch of the Owari-Tokugawa clan. The Matsudaira clan remained at Kunigami for seven generations.

During the Bakumatsu period, the 8th and final daimyō of Kunigami was Matsudaira Norimasa (1830–1868), who was a proponent of sonnō jōi and supported the efforts of the imperial court to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1866, he was ordered to move the domain to Kagoshima and join forces with Satsuma Domain in order to strengthen the growing alliance between the two domains.

After the Meiji Restoration, Kunigami Domain became Kunigami Prefecture, and in 1871 was merged into Saga Prefecture.

## Holdings at the end of the Edo period

As with most domains in the han system, Kunigami Domain consisted of several discontinuous territories calculated to provide the assigned kokudaka, based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.

The movement gained recognition for its involvement by millennials and the unique artwork created to spread awareness.\n\n## Background\n\nIn December 2019, a newly constituted State Wildlife Advisory Board (SWLAB) met for approximately an hour. They discussed many projects, including:\n\n* the double tracking of the existing railway line\n\n* an electricity transmission line for electricity\n\n* a highway expansion proposal\n\nAll of these would affect the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary. The projects first came into public view when a wildlife scientist wrote a cover-story in The Hindu in May 2020 that pointed out that two of these projects, the transmission line and the highway, were cleared during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. These projects would require the felling of at least 91 hectares (9,10,000 square meters) of forest. These two also did not carry out a wildlife assessment. While the transmission line had cleared a wildlife assessment, it was contradictory, since scientific consensus agrees that power transmission lines have harmful effects on wildlife.\n\nReports suggested that the highway and railway expansion would benefit the Mormugao Port Authority, which would be able to increase its coal export capabilities, favouring companies like JSW Group, Vedanta Limited and Adani Group, who export this coal.\n\nThe Mollem wildlife sanctuary is part of the Western Ghats, which have been declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The area in particular is home to 128 varieties of unique species of fauna.\n\n## 2020\n\nOn World Environment Day, 5 June 2020, a group of around 150 scientists, academics, conservationists and concerned citizens from across the country wrote to Union Minister of Forests and Environment (MoEF) Prakash Javadekar. They urged him to reconsider the approvals granted to the three projects that threatened the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary and the Mollem National Park. By this time, the number of trees to be felled were pegged at 55,000.\n\nIn the months that followed, students and activists launched online petitions to spread awareness about the issue. They also spread memes on social media, such as Instagram and Twitter. The hashtag #SaveMollem was used as a way to draw attention to the magnitude of the problem. The movement became known for its involvement of millennials. Multiple artwork was also created as part of the movement. They shared that Fridays for Future was one of their inspirations. The movement was also known as "Amche Mollem" and "My Mollem".\n\nOn 18 June, 18 scientists wrote to Forest Minister Javadekar, addressing the issue. This was followed by letters from 427 medical and nursing students on 9 July, 159 representatives from the tourism industry on 28 July, and 249 artists on 1 August.\n\nDuring the one day Goa Legislative Assembly session in July 2020, the Chief Minister of Goa, Pramod Sawant, who also holds the forest portfolio admitted that almost 70,000 trees would be cut down for the three projects. A couple of days after the Assembly session, the Leader of Opposition, Digambar Kamat, wrote to the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court stating that he was not in favour of the “dubious forest clearances” given to the three projects. He lamented that the projects were being viewed in isolation, instead of as part of Goa\'s largest protected area.\n\nOn 15 August 2020, on account of Independence Day, multiple protests were held across Goa.\n\nIn October 2020, on a visit to Goa, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar said at a press conference that he was not aware about the opposition to the three controversial linear projects proposed in and around the protected forests at the Wildlife Sanctuary. He said that he had received no written objections to the projects, despite environmental activists and other various groups from the state sending the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change dozens of written representations digitally and by post.\n\nA few days later, Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco sent a letter to the Ministry of Environment, as well as the Goa Chief Minister saying that their feigning ignorance on the protests was disturbing to Goans. He reiterated that numerous Goans including students, teachers, architects, artists, scientists, and travel and tourism operators, had written to him over four months on the issue, and that he had written to the Centre over the issue of Mollem being stripped of its green cover.\n\nAround the same time, noted Konkani writer Damodar Mauzo in a video on Mollem, urged Goans to unite and back the people of Mollem in their fight to save the forests from destruction. In the video, he also recited a poem on the ongoing struggle to save the forests penned by a Mollem local Sharaschandra Khandeparkar.\n\nOn the night of 1 November 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in India, hundreds of people sat on the railway lines passing through Chandor. The protestors included activists, members of different political parties, and citizens of different backgrounds and age groups. Six protestors were charged for unlawful assembly and rioting, despite people stating that the protest was peaceful.\n\nOn 7 December 2020, protests were held in Panjim outside the office of the Forest Department in Panaji. Other protestors marched from the Church Square to the Forest Department.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn March 2021, the MoEF granted its approval for the clearing of 140 hectares of forest land for the double-tracking project.\n\nIn April 2021, the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee (CEC) recommended against the three projects. While the double tracking project was cancelled, the transmission line was recommended to be shifted to an existing 110 KV line, and the highway expansion project was recommended to get an environmental clearance (EC) first.\n\n## Reactions\n\nResponding to the letters sent to Javadekar, CM Sawant stated, "The opposition to these projects is coming from Africa, England and Russia. Those who have not seen Goa and Mollem are now commenting about it from foreign countries." The Minister for Power in Goa, Nilesh Cabral, stated that the protestors should "first start using solar power" (before complaining about a power transmission line).\n\n## Awards and accolades\n\nThe Save Mollem campaign was recognised for the Sanctuary Wildlife Service Awards 2021 by Sanctuary Asia magazine.\n\n## References\n\n21st-century social movements\nHashtags\nSlogans\n2020 neologisms', 'role': 'user'}]

He said that he had received no written objections to the projects, despite environmental activists and other various groups from the state sending the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change dozens of written representations digitally and by post.\n\nA few days later, Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco sent a letter to the Ministry of Environment, as well as the Goa Chief Minister saying that their feigning ignorance on the protests was disturbing to Goans. He reiterated that numerous Goans including students, teachers, architects, artists, scientists, and travel and tourism operators, had written to him over four months on the issue, and that he had written to the Centre over the issue of Mollem being stripped of its green cover.\n\nAround the same time, noted Konkani writer Damodar Mauzo in a video on Mollem, urged Goans to unite and back the people of Mollem in their fight to save the forests from destruction. In the video, he also recited a poem on the ongoing struggle to save the forests penned by a Mollem local Sharaschandra Khandeparkar.\n\nOn the night of 1 November 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in India, hundreds of people sat on the railway lines passing through Chandor. The protestors included activists, members of different political parties, and citizens of different backgrounds and age groups. Six protestors were charged for unlawful assembly and rioting, despite people stating that the protest was peaceful.\n\nOn 7 December 2020, protests were held in Panjim outside the office of the Forest Department in Panaji. Other protestors marched from the Church Square to the Forest Department.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn March 2021, the MoEF granted its approval for the clearing of 140 hectares of forest land for the double-tracking project.\n\nIn April 2021, the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee (CEC) recommended against the three projects. While the double tracking project was cancelled, the transmission line was recommended to be shifted to an existing 110 KV line, and the highway expansion project was recommended to get an environmental clearance (EC) first.\n\n## Reactions\n\nResponding to the letters sent to Javadekar, CM Sawant stated, "The opposition to these projects is coming from Africa, England and Russia. Those who have not seen Goa and Mollem are now commenting about it from foreign countries." The Minister for Power in Goa, Nilesh Cabral, stated that the protestors should "first start using solar power" (before complaining about a power transmission line).\n\n## Awards and accolades\n\nThe Save Mollem campaign was recognised for the Sanctuary Wildlife Service Awards 2021 by Sanctuary Asia magazine.\n\n## References\n\n21st-century social movements\nHashtags\nSlogans\n2020

National League 2 South\n\nThe 2010–11 National League 2 South was the seventh season (26th overall) of the fourth tier (south) of the English domestic rugby union competitions since the professionalised format of the second division was introduced. The league system was expanded to include a northern division for the first time and the two divisions were effectively created by splitting National Division 3 into two. The champions of the northern and southern divisions would be promoted to National League 1, whilst the bottom three teams in each division would be relegated to either Regional 1 South East, Regional 1 South West, Regional 1 Midlands or Regional 1 North.\n\nThe title was won by a dominant Redruth who finished 11 points ahead of closest rivals, Westcombe Park, and were promoted to National League 1 for the first time in their history. At the other end of the table, two of the relegated teams – Salisbury and Southend Saxons – had only been promoted the previous season from the regional leagues, whilst Southend Saxons had only been formed in 2009.\n\n## Round 12\n\n* Postponed due to waterlogged pitch.

Translation: # 2010–11 National League 2 South

The 2010–11 National League 2 South was the seventh season (26th overall) of the fourth tier (south) of the English domestic rugby union competitions since the professionalised format of the second division was introduced. The league system was expanded to include a northern division for the first time and the two divisions were effectively created by splitting National Division 3 into two. The champions of the northern and southern divisions would be promoted to National League 1, whilst the bottom three teams in each division would be relegated to either Regional 1 South East, Regional 1 South West, Regional 1 Midlands or Regional 1 North.

The title was won by a dominant Redruth who finished 11 points ahead of closest rivals, Westcombe Park, and were promoted to National League 1 for the first time in their history. At the other end of the table, two of the relegated teams – Salisbury and Southend Saxons – had only been promoted the previous season from the regional leagues, whilst Southend Saxons had only been formed in 2009.

[{'content': 'Prevedi naslednje angleško besedilo v slovenščino.\n# Vivre Libre ou Mourir\n\n"Vivre Libre ou Mourir" was a motto of the French Revolution. It was notably the motto of the Society of Friends of the Constitution, better known as the Jacobins and of the Battalion of the Filles-Saint-Thomas of the National Guard from September 1789. It also appears at the top of the Journal d\'État et du citoyen written and edited by Louise-Félicité de Kéralio in August 1789, whose father was the commander of the Battalion of the Filles-Saint-Thomas. In her famous work published in 1791, Les crimes des reines de France depuis le commencement de la monarchie jusqu\'à Marie-Antoinette, Louise-Félicité de Kéralio concludes with the being who has sworn to live free or die, and makes fun of the anger of tyrants.\n\nThe anecdote tells that after the flight to Varennes, in the carriage which was bringing the royal family back to Paris, the Dauphin deciphered the motto engraved on the buttons of the deputy Antoine Barnave.\n\nIt was taken up by Camille Desmoulins for his newspaper Le Vieux Cordelier from 1793 to 1794.\n\nIt is engraved on the central monument of the Panthéon in Paris representing the National Convention.\n\nIt is also the official motto of the state of New Hampshire ("Live Free or Die"), adopted by the state in 1945.\n\nThe formula was taken up by Louis Delgrès and his companions, anti-slavery, before their suicide in Matouba in Guadeloupe in 1802.\n\nThe phrase is also found in a note written on July 31, 1809, by General John Stark, New Hampshire\'s most famous soldier of the American Revolutionary War. His poor health forced him to decline an invitation to a commemoration of the Battle of Bennington, so he sent his note by letter:\n\n Live free or die: Death is not the worst of evils.\n\nHowever, the authorship of the motto can be disputed with Stark, the line "We must be free or die" is used by the English romantic poet William Wordsworth, in his poem "It is not to be Thought of", close to the French republicans and written during the French Revolution.\n\nThe motto was adopted at the same time as the New Hampshire emblem on which it appears.\n\nThis motto was then probably taken up again during the Franco-Prussian War. It appears in particular on the monument to the Savoyards who died for France located in Annecy in Haute-Savoie, at the crossroads of the avenue de Genève and the rue de l\'Intendance.\n\nFinally, this motto was that of the resistance fighters of the Maquis des Glières.\n\nDuring the winter of 1944, a group of resistance fighters from the Secret Army, made up of soldiers and resistance fighters and joined by Spanish Republicans and then FTP, went up to the Glières plateau to receive parachute drops of weapons and stayed there for two months. It was Alphonse Métral - who, a few years earlier, passed the war memorial of 1870-1871 every day on his way to work - who suggested this motto to Tom Morel, leader of the Maquis des Glières, which was immediately adopted.\n\nThis motto is also the title of a song by the group Bérurier Noir.\n\nIt is also the official motto of Uruguay. In 1825, it was adopted by the "Thirty-three Orientals", the revolutionary group that fought for independence from Brazil. Since 1952, the motto has appeared on one of the three official flags of Uruguay, the flag of the Thirty-Three.\n\n## See also\n\n* La liberté ou la mort\n\n* Live Free or Die\n\n* Elefthería í thánatos\n\n## External links\n\n* Objects bearing the motto Live Free or Die in the collections of Paris museums\n\nKingdom of France\nFrench words and phrases\nNational mottos\nFrench political catchphrases\nFrench Revolution', 'role': 'user'}]

He was a member of the Yale\'s 1934 "Ironmen" football team that upset an undefeated Princeton team.\n\n## Early life\n\nDeAngelis was born in Hamden, Connecticut. His father was a bricklayer and stonemason and his mother was a factory worker. After graduating from Hillhouse High School, DeAngelis worked for a local telephone company until Clarence Blakeslee, the head of a New Haven construction company, paid for his tuition to the Milford Academy. He then attended Yale University, where he was a member of the football and basketball teams. He played center and linebacker for the 1934 Yale Bulldogs football team, which upset Princeton 7–0. DeAngelis had two key tackles in the game; stopping Ken Sandbach at the two-yard line on the opening kickoff and tackling Homer Spofford 2 yards short of the end zone during the first of four goal-line stands. He graduated from Yale in 1935 with a bachelor of science degree.\n\n## Coaching\n\nFrom 1935 to 1937, DeAngelis was Yale\'s freshman football coach. In 1938, he became the team\'s junior varsity coach. In 1941, DeAngelis followed Yale head coach Ducky Pond to Bates College. In addition to serving as an assistant football coach, DeAngelis was also the school\'s head basketball coach and freshman baseball coach. In 1942, DeAngelis left Bates to enter the United States Navy. He was commissioned as a lieutenant junior grade and assigned to the University of North Carolina, where he worked as a physical fitness instructor of aviation cadets.\n\nAfter the war, DeAngelis resumed his coaching career at Yale. He was freshman coach from 1945 to 1947 and assistant varsity coach in 1948. In 1948, was the line coach for the Toledo Rockets football team. The following season, he took the same position with the Nebraska Cornhuskers. In 1950, he joined the staff of former Yale head coach Howie Odell at the University of Washington.\n\n## Later life\n\nIn 1953, DeAngelis returned to Connecticut, where he worked as a sales manager. He retired in 1991 and spent the last decade of his life living in a retirement community in Wallingford, Connecticut. He died on December 26, 2007 at the age of 97.\n\n## References\n\n1910 births\n2007 deaths\nBates Bobcats football coaches\nBates Bobcats men\'s basketball coaches\nHillhouse High School alumni\nMilford Academy alumni\nNebraska Cornhuskers football coaches\nPlayers of American football from New Haven, Connecticut\nToledo Rockets football coaches\nUnited States Navy personnel of World War II\nWashington Huskies football coaches\nYale Bulldogs football coaches\nYale Bulldogs football players\nYale Bulldogs men\'s basketball players', 'role': 'user'}]

The Sikri dynasty was an offshoot of the house of Sikar, at Rajasthan from where Sikarwar Rajputs derive there name. Sikarwars are a relative clan of Shekhawati rajputs of Suryavanshi race. The city of Sikri, was the original city from where the sikarwar here ruled, but later, they made many other capitals. The village of Sikri, was later renamed by Akbar when he rebuild the old city and kept it\'s name Fatehpur Sikri. In its starting years, the rulers of Sikri had small territories, though a rich history having title of Raja, it was during the time of Rao Anup Dev Singh Sikarwar when, the rulers their strong hold in the region, gaining a title of Maharaja. At its zenith the rule of dynasty \'s rulers was spread over, what are now the regions of, Gwalior, Morena , Jhansi, Shivpuri, Karauli, Dholpur, and Fatehpur Sikri.\n\n## Founding and Early Rule\n\nThe Sikarwars established Vijaypur Sikri as a bastion of Rajput valor and governance. A total of 32 generations had ruled over Sikri, from Raja Hem Chand to Dham Dev and Kam Dev. During the reign of Rao Dham Dev Sikarwar, a pivotal figure in the dynasty, Sikri played a prominent role in resisting external aggression. Rao Dham Dev was crowned in 1504 AD, in a ceremony graced by Rana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga), who was then the prince of Mewar. A devout worshipper of Mata Kamakhaya, Dham Dev fortified Sikri as a center of Rajput resistance against the rising Mughal threat.\n\nThe dynasty\'s earlier rulers, such as Salik Dev Sikarwar, had expanded their influence, aiding prominent Rajput leaders like Rana Rahup in battles against rivals, including Mukul Parihar. Ganga Dev Sikarwar, a revered warrior, famously orchestrated the "Battle of Letters" against Alauddin Khilji in 1303 AD. Though he fell in the defense of Chittor, his legacy of honor and resistance against invaders endured.\n\nDuring the 15th century, Sikri underwent significant renovations under the patronage of Anup Dev Sikarwar. Inspired by the architectural grandeur of Mathura and Dwarika, the fort and palaces of Sikri were transformed into symbols of Rajput artistic excellence. Anup Dev\'s efforts were supported by Rana Kumbha, who provided skilled artisans and materials. The fort\'s completion in 1423 AD marked the zenith of Sikarwar prosperity, and the famous Anup Tal still stands as a testament to this era.\n\nRao Anup Dev Sikarwar, had two sons Kishun and Pratap Dev Sikarwar. Kishun Dev too had two sons Jay Raj Dev and Vijay Raj Dev. Pratap Dev had only one- Udai Raj, while, the three sons of Jayraj Dev of Sikri were Viram, Dham and Kam Dev. Kam Dev was the eldest, Viram Pratap the youngest.\n\n## The Battle of Khanwa and the Fall of Sikri\n\nThe Sikri dynasty reached a crucial juncture during the Battle of Khanwa in 1527 AD. Rao Dham Dev Sikarwar, a trusted ally of Rana Sanga, led the Sikarwar cavalry in a surprise attack on Babur\'s advance column near Sikri. Utilizing the cover of the Sikri Ridge, Dham Dev\'s forces inflicted significant damage, demoralizing the Mughal troops. This cavalry charge remains a celebrated example of Rajput valor.\n\nDespite their efforts, the Rajput confederacy suffered a decisive defeat. The night battle that ensued within Sikri fort saw heavy Mughal casualties, but the Rajputs eventually withdrew to protect their families and religious sanctity. Sikri fell into Mughal hands, and Babur renamed it "Fatehpur Sikri," marking a turning point in Indian history.\nThe history of the Sikri dynasty, particularly the stories of Rao Dham Dev and Kam Dev, is rich in valor and strategic brilliance. These two leaders not only epitomized the resilience of the Sikarwar Rajputs but also left an enduring legacy through their alliances, military achievements, and the preservation of their lineage amidst turbulent times. Below is a more detailed account of the two brothers and their impact on the Sikri dynasty.\n\nThe Sabalgarh fort once served as the centre of administration during the rule of Kam Dev\n\n## Rao Kam Dev Sikarwar (1438–1532)\n\nRao Kam Dev Singh Sikarwar, often referred to as Dalpat Karam Singh in some records, was the eldest son of Maharaja Jay Raj Dev Singh, the ruler of Vijaypur Sikri. Known for his military acumen, Kam Dev played a pivotal role in consolidating Sikarwar influence over regions that now encompass Morena, Gwalior, Jhansi, and Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nKam Dev embarked on a campaign to expand the Sikarwar territory, subduing Muslim tribes like the Cheras in Madhya Pradesh. His conquest of these regions established a strong Rajput presence in areas such as Morena and Pahargarh. These expansions were not only territorial but also strategic, as they served to fortify Sikarwar influence and resist Mughal incursions in central India.\n\n## Migration to Morena and Pahargarh\n\nAfter his campaigns, Kam Dev\'s descendants and forces settled in Morena and nearby regions, where they continued to hold sway. Their influence in these areas remains notable, with Sikarwar Rajputs still being recognized as significant landholders and protectors of Rajput traditions. Kam Dev\'s leadership helped preserve Rajput values and cultural practices in these new territories.\n\n## Rao Dham Dev Sikarwar (r. 1504–1527)\n\nRao Dham Dev, Kam Dev\'s younger brother, became the ruler of Vijaypur Sikri in 1504 AD. A staunch ally and close friend of Rana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) of Mewar, Dham Dev was instrumental in the Rajput confederacy that opposed the Mughal invasion. His reign was marked by strong leadership, strategic foresight, and devotion to the Sikarwar deity, Mata Kamakhaya.\n\n## The Battle of Khanwa (1527)\n\nRao Dham Dev\'s role in the Battle of Khanwa is legendary. As a trusted commander in Rana Sanga\'s Rajput confederation, he led a cavalry charge against Babur\'s forces. This surprise attack targeted Babur\'s advance column as it moved from Sikri to Khanwa, catching the Mughals off-guard and causing significant casualties.\n\nDespite their valor, the Rajput forces, weakened by internal betrayals and Babur\'s advanced artillery, lost the battle. Following this, the Mughals besieged Sikri Fort, which had served as a strategic base for the Rajput army. Rao Dham Dev led a disciplined withdrawal from the fort, ensuring the safe evacuation of Rana Sanga, who was severely wounded, and the sacred idol of Mata Kamakhaya.\n\n## Night Battle of Sikri\n\nEven after the fall of Sikri Fort, Dham Dev continued to resist. In a fierce night battle, his forces inflicted heavy losses on the Mughal troops pursuing the retreating Rajputs. The disciplined fighting withdrawal under his command showcased his military brilliance and dedication to the Rajput cause.\n\n## Battle of Madarpur\n\nThe battle of Madarpur was fought between mir Baqi and combined armies of Bhumihar and Rajputs, lead by Dham Dev and Anchal Dev (son of Kam Dev) in 1530 after which they migrated further to Ghazipur district. Although a large amount of Sikarwars can be found in the Morena and it\'s nearby districts, who are the descendants from other ruler of the dynasty rather than Kam Dev and Dham Dev.\n\n## The Aftermath and Migration\n\nThe fall of Sikri marked a turning point for the Sikarwar Rajputs. To protect their families, and cultural heritage from Mughal persecution, the dynasty migrated to densely forested areas of Ghazipur and Kaimur district, where Kam Dev and Dham Dev descendants established their won estates in present-day states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. One of their most notable estates being, Dildarnagar Kamsar established by a desedents of Kam Dev named as Raja Narhar Khan, who adopted Islam in 1542 and became Narhar Khan, the other being the estates of Reotipur , Gahmar, Sherpur, and Bhabua.

This alliance further cemented their reputation as warriors who resisted Mughal dominance while upholding Rajput traditions.\n\n## The Legacy of the Sikri Dynasty\n\nThe history of the Sikri dynasty, from its founding in 823 AD to its migration after 1527 AD, is a testament to the resilience and valor of the Sikarwar Rajputs.

He is also author of reportage books and creator of the program Bez Maski (Without Mask) on YouTube.\n\n## Controversy\n\nPiotr Krysiak is the author of controversial publications about people from the Polish show business. His work has often caused negative reactions. Edyta Górniak sued him for his unauthorized biography Edyta Górniak: Uncensored. The singer claimed that the content of the book is untrue and violates her personal rights. In 2009, the District Court in Warsaw banned the distribution of the publication and ordered the defendant to issue an apology and pay money to a charitable foundation. The Court of Appeal ruled that the sentence is legally binding.\n\nKrysiak was also sued by Omenaa Mensah for violating her personal rights in connection with the publication of The Girl from Dubai. She demanded to block the sale of the book.

He is also author of reportage books and creator of the program Bez Maski (Without Mask) on YouTube.\n\n## Controversy\n\nPiotr Krysiak is the author of controversial publications about people from the Polish show business. His work has often caused negative reactions. Edyta Górniak sued him for his unauthorized biography Edyta Górniak: Uncensored. The singer claimed that the content of the book is untrue and violates her personal rights. In 2009, the District Court in Warsaw banned the distribution of the publication and ordered the defendant to issue an apology and pay money to a charitable foundation. The Court of Appeal ruled that the sentence is legally binding.\n\nKrysiak was also sued by Omenaa Mensah for violating her personal rights in connection with the publication of The Girl from Dubai. She demanded to block the sale of the book. In November 2023 the District Court in Warsaw imposed a ban on him from speaking about the presenter.\n\nAs reported by the Salon 24 website, Piotr Krysiak is hounded by bailiff.\n\n## Books\n\n* 2005: Edyta Górniak.

It was introduced in 1957.\n\nEPTC can be applied pre-emergently or post-emergently and its effectiveness does not depend on post-application rainfall. The herbicide takes effect quickly after application. It is registered in every US state. It should be sprayed when the soil is well worked and dry, to allow good mixing and incorporation.

It is typically sold as an emulsifiable concentrate, of 70% of more s-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate, or as granules.\n\nIn the United States, EPTC is registered for use on alfalfa, almonds, beans, birdsfoot trefoil, clovers, lespedeza, sainfoin, citrus nursery stock and plantings, cotton, grass, fallow, pine seedlings, potatoes, safflower, sugar beets, sunflower, tomatoes and walnuts.\n\nIn Australia, EPTC is used on beans, potatoes, maize, sweet corn, safflower, rapeseed, sunflower, lucerne, duboisia, lotus, non-crop situations and grass.\n\nIt has been sold under the tradenames Eradicane, Eptam, Genep and Shortstop.

More specifically, Dehan speakers \nare mainly found in ten villages in the eastern part of Barak river namely Horinagar, Japirbon, Leburbon, Gororbon, Dewan (Labok) or Dewan Bosti, Narayanpur, Larchingpar, Thaligram, Lakkhichora, and Digli. Though Dehan speakers are located in the same district, however, they are scattered in different places. Out of ten villages, Japirbon is the \nbiggest and the populous one.\n\nOther than Assamese, Dehan shares its lexical items and linguistic features with Sylheti and Bishnupriya Manipuri as well, which is due to long language contact apart from being closely related. Dehan is closely related to the Kamrupi and Standard dialects of Assamese.\n\n## History\n\nAmong the communities of Barak valley, the Dehans are one of the early settlers as their settlement dates back to 16th century. They are migrants from Brahmaputra valley. They entered Cachar during Chilarai’s conquest of Cachar plains, but some of them didn't return to Brahmaputra valley and made Cachar their permanent home. Chilarai campaigned through Maibong, Manipur, Jaintia, Srihatta and Tripura and finally the plains of Cachar were annexed to the Koch kingdom in 1562. Later the Koch principality in Cachar was reduced to a small zamindari in and around Khaspur.\n\nThe Koch-Rajbongshis of Barak valley are better known as Dehans. They initially had their settlements around Khaspur but later, owning to different socio-political compulsions, they had to branch off to different villages.\n\n## Reference\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\nEastern Indo-Aryan languages\nLanguages of Assam\nAssamese language", 'role': 'user'}]

They initially had their settlements around Khaspur but later, owning to different socio-political compulsions, they had to branch off to different villages.\n\n## Reference\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\nEastern Indo-Aryan languages\nLanguages of Assam\nAssamese language<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", prompt_token_ids=[2, 2, 106, 1645, 108, 3035, 96640, 219276, 68015, 9561, 67213, 3400, 509, 8494, 593, 154549, 40456, 1925, 235265, 108, 235345, 1302, 2990, 73203, 109, 1680, 2990, 235269, 131849, 235269, 608, 480, 6487, 235269, 608, 544, 6487, 689, 145021, 1050, 73203, 603, 476, 12363, 8080, 576, 3500, 113872, 235269, 22230, 13791, 575, 573, 145021, 486, 9220, 576, 218531, 20309, 235265, 3696, 14076, 235269, 1302, 2990, 22660, 235248, 108, 895, 13791, 1942, 575, 2797, 25435, 575, 573, 21908, 1702, 576, 218531, 8540, 24435, 8309, 473, 33768, 235269, 30924, 616, 3839, 235269, 14336, 525, 3839, 235269, 24521, 483, 3839, 235269, 131849, 591, 11075, 1124, 235275, 689, 131849, 17765, 487, 235269, 151396, 9952, 235269, 629, 121136, 964, 235269, 95701, 148260, 235269, 36546, 235273, 4440, 2216, 235269, 578, 9061, 515, 235265, 14861, 1302, 2990, 22660, 708, 7023, 575, 573, 1809, 9220, 235269, 4187, 235269, 984, 708, 30390, 575, 2167, 6853, 235265, 4543, 576, 2797, 25435, 235269, 30924, 616, 3839, 603, 573, 235248, 108, 127169, 578, 573, 137695, 974, 235265, 109, 6273, 1178, 3500, 113872, 235269, 1302, 2990, 14324, 1277, 119295, 5100, 578, 61369, 5119, 675, 25733, 174501, 578, 171541, 6144, 960, 2194, 73199, 3068, 685, 1578, 235269, 948, 603, 3402, 577, 1497, 5255, 3764, 10392, 774, 1855, 14652, 5678, 235265, 1302, 2990, 603, 14652, 5678, 577, 573, 15163, 820, 2157, 578, 11462, 124653, 576, 3500, 113872, 235265, 109, 1620, 7874, 109, 36637, 573, 11707, 576, 218531, 20309, 235269, 573, 1302, 76287, 708, 974, 576, 573, 4061, 57710, 685, 1024, 19559, 12411, 1355, 577, 235248, 235274, 235318, 489, 7861, 235265, 2365, 708, 54766, 774, 120284, 168217, 20309, 235265, 2365, 10783, 145021, 486, 2290, 1074, 3081, 1515, 235349, 235256, 63705, 576, 145021, 486, 52303, 235269, 901, 1009, 576, 1174, 3528, 235303, 235251, 2203, 577, 120284, 168217, 20309, 578, 1644, 145021, 486, 1024, 14151, 2078, 235265, 1074, 3081, 1515, 217317, 1593, 3003, 1207, 808, 235269, 195408, 235269, 68397, 9437, 235269, 21744, 230277, 578, 233799, 578, 6247, 573, 52303, 576, 145021, 486, 1049, 96359, 577, 573, 45769, 20113, 575, 235248, 235274, 235308, 235318, 235284, 235265, 23988, 573, 45769, 4263, 2150, 575, 145021, 486, 729, 9673, 577, 476, 2301, 23558, 134977, 575, 578, 2449, 134944, 9952, 235265, 109, 651, 45769, 235290, 43903, 81412, 1726, 502, 576, 218531, 20309, 708, 2525, 3836, 685, 1302, 76287, 235265, 2365, 21166, 1093, 1024, 50163, 2449, 134944, 9952, 901, 3416, 235269, 62121, 577, 2167, 19045, 235290, 47130, 942, 83501, 235269, 984, 1093, 577, 12832, 1401, 577, 2167, 25435, 235265, 109, 1620, 18833, 109, 235287, 235248, 109, 235287, 235248, 109, 235287, 235248, 109, 235287, 235248, 109, 235287, 235248, 109, 63289, 64554, 235290, 235280, 35453, 17044, 108, 60172, 576, 79166, 108, 4957, 113872, 5255, 107, 108, 106, 2516, 108, 1], encoder_prompt=None, encoder_prompt_token_ids=None, prompt_logprobs=None, outputs=[CompletionOutput(index=0, text="# 1995 U.S. Figure Skating Championships\n\nThe 1995 U.S. Figure Skating Championships took place from January 10 to 15, 1995 at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island.

Korea had ended its period of isolation several decades before, after it was forcefully opened by Japan. The Korean government leased a significant portion of land north of Namsan, free of charge, to the Japanese residents for the construction of the park. Construction began on it in either 1908 or 1909, and the park officially opened on May 29, 1910. The former Korean monarch Gojong (whom had been forced to abdicate in lieu of his son) selected the name of the park. Its opening ceremony was attended by around 2,000 people. To commemorate the park's opening, he personally engraved the name of the park on a stone monument; this monument was erected at the entrance to the park in 1912. It is not known whether Gojong had performed this engraving by choice. Months after the opening of the park, Japan formally annexed Korea.\n\nOn July 18, 1919, it was decided that the park would be closed to make way for Chōsen Shrine, which was to be the main Shinto shrine in Korea. Its facilities were almost all destroyed during the construction process. The park was still attested to in a 1928 listing of parks in the city. However, it was not listed in a 1940 listing.\n\n## Stone monument\n\nThe stone monument was moved elsewhere during the demolition process. It eventually ended up around the entrance of what would become Namsan Tunnel No. 3. During the tunnel construction process, it was possibly moved again to another resting point nearby. In 2002, it was discovered lying in the grass behind a fence. In 2009, it was restored and made into a public exhibit.\n\nThe stone monument is of size . It was placed on a granite pedestal of the dimensions . On the front is inscribed the name of the park in Hanja. It had an inscription on the back; by the time of its rediscovery, the inscription was nearly illegible. Its message is now known from old photographs. Three square stone pillars surrounded the monument. There are possibly bullet marks in the stone; these may be from the 1950–1953 Korean War.\n\nThe monument has been described as an unpleasant but important reminder of the colonial period. It is not classified in South Korea's national heritage system; instead it was given the Seoul Future Heritage designation, which is administered by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. This is reflective of the monument's association with a Japanese institution in the country. In 2017, the monument became one stop along the Trail of National Humiliation, which walks between various former sites of Japanese institutions near Namsan.\n\n## External links\n\n1910 establishments in Korea\nKeijō\n1910s disestablishments in Korea\nNamsan", 'role': 'user'}]
