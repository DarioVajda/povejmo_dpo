# 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests

On 12 November, the Hong Kong government announced that it would ban face masks in public assemblies, citing the need to maintain public order. The ban was met with widespread condemnation from the international community, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. The ban was also criticised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, who said that it "raises serious concerns about the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly".

On 18 November, the Hong Kong government announced that it would postpone the implementation of the mask ban, citing the need to "cool down the situation". The ban was eventually implemented on 4 October 2020.

## 2020

On 1 January 2020, thousands of protesters gathered in Victoria Park to mark the start of the new year and the first anniversary of the protests. The protest was largely peaceful, with protesters chanting slogans and waving flags.

On 1 February 2020, the Hong Kong government announced that it would be introducing a new national security law. The law was met with widespread opposition from the protesters, who saw it as a threat to their freedoms.

On 27 June 2020, the Hong Kong government passed the national security law. The law criminalises acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces. The law has been widely criticised by the international community, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.

On 1 August 2020, the Hong Kong government announced that it would be banning the display of the British colonial flag and the colonial emblem. The ban was met with widespread condemnation from the protesters, who saw it as a further erosion of their freedoms.

## Aftermath

The 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests had a profound impact on Hong Kong society. The protests led to a decline in tourism, a drop in retail sales, and a decrease in foreign investment. The protests also had a chilling effect on freedom of expression and assembly in Hong Kong.

The protests also had a significant impact on the relationship between Hong Kong and China. The Chinese government saw the protests as a threat to its sovereignty and stability. In response, the Chinese government passed a national security law in Hong Kong. The law has been widely criticised by the international community, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.

The 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests were a watershed moment in Hong Kong's history. They demonstrated the resilience of the people of Hong Kong and their commitment to democracy and freedom. The protests also highlighted the deep divisions that exist in Hong Kong society.

# 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests

The 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests were a series of pro-democracy demonstrations and civil unrest that took place in Hong Kong from 2019 to 2020. The protests were sparked by the introduction of the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China for trial. The bill was widely seen as a threat to the "one country, two systems" principle and the city's judicial independence.

The protests began on 9 June 2019, with a peaceful march that attracted over a million participants, the largest demonstration in Hong Kong's history. The protests escalated into a series of increasingly violent confrontations between protesters and the police, with protesters occupying major roads and public spaces, and the police responding with tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons. The protests were marked by a high level of public participation, with many ordinary citizens joining the demonstrations, and a significant degree of international attention and support.

The protests were also notable for their use of innovative tactics, such as the use of laser pointers to disorient police officers and the creation of "flash mobs" to evade police surveillance. The protests were also marked by a high degree of organization and coordination, with protesters using social media platforms such as Telegram and LIHKG to plan and communicate their actions.

The protests were met with a variety of responses from the Hong Kong government and the Chinese government. The Hong Kong government initially responded with a hardline stance, refusing to meet the protesters' demands and accusing them of being rioters. The Chinese government also took a hardline stance, accusing the protesters of being separatists and terrorists.

Despite the protests, the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 was passed by the Hong Kong Legislative Council on 18 June 2019. The bill was signed into law by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam on 30 June 2019.

The protests continued into 2020, with a series of smaller demonstrations and civil disobedience actions taking place throughout the year. The protests were eventually suppressed by the Hong Kong government, with the help of the Chinese government, in the form of a national security law that was passed in June 2020. The law criminalized a number of activities, including secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces, and gave the government broad powers to suppress dissent.

The 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests were a significant event in the history of Hong Kong, and they had a profound impact on the city's politics and society. The protests were a testament to the resilience and determination of the people of Hong Kong, and they highlighted the importance of the "one country, two systems" principle.

## Background

The protests were sparked by the introduction of the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China for trial. The bill was widely seen as a threat to the "one country, two systems" principle and the city's judicial independence.

The protests were also fueled by a number of other grievances, including:

* The erosion of civil liberties and freedoms in Hong Kong.

* The high cost of living in Hong Kong.

* The lack of affordable housing.

* The perceived corruption of the Hong Kong government.

* The lack of democracy in Hong Kong.

The protests were a continuation of a series of pro-democracy protests that had been taking place in Hong Kong since the Umbrella Revolution in 2014. The Umbrella Revolution was a series of protests that were also sparked by the perceived erosion of civil liberties and freedoms in Hong Kong.

## Timeline

The protests began on 9 June 2019, with a peaceful march that attracted over a million participants, the largest demonstration in Hong Kong's history. The protests escalated into a series of increasingly violent confrontations between protesters and the police, with protesters occupying major roads and public spaces, and the police responding with tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons.

The protests were marked by a high level of public participation, with many ordinary citizens joining the demonstrations, and a significant degree of international attention and support. The protests were also notable for their use of innovative tactics, such as the use of laser pointers to disorient police officers and the creation of "flash mobs" to evade police surveillance. The protests were also marked by a high degree of organization and coordination, with protesters using social media platforms such as Telegram and LIHKG to plan and communicate their actions.

The protests were met with a variety of responses from the Hong Kong government and the Chinese government. The Hong Kong government initially responded with a hardline stance, refusing to meet the protesters' demands and accusing them of being rioters. The Chinese government also took a hardline stance, accusing the protesters of being separatists and terrorists.

Despite the protests, the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 was passed by the Hong Kong Legislative Council on 18 June 2019. The bill was signed into law by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam on 30 June 2019.

The protests continued into 2020, with a series of smaller demonstrations and civil disobedience actions taking place throughout the year. The protests were eventually suppressed by the Hong Kong government, with the help of the Chinese government, in the form of a national security law that was passed in June 2020. The law criminalized a number of activities, including secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces, and gave the government broad powers to suppress dissent.

## Impact

The 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests were a significant event in the history of Hong Kong, and they had a profound impact on the city's politics and society. The protests were a testament to the resilience and determination of the people of Hong Kong, and they highlighted the importance of the "one country, two systems" principle.

The protests also had a number of other impacts, including:

* The erosion of trust between the Hong Kong government and the people of Hong Kong.

* The increase in political polarization in Hong Kong.

* The decline of Hong Kong's international reputation.

* The impact on Hong Kong's economy.

The protests were a reminder of the importance of democracy and civil liberties, and they showed that the people of Hong Kong are willing to fight for their rights. The protests also showed that the "one country, two systems" principle is under threat, and that the Chinese government is willing to use force to suppress dissent.

Azzijevo delo se osredotoča na biokemijo encimov, gensko regulacijo in presnovo, s poudarkom na vitaminu E (alfa-tokoferolu), antioksidantih in signalnih poteh, ki vključujejo protein kinazo C in diacilglicerol kinazo. Prejel je več nagrad, vključno z nagrado Vitamin Prize leta 2002 od Društva za uporabno raziskovanje vitaminov, nagrado za življenjsko delo od Društva za proste radikale leta 2014, nagrado za izjemne zasluge Mednarodne zveze za biokemijo in molekularno biologijo leta 2016 in nagrado Nencki od Inštituta Nencki za eksperimentalno biologijo leta 2016.

Azzi je tuji član Poljske akademije znanosti in je tudi dosmrtni častni član Oxygen Cluba iz Kalifornije. Ima tudi uredniške vloge, vključno z vlogo glavnega urednika revij Molecular Aspects of Medicine in Aspects of Molecular Medicine.

## Izobraževanje in kariera

Azzi je leta 1963 diplomiral na Univerzi v Padovi, nato pa je leta 1969 pridobil doktorat iz splošne patologije in leta 1970 doktorat iz biokemije. Delal je na Inštitutu za splošno patologijo pod vodstvom Massima Aloisija, kjer je raziskoval funkcijo mitohondrijev in kasneje sodeloval z Giovannijem Felicem Azzoneom pri odkritju permeabilnostnega prehoda pore. Leta 1966 je kot štipendist delal na Oddelku za biokemijo Univerze v Bristolu, kjer se je osredotočil na transportne proteine mitohondrijev, in od leta 1967 do 1969 kot raziskovalec na Oddelku za biofiziko Univerze v Pensilvaniji, kjer je raziskoval funkcije mitohondrijskih membran.

V zgodnjih 1970-ih se je vrnil v Italijo in leta 1973 postal profesor. Leta 1977 se je preselil v Bern v Švici, kjer je postal profesor biokemije na Univerzi v Bernu. Na Univerzi v Bernu je bil vodja Oddelka za medicinsko kemijo na Inštitutu za medicino, kasneje pa je od leta 1984 do 2005 deloval kot profesor in direktor Inštituta za biokemijo in molekularno biologijo, nato pa je bil imenovan za zaslužnega profesorja.

Azzi je bil član Svetovalnega odbora za znanstveno in biološko programiranje (ISAB/IBSP) pri Unescu od leta 1997 do 2015. Med letoma 2006 in 2012 je bil predsednik Mednarodne zveze za biokemijo in molekularno biologijo, od 2013 do 2015 pa je bil njen pretekli predsednik. Od leta 2007 do 2010 je bil predsednik Društva za raziskave prostih radikalov, od 2010 do 2013 pa pretekli predsednik.

## Raziskave

Azzi je raziskoval mehanizme, s katerimi vitamin E in likopen preprečujeta raka na prostati, in odkril transportni nosilec za asparaginsko in glutaminsko kislino v mitohondrijih. Pregledal je vloge alfa-tokoferola, ki presegajo njegove antioksidativne lastnosti, in sicer njegovo vlogo pri celičnem signaliziranju, genski regulaciji in preprečevanju bolezni. V skupnem študiju z Achimom Stockerjem je raziskal funkcije alfa-tokoferola, pri čemer je razkril njegovo selektivno antioksidativno vlogo, neantioksidativne mehanizme in učinke na celične procese, vključno z zaviranjem protein kinaze C in gensko transkripcijo. Prav tako je raziskal učinke alfa-tokoferola na proliferacijo celic, pri čemer je ugotovil, da zavira proliferacijo gladkih mišičnih celic žil na koncentracijsko odvisen način preko zaviranja protein kinaze C. Njegove ugotovitve so pokazale, da alfa-tokoferol nima kompenzacijskega antioksidativnega odziva v primeru pomanjkanja. Nadalje je raziskal učinek likopena, samostojno ali v kombinaciji z drugimi antioksidanti, na rast celičnih linij prostate karcinoma in ugotovil, da likopen sam ni močan zaviralec, vendar njegova kombinacija z alfa-tokoferolom močno zavira proliferacijo celic na sinergističen način. Pri preučevanju vloge protein kinaze C v signalni transdukciji je poudaril njeno aktivacijo z različnimi snovmi in njeno vpletenost v promocijo tumorjev, pri čemer je pozval k nadaljnjim raziskavam njenih fizioloških substratov. Njegovo delo je prav tako analiziralo nastanek vodikovega peroksida v dihalni verigi mitohondrijev, pri čemer je superoksidni radikal identificiral kot predhodnik HO generacije.

Azzi je napisal učbenike, vključno z Membrane Proteins: Isolation and Characterization (1986), Dynamics of Membrane Proteins and Cellular Energetics (1988) in Organelles in Eukaryotic Cells: Molecular Structure and Interactions (1989). Leta 1989 je skupaj z Zdenekom Drahoto in Sergiom Papajem uredil knjigo Molecular Basis of Membrane-Associated Diseases, ki preučuje molekularne spremembe v bioloških membranah, povezane z boleznimi, kot so lizosomske, peroksisomske in mitohondrijske motnje, encimski defekti in receptorji, povezani z onkogeni. Istega leta je skupaj s Katarzyno A. Nalecz, Maciejem J. Naleczom in Lechom Wojtczakom uredil knjigo Anion Carriers of Mitochondrial Membranes, ki obravnava strukturo, funkcijo, izolacijo, transportno kinetiko in presnovno regulacijo mitohondrijskih anionskih prenašalcev. Leta 2000 je skupaj s Petrom Rosenom, Hansom J. Tritschlerjem in Glennom A. Kingom napisal knjigo Antioxidants in Diabetes Management (Oxidative Stress and Disease), ki raziskuje oksidativni stres pri sladkorni bolezni in potencial antioksidantnih terapij. V recenziji knjige za Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism je Kailash Prasad zapisal: »Avtorji si zaslužijo pohvale za odlično delo pri pripravi jedrnatega pregleda patofiziologije, povezane z razvojem sladkorne bolezni in njenih povezanih zapletov, ter priložnosti, ki jih antioksidanti morda ponujajo za zdravljenje sladkorne bolezni.«

# 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests

On 12 December, the Hong Kong government announced that it would ban the wearing of face masks at protests, citing the need to maintain public order. The ban was condemned by the opposition and human rights groups, who said it was a violation of the right to freedom of expression.

# 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests

The 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests were a series of pro-democracy demonstrations and civil resistance in Hong Kong that began in late 2019 and continued into 2020. The protests were sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China for trial. The protests were the largest in Hong Kong since the 2014 Umbrella Movement.

The protests were marked by a series of large-scale demonstrations, often involving hundreds of thousands of people, and a variety of tactics, including sit-ins, roadblocks, and occupations of public spaces. The protesters demanded the full implementation of universal suffrage, an independent investigation into alleged police brutality, the release of arrested protesters, and the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam.

The protests were met with a heavy-handed response from the Hong Kong government and police, which included the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons. The protests were also met with counter-protests from pro-Beijing groups, and there were several instances of violence between protesters and counter-protesters.

The protests were a major test for the Hong Kong government and police, and they raised concerns about the erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong. The protests also had a significant impact on Hong Kong's economy and tourism industry.

The protests eventually subsided in early 2020, but the underlying issues that sparked them remain unresolved. The protests were a watershed moment in Hong Kong's history, and they continue to have a profound impact on the city's politics and society.

## Background

The protests were sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China for trial. The bill was seen as a threat to Hong Kong's autonomy and judicial independence.

The protests were also fueled by a variety of other grievances, including:

* The erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong.

* The perceived corruption of the Hong Kong government.

* The high cost of living in Hong Kong.

* The lack of affordable housing.

* The lack of democracy in Hong Kong.

## Timeline

The protests began in late 2019 and continued into 2020. The timeline of the protests is as follows:

# 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests

On 12 November, the Hong Kong government announced that it would ban face masks in public assemblies, citing the need to maintain public order. The ban was enacted on 4 October 2019, and was the first time the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance had been invoked since 1967. The ban was challenged in court by the Civil Rights Observer, a local human rights group. On 18 November, the High Court ruled that the ban was unconstitutional, and the government appealed the decision. On 29 November, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's ruling, upholding the ban. The government's decision to invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance was widely criticised by pro-democracy figures and international human rights groups, who argued that it was an excessive and disproportionate response to the protests.

## 2020

On 1 January 2020, thousands of protesters gathered in Victoria Park for the annual New Year's Day march, which was organised by the Civil Human Rights Front. The march was the first major protest of the year, and it was attended by a diverse range of people, including families with young children. The protesters called for the full implementation of the five demands, and they also expressed their opposition to the government's decision to invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance.

On 1 February, the Hong Kong government announced that it would be withdrawing the extradition bill. The announcement was made by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who also apologised for the "mistakes" that had been made in handling the protests. The withdrawal of the extradition bill was one of the five demands of the protesters, and it was seen as a major victory for the pro-democracy movement.

Despite the withdrawal of the extradition bill, the protests continued. On 8 February, hundreds of thousands of people marched through the streets of Hong Kong to demand the full implementation of the five demands. The march was organised by the Civil Human Rights Front, and it was the largest protest of the year.

On 12 February, the Hong Kong government announced that it would be implementing a new round of measures to address the protesters' demands. The measures included the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into the protests, the release of all arrested protesters, and the withdrawal of the mask ban. The government's announcement was welcomed by some protesters, but it was also met with scepticism, as many protesters felt that the measures did not go far enough.

# 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests

On 12 November, the Hong Kong government announced that it would ban face masks in public assemblies, citing the need to maintain public order. The ban was met with widespread criticism, with the opposition and legal experts arguing that it was unconstitutional and would only escalate the conflict. The ban was challenged in court, and on 18 November, the High Court ruled that the ban was unconstitutional, stating that it violated the right to freedom of expression. The government appealed the decision, and on 29 November, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's ruling, effectively reinstating the ban.

## 2020

On 1 January 2020, thousands of protesters gathered in Victoria Park to mark the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese rule. The event was peaceful, with protesters calling for democracy and an end to police brutality.

On 12 January, the Hong Kong government announced that it would be introducing a new national security law, which would criminalize acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces. The law was met with widespread opposition, with critics arguing that it would erode Hong Kong's autonomy and freedom.

On 1 February, the Hong Kong government announced that it would be postponing the legislative elections, which were scheduled for September 2020, citing the need to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The decision was met with widespread criticism, with opposition figures and pro-democracy activists accusing the government of using the pandemic as an excuse to delay the elections and maintain its grip on power.

On 30 May, the Hong Kong government passed the national security law, which criminalized acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces. The law was met with widespread condemnation, with critics arguing that it would stifle dissent and freedom of expression.

On 1 July, the Hong Kong government celebrated the 23rd anniversary of the handover from British to Chinese rule. The celebrations were muted, with many residents expressing their dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the protests and the new national security law.

On 12 July, the Hong Kong government announced that it would be introducing a new electoral reform package, which would limit the number of pro-democracy candidates in elections and give the government more control over the selection of candidates. The reform package was met with widespread opposition, with pro-democracy activists and opposition figures arguing that it would further erode Hong Kong's democracy.

On 1 August, the Hong Kong government announced that it would be banning the display of the British flag in public, citing the need to maintain national security. The ban was met with widespread criticism, with critics arguing that it was an attack on Hong Kong's history and culture.

On 1 September, the Hong Kong government announced that it would be introducing a new law that would criminalize disrespect for the Chinese national anthem. The law was met with widespread opposition, with critics arguing that it would stifle freedom of expression.

On 1 October, the Hong Kong government celebrated the 24th anniversary of the handover from British to Chinese rule. The celebrations were again muted, with many residents expressing their dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the protests and the new national security law.

On 1 November, the Hong Kong government announced that it would be introducing a new law that would criminalize the possession of pro-independence materials. The law was met with widespread opposition, with critics arguing that it would stifle freedom of expression.

On 1 December, the Hong Kong government announced that it would be introducing a new law that would criminalize the display of the pro-democracy flag. The law was met with widespread opposition, with critics arguing that it would stifle freedom of expression.

On 1 January 2021, the Hong Kong government celebrated the 25th anniversary of the handover from British to Chinese rule. The celebrations were again muted, with many residents expressing their dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the protests and the new national security law.

## Aftermath

The 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests had a profound impact on Hong Kong and its relationship with China. The protests were a watershed moment in Hong Kong's history, and they had far-reaching consequences for the city's future.

One of the most immediate consequences of the protests was the passage of the national security law. The law criminalized acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces, and it was seen as a major blow to Hong Kong's autonomy and freedom.

The protests also had a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Hong Kong. The government's crackdown on dissent, including the banning of face masks, the postponement of elections, and the introduction of new laws criminalizing disrespect for the national anthem and the possession of pro-independence materials, was seen as a further erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms.

The protests also had a significant impact on Hong Kong's economy. The tourism industry, which had been a major source of revenue for the city, was severely impacted by the protests. Businesses were also affected by the protests, with many companies either closing down or relocating to other parts of the world.

The protests also had a profound impact on Hong Kong's politics. The pro-democracy camp was weakened by the protests, and the government was able to consolidate its power. The opposition was marginalized, and the government was able to push through its agenda without much opposition.

The 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests were a complex and multifaceted event that had a profound impact on Hong Kong and its relationship with China. They were a testament to the resilience of the people of Hong Kong and their commitment to democracy and freedom. However, the protests also highlighted the fragility of Hong Kong's autonomy and the challenges that the city faces in the years ahead.

# 2019–202s

The 2019–20s were a series of protests in the United States against the Trump administration's family separation policy. The protests were organized by the group ShutDownDC, which was founded in 2018. The protests were held in Washington, D.C., and other cities across the United States.

## Background

The protests were in response to the Trump administration's family separation policy, which separated children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border. The policy was implemented in April 2018 and was widely condemned by the public and by human rights groups.

The protests were also in response to the Trump administration's decision to end the policy in June 2018. The protests were held to demand that the Trump administration reunite the families that had been separated and to end the policy permanently.

## Protests

The protests were held on various dates from September 2019 to January 2020. The protests were typically held on weekends and were attended by thousands of people.

The protests were peaceful and were marked by a variety of activities, including speeches, music, and art. The protesters also held signs and chanted slogans such as "Families belong together" and "No human is illegal."

The protests were covered by a variety of media outlets, including CNN, Fox News, and The New York Times.

## Impact

The protests had a significant impact on public opinion and on the Trump administration's family separation policy. The protests helped to raise awareness of the issue and to put pressure on the Trump administration to reunite the families that had been separated.

The protests also led to a number of changes in the Trump administration's policy. In November 2019, the Trump administration announced that it would end its policy of separating families at the border. The administration also announced that it would reunite the families that had been separated.

The protests were a success in achieving their goals. They helped to raise awareness of the issue of family separation and they put pressure on the Trump administration to end the policy.

## Legacy

The 2019–20s protests are an important part of the history of the Trump administration and of the fight for immigrant rights in the United States. They are a reminder of the power of peaceful protest and of the importance of standing up for what is right.

# 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests

On 12 November, the Hong Kong government announced that it would ban face masks in public assemblies, with exceptions for those with medical needs. The ban was enacted on 4 October 2019, and was the first time the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance had been invoked since 1967. The ban was challenged in court by the Civil Human Rights Front, and on 18 November, the High Court ruled that the ban was unconstitutional. The government appealed the decision, and on 29 November, the Court of Final Appeal upheld the ban.
